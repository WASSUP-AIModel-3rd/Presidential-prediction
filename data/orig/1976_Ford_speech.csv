0,Gerald R. Ford ,"October 16, 1974","['Thank you very, very much, Charley Thone. Distinguished public officials, candidates, all of you wonderful, wonderful people from Lincoln, the State of Nebraska, and elsewhere:', 'I am just tremendously impressed with the size of the crowd, the enthusiasm, and naturally, I am deeply appreciative of the kind, kind comments made concerning my wife Betty. She is doing great, and it is the prayers and the good wishes of literally thousands and thousands of people, not only in America but elsewhere, that have made her recovery faster and better. And I thank you on behalf of her.', 'This has been a wonderful day, and we are three-quarters of the way through it. I started in Kansas City this morning with a breakfast. We had a wonderful meeting in South Dakota. We are here in Lincoln. We are going to Indianapolis for a dinner and a meeting tonight, and back to Washington and the White House this evening.', ""Now, I don't know what my scheduler wants for Christmas, but let me tell you I am going to give him a map, so that he understands what travel means."", 'I am delighted to see Bob Devaney1 here. You know we Michiganders think we had some impact on the great success that Bob has brought to the State of Nebraska, the success that the Cornhuskers have had. And I watched, as a has-been athlete and a onetime football player, some of the great games that Nebraska has played under his leadership.', ""Let me just say this--and I pass no judgment, because there is nothing I dislike more than grandstand quarterbacks or Monday-morning experts, and I don't know what happened over there the other day in the last few minutes of that ball game--but I have learned, as an ex-football player and as an ex-football coach a long time back when the ball was round, that there is a great relationship between football or athletic competition and coaching and politics."", 'And if I might just say a word to Bob in that regard, I found that both as far as coaches and athletic directors are concerned--and politicians--that one day they will name a street after you and the next day they will chase you down it. [Laughter]', 'As Charley Thone said in the introduction, I was born in Nebraska, in Omaha, just a few miles down the pike here. And I am proud of it, and I am delighted to be back here.', 'Now, I left when I was about 18 months old, and depending on how you put it, I was either exported or deported. But I am glad to be back under any circumstances.', 'It is wonderful to see Charley Thone here. I understand Charley\'s campaign theme is ""Thone works."" Well, I can attest to that. For quite a few years I was the minority leader in the House of Representatives while Charley was in the House, and I can say without any hesitation, qualification, or reservation that Charley Thone was one of the hardest, most conscientious, most dedicated workers in the House of Representatives. And if I was in this district, Democrat or Republican, I would vote for Charley Thone.', 'And he had two other fine, fine Nebraskans alongside of him in the House of Representatives--John McCollister, an outstanding Member of the House, the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, a committee that has tremendous responsibilities that relate directly to the problems you have here in the State of Nebraska. And I am sure in this great crowd there are some people that can help John McCollister, and because I think so highly of him, I hope and trust that they will do everything they possibly can to see that Charley does come back to continue his fine work in the House of Representatives.', 'You do have in the State of Nebraska one of our senior statesmen leaving, leaving of his own free will. We have Dave Martin who served so ably and so well. Dave is [not] coming back, but I hope and trust that the people of that Congressional district send to replace Dave Martin, Mrs. Helen Smith, who I am sure will carry on the fine tradition that Dave Martin established in the representation of that Congressional district.', 'And if Helen has friends here, go out and do the same thing for her that you have done for Dave Martin, and I would thank you for it.It is Mrs. Haven Martin, Virginia Martin, and I apologize.2', ""But let me at this point make one or two observations and comments concerning some of the problems we have in America. I know that this great State-because I have visited many places in it. I've traveled across a good portion of the State--north, south, east, and west. I know that Nebraska is one of the most vitally important producers of food in all 50 States."", ""And I know, from talking with some of the members of the Congressional delegation, that farmers have had some difficult times for a wide variety of reasons --the elements; a lack of, maybe, fertilizer; and some other problems that I won't enumerate. But I want to compliment the farmers of the State of Nebraska for the job they have done. They deserve your applause and your support, because they are real inflation fighters that have and can contribute."", 'In return for the request that I have made to each and every one of them that they produce to full capacity, I think we ought to make some commitments to them. And let me enumerate some commitments that I will make, representing the executive branch of the Government.', 'Number one, I am committed to give them the fuel and the fertilizer for them to do the job. Even though we are going to cut back 1 million barrels of imported fuel oil every day, the farmers will get fuel and fertilizer if we have to allocate it arbitrarily.', ""Prior to my speech to the Congress a week or so ago, I was quoted extensively by a lot of people who thought they were reading my mind. And they were reading it on the belief that I was going to ask the Congress to pass an increase in the Federal gasoline tax. Well, some of these oracle readers or people who thought they could read my mind were 100 percent wrong. I did not ask for a gas tax; I am opposed to a gas tax; and, I know the Congress won't pass one."", 'About a week ago Saturday, I was faced with a real tough decision. There had been some very substantial orders placed for wheat and corn for shipment overseas.', 'Now, I am against the export controls for our farm commodities, and I do not intend to impose them. But at the same time, because I do feel I have an obligation to protect adequate reserves, we are going to monitor those sales. We will permit the sales of reasonable amounts phased over a reasonable period of time so our farmers will be able to sell their commodities, because those commodities are important as we, a great country, sell those things abroad that are necessary for our balance of payments. So the farmers can have full assurance from me: There will be no blanket embargo on the products they produce on the land with their own toil.', ""One day last week, Charley Thone and a number of other Congressmen, Democrats as well as Republicans, along with some dairy farmers, came to the White House to talk to me about the problems of the dairy farmer. I know the dairy farmer in America has been hit by rising costs. I know the dairy farmer has been hit with some of the problems of getting an adequate price in the marketplace. The cost-price squeeze to the dairy farmer is a serious one. But I make a pledge here today as I did in Sioux Fails earlier: We are not going to let subsidized foreign dairy imports destroy the American dairy farmers' domestic market."", 'Now, having made these pledges to the farmers who have done so much over the years. and who will do so much in the future, I feel obligated to make a comment on a sad and tragic incident that happened in Wisconsin yesterday.', 'Although I understand the frustrations of the farmers in Wisconsin who slaughtered their cattle yesterday, I am deeply concerned at this wasteful protest when we as Americans are trying to increase the supply of food for 213 million Americans and millions all over the world. Unfortunately, these actions contributed nothing to the solution of the problem or to the problem of inflation which concerns all of us.', 'I am aware, as I said earlier, of the cost-price squeeze in which livestock producers and feeders and dairymen find themselves. And to do whatever I can, I am meeting with representatives from those groups in Washington within a relatively short period of time to find out what they recommend that their Government do in this very serious problem, in this dilemma that they face.', ""I can only say that I hope and trust that what transpired in Wisconsin yesterday will not be duplicated. It didn't help them. It won't help solve the problem that they face, and it won't help the problem that we face as Americans, which is more food for all of us. And so I urge, to the extent that you can, that you counsel with them or with those who have any similar ideas. We are going to work with them. We are going to solve their problem, and they should not do in the future what a few did yesterday."", 'In conclusion, let me discuss very quickly these problems that I think we face here in Nebraska and others face around our 50 States. We have a problem concerning our economy.', 'About a week or 10 days ago, I submitted to the Congress, to the American people, a 31-provision program that is aimed at tightening up the screws on inflation and, at the same time, giving us the strength to improve our economy. This program requires certain actions by the Congress. This program requires certain individual efforts by volunteers throughout the country. I have faith in the Congress and faith in the American people. We are going to win the battle against inflation, and we are going to have a strong, burgeoning economy so all of us will be better off.', 'The role of the United States on a global basis is aimed at building peace not only for ourselves but for the world as a whole. I was in Kansas City this morning, and I stayed last night in a hotel where a great Democratic President, 20-some years ago, signed a bill which was called the Greek-Turkish aid bill. And that legislation was sponsored and promoted and guided through the Congress by a great Republican statesman from Michigan, Senator Arthur Vandenburg.', 'And as a result of bipartisan leadership in the field of foreign policy between a Democratic President and a Republican Congress, we laid the foundation for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization which has kept the peace in Western Europe for almost 30 years.', 'And this kind of bipartisanship is essential today as it was during the days of Harry Truman and Arthur Vandenburg. And I can assure you that as a Republican President, I will work with a Democratic Congress to continue a bipartisan foreign policy that is good for America and good for the rest of the world.', ""Now, one final comment: I was reading the polls the other day, and the polls seem to indicate that the Republican Party is going to take some kind of a shellacking on November 5. I don't happen to agree with that, but that is what some of the experts were speculating or forecasting."", 'But let me tell you what could happen if they are right. They could end up with a veto-proof Congress, and what does that mean? It means that the important balance between the executive branch, the Congress, and the judicial branches of our Government will be upset. And if we look back over the history of this country, we know that balance in government has contributed significantly to the progress we have made, to the freedom that we have.', ""A veto-proof Congress will upset that balance. The American people don't want a dictatorship in the White House or in the Congress or in the Court. They want a system of checks and balances that protect their freedom and give to each and every one of us a better life. And so I say, instead of a veto-proof Congress, I hope and trust that every one of you will work for an inflation-proof Congress on November 5."", 'And now, let me just conclude by thanking every one of you for being here. It is a thrill. It is a wonderful afternoon.', 'Charley, I thank you for the kind words in the introduction. I wish you well so you will be back to help us. I hope and trust that John McCollister is back, that Mrs. Smith is with us so that they can join your two great Senators, Roman Hruska and Carl Curtis, with a good, strong Congress in 1975.', 'Thank you very, very much.']"
1,Gerald R. Ford ,"October 16, 1974","['Thank you very, very much, my good friend and former colleague in the House of Representatives, Jim Abdnor. And may I express from the bottom of my heart the tremendous welcome, the enthusiasm and the warmth of this reception. I cannot in any words in my vocabulary express my deep gratitude and appreciation. Thank you very, very much.', ""And if I might on a very personal note good many years ago I matriculated to the University of Michigan. This was back in 1931, and I didn't have much money, but a woman here today and her husband made it possible for me to rent a room on the third floor--the cheapest part of their rooming house--at the cost of $4 a week to go to the University. And I want to thank Elizabeth Van Wye, the widow of John Van Wye, who was connected with your university for a long, long time. Elizabeth, it is nice to see you."", 'It is good to be back in South Dakota. I have been here a good many times. And I especially enjoy it here in the Mount Rushmore area. There are four faces on that great, great national monument. One is a Federalist, one is a Democrat, and two are historical pillars of the Republican Party. This is the kind of political scorecard that I like in South Dakota.', 'Naturally, I am delighted to be on the same platform with some truly fine, outstanding people who fit the tradition of Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, and other greats in our political system--people like Jim Abdnor, Leo Thorsness, John Olson, Larry Pressler.', 'Leo, as you know better than I--well, he mentioned as we were coming in that the hunting season opened in South Dakota last Saturday, and by coincidence, you might have seen in the newspapers or on TV in the last week or so that the White House has a new addition.', 'My daughter Susan and Dave Kennerly, the new White House photographer, got together and surprised me and my wife Betty with a new, 8-month-old golden retriever. The Fords had had two golden retrievers in the last 20 years. Unfortunately, both had passed away. So, I would like to tell you a story about how Dave and Susan acquired this new White House tenant.', 'They called up a very highly recommended kennel and said they wanted to buy a golden retriever puppy. The owner of the kennel said, ""Fine. Who will the owner be?"" And they said, ""It is a surprise."" They would like to keep it a secret.', ""Well, the kennel owner said he didn't sell his fine dogs under those circumstances. He would have to know if the puppy was going to have a good owner, a nice home."", 'So, Susan and Dave assured the kennel owner that it would be and that the parents were friendly, middle-aged, and lived in a big white house with a fence around it.', 'The kennel owner said, well, that sounded all right. Do they own it or do they rent it?', 'Well, Susan and Dave thought a minute and said, ""Well, I guess you might call it public housing.""', 'Well, the kennel owner said that was all right. Now, he also added, ""This is a big dog. It likes to eat. It will need a lot of food. Does the father have a steady job?""', 'Well, Susan and David were stuck with an answer to that question. [Laughter]', ""All I can say is I've heard a lot about your great hunting out here. I sometime hope that I can come out and enjoy the great outdoor facilities and the great outdoor opportunities you have in South Dakota which I don't think are matched by any State in the Union."", 'Your fine Congressman, Jim Abdnor, flew with me from Washington, and I can assure you from the time that I had a close opportunity to work with him in the House of Representatives--he was sworn in in January of 1973--that you in South Dakota are fortunate to have someone who understands the problems of the farmers, the problems of balancing a budget, the problems of handling taxes in the right and the best way. I just think you in South Dakota have a great, great Congressman in Jim Abdnor.', 'And having looked at a lot of Congressmen over 25 years--some of them kind of coming and going like Greyhound buses--Jim Abdnor is the kind of a person I would vote to keep in Congress, because he does a good job for his people at home.', 'Leo Thorsness--I heard about Leo before he got into the political arena, and his reputation then was one that I envied, a reputation of total dedication to his country, a dedication to principles under the most adverse circumstances, a man with a strong background, a strong background based on real, deep conviction about the principles that are so essential to make our country an even better land in the future.', 'I know that Leo will be a full-time fighter against inflation on a year-in and year-out basis instead of once every 6 years at election time.', 'And I happen to think that Larry Pressler can do a great job for you in the Congress.', 'Leo and Larry will bring you, when elected November 5, a full strength of sound people handling your money and your problems in the House as well as the Senate.', ""And of course, under the theory that I believe in, that we don't have to make all the decisions and all the judgments in Washington, that we need sound, responsible, thoughtful people at the State and local level, we need John Olson to be the next Governor of the State of South Dakota."", 'And if I might, in a very personal way, explain to you why I am here in South Dakota. There has been some criticism that maybe the President ought to stay in the White House, and work in the Oval Office, and never leave the banks of the Potomac.', ""I don't agree with that. I happen to believe that the American people have a right to see their President and to hear him defend the kind of programs that he believes are in the best interest of our country, both at home and abroad."", 'I think I get a better understanding of what people in South Dakota want and believe by being right here in this great auditorium rather than peering out of some window in the White House.', 'You can tell me with criticism, with comments, with endorsements of what we are doing right or what we are doing wrong, and I can get it better at the grassroots than I can from some ivory tower on the banks of the Potomac.And I thank you for coming here just to give me that advice. I appreciate it.', 'As I see it, we have got two or three major problems in this country. One, we have got to lick the battle of inflation and keep our economy strong at the same time.', 'And I submitted to the Congress a week ago, on Tuesday, a 31-proposition package that, if enacted, if supported, will give us a better handle and success against inflation and, if enacted and supported by the American people, will keep us going on a steady, steady course upward to provide a better and better living for all our people.', 'And I happen to think guys like Jim Abdnor, Leo Thorsness are the kind of people than can work at helping in the problems not only at home but abroad.', ""What we need in this country is not a partisan foreign policy. Some 26 years ago it was my privilege to go as a brand new freshman Congressman to the Nation's Capital, and I was engulfed by a bipartisan foreign policy with a Democratic President, Harry Truman, working with a Republican Congress in the 80th Congress. And those two people representing the executive branch, on the one hand, and the Congress, on the other, gave us peace in Western Europe, helped us to build the kind of policy that has been good for us in Western Europe for almost 30 years."", 'What we need is a bipartisan foreign policy, and that can be supplied by Jim Abdnor, by Leo, by Larry Pressler. We need that kind of support if we are going to keep the peace and build the peace in the future. And I hope you support them for those two very, very good reasons.', 'I know the State of South Dakota is one of the greatest States in the Union for many reasons. But you have a particular pride, a special feeling about the contributions that this great State of South Dakota does in being a significant part of the breadbasket of not only the United States but the world.', 'Now let me talk, if I might, about the part that farmers and those associated with them can do in this great struggle to win the battle against inflation.', 'I have assured the farmers of this and every State that they will have all the fuel, all the fertilizer that they need to harvest their bountiful crops this year and next year. They will be in your hands.', 'And let me add one other thing while I am talking about fuel. Prior to my speech a week ago, everybody else but myself was telling the American people what I was going to say about gasoline taxes. Well, I have now said or given my own views, but I want to reiterate it right here to you in South Dakota: I am vigorously opposed to any additional Federal tax on gasoline, and I will fight it as hard as I possibly can.', 'We want to keep this country rolling, not parked on a dead-end street.', 'Let me add one special concern that I had for the people of South Dakota when this issue was presented to me and I rejected it. I thought of the people of South Dakota and other States who have to travel not a couple of miles but many miles to go to the doctor or to the hospital. I thought about the people in South Dakota who have to go from their farms or their ranch to the implement dealer or to the community where they trade.', 'A gasoline tax would unfairly, in my judgment, penalize those people. And for that reason, among many others, I rejected it. And we are not going to have it as long as I am in the White House.', 'There are some other things that have to be done, not just in agriculture, but they have to be done in agriculture. We have got to increase productivity. But I always like to add, when talking about productivity, that the statistics show that in the last 20 or more years, the farmers of America have increased their productivity more than any other segment of our economy in the whole United States, and I applaud you for it.', ""But just because you are the champs doesn't mean you can't do better. And so I am urging every one of you to make that little extra effort to make sure that we get the maximum from our soil and from the toil of all of you."", 'Now there is one question that is always raised that if the farmer produces more, responds to the demands of people in this country and around the world, what kind of protection, what kind of guarantee does the farmer who has made this special effort get?', 'Let me add this: I promise a fair return, a fully fair and adequate return to the farmers of America, a fair profit on what you put in on your time, your labor, your investment, and your facilities. This is what you deserve, and this is what we have to guarantee.', 'And let me add, if I might, the problems and the concerns of the people of rural America will not be buried under the concrete of big city interests.', 'There is one comment I would like to make, and it is somewhat a sad one. I am particularly disturbed by the wasteful protest, the protest resulting in the slaughtering of calves in Wisconsin just yesterday, at a time when we are trying to increase the supply of food.', 'I fully recognize the frustration that prompted this shocking demonstration, but their actions, I think, even if they reflect on it themselves, will contribute nothing, nothing toward a solution to the problem that they face or the problems that our country faces.', 'I am aware of the cost-price squeeze in which livestock producers and feeders find themselves. I have requested from the Department of Agriculture and every other department in the Federal Government the reports that I can look at and analyze, and I will meet very shortly at the White House with fair representation of the farmers and ranchers to get their solutions from them directly.', 'I am disturbed by the disparity between the reduced earnings of the cattlegrowers and the higher prices charged to consumers throughout the Nation on the shelves of the supermarkets. And I am asking the new Council on Wage and Price Stability to examine the reasons behind this gap which is paid to the farmer and what must be paid on the other end of the line by the individual consumer.', 'Something is obviously wrong, and I intend to do what I can to find out the cause and do something about it.', 'Our livestock producers here in South Dakota obviously cannot tolerate a situation in which calves cost more to raise than they bring at the marketplace, but there certainly is a better way of redressing these legitimate grievances than by the drastic and wasteful destruction of our food supply.', ""Now there is another problem which equally concerns me--the tremendous cost-price squeeze in which America's dairymen find themselves. I met last Friday in Washington in the Cabinet Room with a representative group of dairy farmers on the one hand and a group of Democratic and Republican Congressmen and Senators on the other. And they outlined to me the practical problems that the dairy producers in their respective States are faced with."", 'I am very sympathetic to the problem. I understand the concern of those dairy producers that the United States dairy price system should not be allowed--and this is very important--that this price system should not be allowed to be undermined by efforts of foreign dairy producers.', 'Now some of these foreign dairy producers, as we know from the sampling that we have taken, are seeking to shift the burden of their own cost-price problems to the United States market, aided by artificial incentives from their own government.', 'And because of my own concern about the economic problems dairymen are facing, I intend today announcing that no action will be taken to change the present system of dairy import quotas without a thorough review of market conditions and full opportunity for our dairy producers to be heard at that time.', 'I think the record proves that our farmers can compete with any group of farmers or the farmers from any nation throughout the world. And I am looking forward to those negotiations where we can equalize our opportunities to compete with foreign markets around the world.', 'Now, these are some of the reasons I am here, to listen to what you have to say, to get your reactions to what I say. I have a button up here that says ""WIN."" WIN now. And I see some signs and I see some buttons in the crowd here.', 'People of the United States have always been strong. We have met adversity when we were challenged from abroad. We have met adversity when we were faced with internal difficulties--the Depression and the conflicts of one kind or another--that have plagued us over some 200 years.', 'But we found one answer in the political arena that gives us the opportunity to present alternative solutions, to permit candidates who have one philosophy and candidates who have another to meet in the political arena. And we have developed over a period of some 200 years in this great country a two-party system that is wholesome and healthy and gives us in all 50 States the opportunity to participate.', 'Now, this system of a two-party arrangement protects us because it is an integral part of a system of checks and balances, a system that is not in the Constitution but it is one that has been developed as our political challenges have gone from almost 200 years ago to today.', 'But if we ever lose the two-party system, if we ever go to a one-party system, we will have the same problems that they have behind the Iron Curtain. If we ever go to a multi-party system with five or ten parties, we will lose that strength that comes from what we have today.', 'And so, as you proceed with this great election in the State of South Dakota on November 5, what you are really doing is participating in the continuation of a system that has given us so much materially and ideologically, that has made America a blessed nation of some 213 million people; a country that has representative government; a country that gives you the freedom of choice in many, many ways as well as politically.', 'And this election that comes up gives you an opportunity in the solemnity of the ballot box, a chance to make a choice, where you are the only judge, where you can decide what is best for your country.', 'Oh, I know there is no gun so mighty, no force so powerful as the quiet symbol of what you do and what others do throughout our country on November 5. It is the opportunity; it is the responsibility; actually, it is part of your contribution to a greater America. You can balance the ledger sheets of good government.', 'I have just an unbelievable faith in the people of South Dakota, as I do the people all over America. We can strengthen the two-party system. You can pick the best candidates, and we in America will be blessed by the good judgment of what you do in South Dakota and what your fellow Americans do in every State on November 5.', 'I thank you. It is a pleasure and a privilege to be here.', '[The President spoke at 1:27 p.m. at the Sioux Falls Arena. In his remarks, the President referred to Leo J. Thorsness, Republican candidate for United States Senator from South Dakota, and Larry Pressler, Republican candidate in the First Congressional District.', 'On departing from the arena at 2 p.m., the President spoke to a crowd that had gathered outside, as follows:]', 'Let me thank all of you--the young ones, the old ones, the middle-aged ones, the boys and girls, mothers and dads, grandmas and grandpas.', ""Well, it is just nice to be out here in this typical South Dakota weather in October, on October 15 [16]. Don't you always have it this way by this time of the year?"", 'Well, I am out here with some very good friends of mine--Jim Abdnor, who is your darned good Congressman, Leo Thorsness, Larry Pressler, and your candidate for Governor. And I appreciate your thoughtfulness concerning them.', 'But the main thing, I want to say a word or two to all of you. You have got the greatest, greatest country in the world, and all of you know it here in South Dakota just like we do in Michigan and people do in 48 other States. But if we are going to keep this kind of country, if we are going to maintain everything it stands for and do justice to the sacrifices that were made by your forefathers and mine, then we have to tighten our belts and sacrifice a little for another few months ahead of us.', 'Now the fact that you are all here gives me hope that in South Dakota you are going to do better than any other of the 50 States in the Union. I know that. Do I have your assurance?', 'You know, I have a little button here that says ""WIN."" I don\'t see any buttons on anybody in South Dakota that says ""lose."" All you want is to win, not for yourselves but for your country, and that is what I want, you want, and people in other States want.', 'So thank you for being here. It has been a tremendous, tremendous experience. I am deeply grateful. Good luck and God bless every one of you.', 'Thank you very, very much.']"
2,Gerald R. Ford ,"October 19, 1974","['Len Phillips, Strom Thurmond, Mayor Lyle, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:', 'It is a real thrill to be here in Rock Hill, to see this tremendous gathering, and to see the enthusiasm that you have and the warm welcome that you are giving me. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.', 'Now, some of you may not have noticed when this fine young lady came up to give the Pledge of Allegiance. I shook hands with her and thanked her, Len Phillips shook hands and thanked her, but you know what Strom Thurmond did? He kissed her. [Laughter]', 'Well, you know we have had a wonderful day so far. We were in Spartanburg, we were in Anderson, and now we are here in Rock Hill. It is obvious to me that when you get a little tired, the days get a little long. It is great to come to South Carolina and get revitalized.', ""I found that it gives you new life. Don't take my word for it. Ask Strom Thurmond. [Laughter]"", 'You know, the motto of the sovereign State of South Carolina is ""Prepared in Spirit and Resources."" Strom Thurmond certainly has that. In fact, there are 2 days in particular when Strom really proves that he is prepared in spirit and in resources. One is election day, the other is Father\'s Day. [Laughter]', 'I do, of course, want to add something that I say from the bottom of my heart. I have known Strom Thurmond all the time that I have been in Congress, the Vice Presidency, and the Presidency, and I can say nothing but the very finest about your senior Senator.', 'He is strong, he is courageous, he is intelligent, he is dedicated, he is a great Senator, and I admire him, as I am sure all of you do. But Strom and I need some help. Strom needs a good, strong Congressman from the Fifth Congressional District in the great State of South Carolina, and Len Phillips will be that on November 5.', 'During the day, I have had an opportunity to talk to Len. I know that Len Phillips has worked to develop his own business, and in the process of making that business successful, he has learned that you have to pay your bills. He has learned that you have to run a business effectively, that you have to take in more than you spend. And Len Phillips also knows that that is the way you ought to run the Federal Government.', ""Strom Thurmond was telling me on the way over here today that in the last 23 years, the Federal Government has balanced its budget, I think, 5 out of the 23. That is not a very good record. You couldn't run your household, your church, your business, your Boy Scout organization, your schools with that kind of record."", 'Now what we need in Washington to win the battle against inflation, among other things, is Members of the House as well as Members of the Senate who will stand up and be counted and spend less, so we can win the battle against inflation.', 'And Len Phillips will help Strom Thurmond and me in that most important. vital, essential responsibility.', 'I came down here for the purpose of renewing my acquaintanceship with many people of South Carolina. I came down to make some new friends. I came down here also for the purpose of enlisting all of you in the battle against inflation.', 'Now Strom and Len Phillips and I, we can do part of the job, but if we are going to win this battle against inflation, with those words up there--WIN-and with that button that I have--and I see many on others, ""Whip Inflation""-we have to have your help.', 'About 10 days ago, I gave a speech to the Congress of the United States, and I laid out in cold turkey 31 proposals whereby we could have a plan and a program to WIN. The Congress has a part of it, the President has a part of it, and all of you have a part of it with 213 million other Americans.', 'One hundred thousand-plus have written to the White House in the last week or so and enlisted. I urge you, every one of you, to join with Strom and Len Phillips and myself, enlist in the battle against inflation so that we can win for America.', 'I have said, and I think we all must concede, that inflation is public enemy number one. The plan and the program that I have suggested, that I have proposed, recommended, will put the lid on inflation. At the same time, it will do those things that are needed and necessary to provide us an expanding economy, a strong economy, a good economy.', ""But if we don't win this battle by conserving energy, by doing the other things that are an integral and important part of it, the great blessings of this country will not be for our younger generation."", 'I admire the sacrifices that have been made by the senior citizens who are here. I admire and respect you, and we thank you. You have done much to give us all what we have today.', 'But we have an obligation to these young people in the bands, in the Boy Scouts, the Camp Fire Girls, the Girl Scouts. We have an obligation to them, as this group had to us.', 'And so what we have to do is join the ranks, arm-in-arm, shoulder-to-shoulder, to spend less, and that means spend less of your taxpayer dollars so that we will have more for you to spend for yourself, for your city, for your State, for your country.', 'One of the important things to me and something that I like and enjoy about people from South Carolina is the political philosophy that you have--a philosophy that says yes. The government at the local, State, and Federal level, they are important, but the philosophy that you have--that you can stand and will stand on your own two feet--is what I believe in, and I respect you, I admire you for it.', 'Now we recognize that there are circumstances and problems that are beyond the scope and beyond the capability of individuals. But there are, unfortunately, people in the Congress and elsewhere in our society who think every problem has to be solved by some Government program or excessive Federal spending.', ""I don't agree with that. But what worries me, what worries me is that the people who have this philosophy are too strong, are getting too much of a stranglehold on some of our areas in our Federal Government and elsewhere. What they don't tell us when they propose all these benefits that they are going to give you from our Government, they don't tell you the end result, the final conclusion. They don't inform you that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have."", 'Now, South Carolina is one of the great States of this Union. South Carolina has had a long history and tradition of being strong in a crisis, whether it was from outside our continental limits, or whether it was from within. You have measured up to the challenges abroad and at home.', 'And you in South Carolina know that the strength of our form of government is one of balance. You had people that represented your great State when our Founding Fathers drafted the Constitution and when they went to the city of Philadelphia and put together that Constitution. They wove into it the concept of balance: a strong President in the White House, a strong Congress in the legislative branch, a strong judicial system, headed by the Supreme Court, a system of checks and balances to protect freedom and give opportunity to everybody to move ahead and live their own private lives.', 'But at some moments in our history there has been a shift of that balance. Now there are people who want to impose on this system a veto-proof Congress.', 'What does that mean? It means that they want to remove the checks and balances. They want all power in the Congress. The American people want balance for the protection of themselves, their families, their local, their State government.', ""We don't want a veto-proof Congress. We want a Congress that will reflect your views in Rock Hill, your views in South Carolina, working in a partnership with the President. And so, instead of a veto-proof Congress, I urge you to give me an inflation-proof Congress in November."", 'And I say from the bottom of my heart--because I know what he stands for, I know what his philosophy is, I know he has courage, I know he has character, I know he has background and experience--you can help Strom Thurmond in his struggles to do a good job in the United States Senate, you can help me, you can help yourself, you can help the State of South Carolina, you can help America by electing Len Phillips to the United States Congress.', 'Thank you very, very much.']"

Ford ,"October 19, 1974","[""Bill [Stevens], my former colleagues in the House of Representatives, Governor Jim Holshouser, our other candidates for the Congress, Jim Carson, the candidate for the Attorney General's office, and all of you who are here:"", 'It is just great to be in Greensboro, and you are wonderful. I love it, and I appreciate it. Thank you very, very much.', ""Let me start out by saying I am no stranger to North Carolina. I was down here a couple of months ago and played golf. For your safety's sake, I want you to know I didn't bring my golf clubs. [Laughter]"", 'But anyhow, I have been here a good many times. I served here for 9 months in the Navy. I went to law school here one summer. I have been down here to make a good many political campaign speeches. I had one son that went to Wake Forest University. I had another one that was entered in Duke this year, but decided he wanted to go out and be a ranch hand for 12 months, so he may come back.', 'But anyhow, I like North Carolina, and I am proud of my association with it.', 'This is a great crowd, but I want to warn you, this morning we started bright and early from Washington, D.C. We flew to Spartanburg, and then to Anderson, South Carolina, Rock Hill, and then to Greenville. They had anywhere from 7,000 to 12,000 people down there to see a Republican President, and believe me, they are on the move, and so are you in North Carolina.', 'Why do I say that? You have a great crowd here, and most of you, I am sure, would rather be out watching a good football game or doing something else.', 'But here is what you have done in the short span of time that I was in the Congress about 25 years. You have now a Republican Governor in Jim Holshouser, and he is a first-class chief executive.', 'And you have in Jesse Helms an outstanding Member of the United States Senate. You should be proud of him.', 'And I can speak with some considerable authority about the great people you have in the House of Representatives--Jim Broyhill, Earl Ruth, ""Vinegar Bend"" Mizell, Jim Martin, and pretty soon, about November 5, you are going to have Steve Ritchie and Ward Purrington.1 And if you don\'t, gee, I will be disappointed.', 'With all this power you have got here, you ought to make certain and positive that somebody as able as Steve and somebody as able as Ward takes the oath of office on January 3 in the House of Representatives. They will save you money, they will win the battle against inflation, they will give you good representation, and you will be darned proud of both of them. Do your best.', ""Now let's talk about the United States Senate. In Bill Stevens you have got an opportunity to put a fellow in that high office to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Jesse Helms. Isn't that what you want? Somebody who is going to be strong, determined, dedicated? And I will be so pleased if the great State of North Carolina sends that kind of Member to the United States Senate."", 'Now let me make two or three points. I know it is a little chilly, but nevertheless I want to talk heart-to-heart, straight-to-straight to you. I have gotten a lot of advice in recent weeks that I ought to sit in Washington, D.C., as President of the United States, read the polls and get discouraged and wring my hands and, you know, look out the window of the Oval Office and say, ""Gee, things are terrible.""', ""I think that is a lousy approach to the responsibilities of the President of the United States. I know all these experts are saying these things, that you can't change the results, and if I tried and I lost, then my Presidency for the next 2 years will go down the drain. I don't believe that. It is a lot better for me to be out talking to you in Greensboro than sitting around the Oval Office and wringing my hands."", ""I don't understand people who want to admit defeat. I have got a WIN button on, not a loser's button."", ""You know, the first election I ever participated in, boy, it taught me a good lesson, and it wasn't a lesson taught me by a Republican. It was a lesson that I learned from a good Democrat, Harry Truman. He was man enough, strong enough, convinced enough to come out here and fight for what he believed was right, and we are."", ""Harry Truman didn't win in 1948 by sitting in the Oval Office looking at all the polls. He came out here and fought and won. And America, under his leadership, had a great, great next 4 years."", 'I want your help right here in Greensboro, and I want your help in Charlotte, in Raleigh, and I want it everyplace else, in Winston-Salem. You have got an obligation, and so do I, and we don\'t achieve it by sitting on our hands and wringing our hands and saying, ""Gentlemen, the polls look terrible."" What is the matter with us? Have we lost that old fighting spirit? Have you?', ""All right, now let's talk about the issues. The issue is very clear. We have got a problem in the economy. We have got inflation that is too high, resulting from spending too much money for the last 20 years.Look, the sun is even coming out!"", 'We spent too much money for the last 20 years, and if my figures are right, you know who controlled the Congress for 19 out of the last 25 years? Our Democratic friends. They are the ones that made all the money available to be spent, and if we spent too much money, it is on their shoulders, not on ours.', ""But let's be reasonable and responsible about what we ought to do about it. I presented to the Congress about 10 days ago a good economic package that will whip inflation and keep our economy growing and constructive so young people will have jobs and older people will be taken care of. Now, how can you beat that?"", ""Now the problem is on the shoulders and on the backs of Congress. I have heard some criticism of my plan, but I haven't heard any solution. You know, a lot of talk is cheap, but a program presented for action will save America, and a lot of talk won't do much good."", 'And so, I urge you to put pressure on the Congress--Democrats and a few Republicans, too. They have to step up and bite the bullet, because the chips are too high. The chips are so high for the future and the preservation of this country.', ""We have got to lick inflation. If we don't, it will tear our Government asunder. It will destroy all the principles we believe in. It will weaken us in our resolution to keep peace abroad."", ""We have a great, great responsibility, individually and collectively. We can't just brush it off. We can't back away and say it is somebody else's responsibility. We, individually and collectively, have to stand up and fight for what we know is right."", 'Now, I am confident, I am optimistic, I believe in Bill Stevens, Ward Purrington, Steve Ritchie, Jim Broyhill, Jim Martin, Earl Ruth, ""Vinegar Bend"" Mizell--those are strong, fine people. They are good and they will do what is right for North Carolina.', 'They will do what is right for the country, and therefore, I leave this great State with a conviction that instead of a veto-proof Congress, that some of the power-hungry people want, a veto-proof Congress, we are going to end up with an inflation-proof Congress, and that is pretty darned good for America', ""One final point, if I might. About 200 years ago our forefathers put together the greatest document for the governing of people in the history of mankind. How well it has done for us. We have got freedom, we have opportunity, we have done pretty well materialistically. We are blessed, we are so blessed. And a basic ingredient of that is balance--balance, a system of checks and balances that doesn't let any one political party, any one President, any one Congress be the dictator. Americans don't like dictators."", 'But the people who want a veto-proof Congress in effect want a legislative dictatorship. They want one branch of the Federal Government to dominate and control all other branches of the Federal Government, and that is completely opposite of the fundamental concept of our Constitution.', 'And so, the best way I think you can avoid that legislative dictatorship is to make sure that you keep our Members of the House that I have mentioned-Jim Broyhill, ""Vinegar Bend,"" Jim Martin, and Earl Ruth--and add to them so that we avoid the veto-proof Congress, that is, a legislative dictatorship, and that we give to America a balance which is the basic ingredient that has contributed to our progress and our growth and our freedom and our liberties and opportunities.', 'Really, I look in your eyes and I plead with your hearts and I beg with your mind that you maximize your efforts in the next 10 days, 2 weeks, or 2 weeks and a half, because the stakes are very, very high.', ""And what you do, each one of you, can make a difference--your own vote and the votes that you can convince--that America doesn't want a legislative dictatorship; America wants a sound economic program, America wants good candidates like the ones we have serving them in the Congress."", 'Yes, I plead with you, I beg of you, not for yourselves, not for me, but for our country: Do your best.', 'Thank you very much.']"

And I deeply appreciate this tremendous crowd, the wonderful enthusiasm here on this occasion at this airport, and I can't express deeply enough my gratitude, my appreciation. Just thank you very, very much."", 'But let me say I am here primarily for three, maybe four reasons. Number one, I am here to enlist every one of you as well as all of your friends throughout the State of South Carolina in our WIN effort, which is to ""Whip Inflation Now.""', 'And I am here--and I am proud to be--to indicate my pride in the Republican candidates for State and Federal offices in the great State of South Carolina.', 'I am also here to extend my acquaintanceship, my friendship with people in the State of South Carolina. The ones that I have known and gotten acquainted with over the years are the kind of people we Michiganders like, and I hope I can find many, many more like you in the travels through the State of South Carolina today.', 'Within the last 10 days or 2 weeks, on two occasions I addressed myself to the basic problems we face in the Nation--number one, to whip inflation; number two, to keep our economy strong and growing; and number three, to enlist every one of you as well as 213 million other Americans in this effort which involves saving not only our economy through prudent use of our funds, through the prudent use of our energy but through the efforts of every one of you in wasting less and saving more.', 'Now let me speak, if I might, as to how you can participate and cooperate. You see on my lapel here a button that says W-I-N, WIN. It means ""Whip Inflation Now.""', 'So far, in the White House we have received over 100,000 communications from citizens all over this great country--rich, poor, old, young--individuals who understand that it is essential, it is vital, that if we are to preserve our way of life, our economy, our Government, that we have to enlist in this battle, a battle to save America.', 'And so I urge every one of you here to write the White House, and we will send you a WIN button which indicates that you have pledged yourself and that you will get others to join in this struggle which is crucial to the future of our great country.', 'Now in this program that I submitted to the Congress about 10 days ago, there were 31 different proposals. It was a comprehensive program aimed at winning the battle against inflation, keeping our economy strong and constructive and moving forward. It was a plan and a program to conserve energy and to develop our natural resources so we would have more supplies and not be in a practical problem of allocating shortages.', 'Now the Congress has a responsibility to move on that program, and one of the ingredients of that program was to ask the Congress to set a ceiling of $300 billion on Federal spending which would amount to about a $5.4 billion saving.', 'I regret to tell you that the Congress has not sent to my desk this spending limitation.', 'Now what we need in Congress are candidates who will cut redtape, who will cut the budget, and, in effect, cut the mustard. And I urge you to make sure that the ones you elect this fall meet those criteria.', 'Now, let me say a word or two, if I might, about some of the gentlemen that have appeared here, others you will see between now and November 5. I indicated at the outset that I am proud of the candidates that the Republican Party have fielded in the State of South Carolina. They are good people. They are seeking to give to you and South Carolina competition.', 'A long time ago I competed in college athletics, and I found there that competition was good for everybody. Later, I practiced law, and I found that competition in the legal field was good. I have been in the Congress, or I was in the Congress, for almost 26 years. I found that competition in Congress was good for America. Competition is one of the basic ingredients of the American system.', 'Competition is good for everybody. And so I am proud to be here and to say that in Jim Edwards, Carroll Campbell,2 you have good candidates for the two highest State offices in South Carolina.', '2 State Senator James B. Edwards was the Republican candidate for Governor of South Carolina, and State Representative Carroll A. Campbell Jr., was the Republican candidate for Lieutenant Governor.', 'They are the kind that believe in reform. They have experience in State government. And I think all of you would be proud to support their candidacy.', 'But I am also delighted to be in South Carolina to speak up with pride for Gwen Bush, Marshall Parker, Len Phillips, Bob Watkins.3 These are candidates who come from you, the people of South Carolina, who want to represent you.', '3 Republican candidates for United States Senator and for Congress from the Third, Fifth, and Fourth Districts of South Carolina, respectively.', 'And it seems to me that it is important in South Carolina, as it is in every one of the other 49 States, that we develop this competition, a strong two-party system, that will give to all of you in this great State an opportunity to make a choice.', 'And as I said a moment ago, I am proud of the people that my party has fielded to give you that choice.', 'I happen to know Floyd Spence and Ed Young from your State who served with me in the House of Representatives--fine, fine Members of Congress. They represent your State with the kind of forward-looking attitude, the kind of voting record, that is good for your State and good for our Nation.', 'And of course, it has been my privilege over a long period of time to know your great Senator, Strom Thurmond, who has the same point of view, the same strength.', 'So, let me just say that in Strom Thurmond, Ed Young, Floyd Spence, we have given you the kind of people that I think are good for your State, a. re good for our country. And I hope and trust, as you meditate and contemplate between now and November 5, you will feel, as I do, the pride in the kind of candidates that are represented by the party that is headed by Strom Thurmond in the great State of South Carolina.', 'Thank you very, very much.']"
5,Gerald R. Ford ,"October 22, 1974","['Thank you very, very much, Senator Henry Bellmon. Thank you, Dewey Bartlett, Happy Camp. Thank all of you for being here.', 'It is a great, great opportunity for me to meet many, many of you again and to see so many enthusiastic, vigorous individuals--Republicans, Democrats, and Independents--who want to make sure that Henry Bellmon is reelected.', 'It should be obvious to you that it is a great pleasure for me to be back in Oklahoma again, the home of Will Rogers, who never met a man he didn\'t like, and the home of the Oklahoma Sooners, a team who never met a team they couldn\'t lick. Yes, it is great to be here in ""Switzer Land"" 1 again.', 'As an old football player, and I mean old--when I played it was back when the ball was round--it is nice to see Ron Shotts here and Rod Shoate.2 It is wonderful to see one of those great all-American running backs. As a former lineman myself, I have always envied--as I am sure Rod does over here--those men in the backfield who seem to get a little more publicity than some of us linemen.', 'I never regretted their achievements. We always thought we helped a bit. But let me say this. I was once introduced at a dinner given at the University of Michigan. I was introduced by an old teammate from the University, and I will never forget his introduction.', 'He happened to say in the course of that introduction, ""It might interest you to know that I played football with Jerry Ford for 2 years, and it made a lasting impression on me. I was a quarterback, Jerry Ford was the center. And you might say it gave me a completely different view of the President."" [Laughter]', 'Let me comment, if I might, on some views and perceptions of the coming election. I am convinced that a campaign can come from behind and win, and you are going to do it in Oklahoma.', 'I am totally convinced that this State has energy, not only in its oil fields, on its football fields, but also in the open-minded spirit of its population, including Democrats and Independents as well as Republicans.', 'Oklahoma, as a State, has produced a great winning football team, and it is going to produce a great winning Republican team this fall.', 'I am deeply honored to be introduced by one of the most independent men in the United States Senate, and I refer to your distinguished Senator, Henry Bellmon, who is so highly regarded in Washington--and I say this with some authority and great respect. He is respected by both Democrats as well as Republicans. I have heard that Henry Bellmon is the only honest-to-goodness dirt farmer in the United States Senate. He calls the shots as he sees them.', 'And a person with that strength of independence obviously, on some occasions, will differ with me, but I respect that independence of thought, that independence of action, as well as his total dedication to honesty and candor and forthrightness serving in the United States Senate. You must reelect Henry Bellmon.', 'In the 25-plus years that I served in the House of Representatives I found that it takes some courage to make unpopular decisions. It takes some courage to be your own man. And I say with the depth of my conviction that I respect individuals who have those qualities.', 'Henry, because of his background, is a top authority on agriculture and the expansion of food production. He is, therefore, a person of utmost importance in our battle against inflation.', 'In addition, Henry is sought on both sides of the political aisle for his knowledge about oil and energy. And I am glad to know that Henry Bellmon is energetically seeking a vast new nuclear development park through the Atomic Energy Commission near Muskogee, and I commend and congratulate you, Henry, for that effort.', ""A man who served 4 years in the statehouse as Governor, a man who has served almost 6 years as the United States Senator does not have to prove his devotion to the people of Oklahoma. It is obvious that he has their best interests at heart, and as a team, he and Senator Dewey Bartlett represent, in my judgment, Oklahoma's finest, especially in the areas of food and energy, the State's leading industries. And both of them are vitally important to us in the other 49 States."", ""Since all but one of Oklahoma's delegation, Happy Camp, are Democrats, a balance is provided by keeping these two Republican Senators in the Senate delegation. But Happy needs some help in the House, and we have some good Republican candidates on the ticket in other districts."", 'In the First District, George Mizer, Jr., of Oklahoma Cherokee heritage, is a forthright, courageous man. A former U.S. Navy pilot, he has shown brilliance in management as well as in business. He has acquired a reputation of integrity, and he has accumulated considerable political experience. I think you and Oklahoma need George in Washington.', 'In the Second District, Ralph Keen is an excellent candidate. Ralph is a distinguished attorney. He has served as general business manager of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma. He is the kind of a man who will represent all the people of this great State, regardless of political labels or background. You need Ralph in Washington.', 'In the Fifth District, Marvin ""Mickey"" Edwards, an outstanding newspaperman, is your candidate. He served in the national leadership of the Young Republicans, as a member of the State Republican executive committee, and as a delegate to the 1972 GOP National Convention. Mickey needs your help.', 'And now, if I might say just a word about my former colleague and dear friend, Happy Camp. Six years ago I visited Enid, Oklahoma, to campaign for Happy as a new candidate for the House of Representatives. All the promises that were made to me that Happy would be an excellent Member of the House, all those promises were kept by his performance. It would certainly make me happy to see Happy back in the House of Representatives, and I think it would make you happy, too.', 'Traveling around the country, as I am pleased and honored to do--as a matter of fact, for several years I traveled about 200,000 miles a year--I had the opportunity of meeting many Governors of various States, Democrats and Republicans, and you learn after a period of time to look at their records to see them. I can say, after having met Jim Inhofe, that your candidate for Governor is a first-class candidate. I hope he is elected.', ""But now, let's talk about 1974, not 1976. This is the year of decision, as I see it, for the survival of the two-party system in our great country. It is a year when we seek to enlist a new Congress in the war against inflation. It is a year in which I strongly appeal to all voters--Democratic, Republican, and Independent--to elect candidates who will fight against inflation."", 'Henry Bellmon has a reputation not only in Oklahoma but in Washington as a tightfisted man with your tax dollars. He has been a general in the war against wasteful Federal spending. He has been against top-heavy bureaucratic dictatorship in Washington. He has been against legislative dictatorship by those who would wreck the budget and waste our dollars on far-out schemes and programs. I think you need--we do, I do-Henry Bellmon to continue as the man in his command post in the coming attack against the Federal Treasury.', 'You need the other Republican candidates who are here today to help Henry and Dewey Bartlett and Happy Camp. You can expand your Oklahoma delegation of inflation fighters.', 'Now, let me ask you this very simple question: Why do I, as your President, call for the election of more fighters in the war against inflation? If the Democrats, for example, gain 7 Senate seats on November 5, and 25 or more House seats on that day, they will make, in effect, the Congress veto-proof.', 'Such a Congress, unrestrained by any veto powers of the President, could resurrect those wild spending programs of the years of 1965 and 1966. Refresh your memory, if you will. The election of these additional extremists in the Democratic Party--and they would come from that element--could threaten the internal balance of our legislative process.', 'In my judgment, this would endanger our basic concept of government in America, the system of checks and balances. I have found in my time in the Congress of the United States that one of the greatest protections we all have-it is not a part of the Constitution as such, but it has grown up with our political history--I have found that a two-party system is good for America in every State, in all 50 States. And I am deeply concerned that this system of checks and balances, through a two-party system, faces its greatest threat in our lifetime on November 5.', 'I ask all voters across the political spectrum--Democrat, Independent, and Republican--to think as inflation fighters and not along strictly partisan political lines.', 'The record ought to be reviewed, and let me take just a minute, if I might. The Democrats have controlled the national legislature, our Congress in Washington, for 38 out of the last 42 years. The last 20 years they have controlled it consecutively. Fiscal responsibility has not been in this instance, for this span of time, honored except in words--they certainly have not honored it in votes.', ""During this period of time, unfortunately, Pandora's box of inflation has been opened. Today's Congress is stacked, in my judgment, against fiscal responsibility."", 'Let me cite another thing here that ought to awaken our concern, our interest. For 19 out of the 25-plus years that I served in the House, we ended up with deficits in the Federal Treasury. Nineteen out of 25 years, your Federal Government spent more money than it took in. Twenty-three of the 25-plus years that I served in the House, the Democrats controlled the Congress. I think these statistics, these facts illustrate who has been responsible for the irresponsible spending of your tax dollars.', 'Now, if this heavy spending majority in the Congress of the United States is substantially increased in the next Congress, the two-party system will be in jeopardy. We must not permit a legislative dictatorship. We must elect an inflation-proof Congress and not a veto-proof Congress.', 'It is essential to every working man, every housewife, every citizen that we have a Congress in the great tradition of our political history, a Congress that respects the common sense of checks and balances, the common sense of protecting your pocketbook and your job. From my experience, a veto-proof Congress for 1975 and 1976 could literally run the country through a lopsided power over legislation and spending. It could mean a Congress so deficient, so lacking in internal balance through a huge influx of a group of freshmen Democrats-unfortunately, the probability is they would be the most liberal spenders, more liberal in spending your tax dollars than even those who have been there--that a mandate for more spending will be what many will read on November 5.', 'Let me refresh your memory just a moment, if I might. Think back to what happened in 1964. The Democrats gained 38 House seats giving them a total of 295 to 140 on our side of the aisle. For 2 years, unsound legislation was pushed through the Congress by a vigorous President and a rubber-stamp House and Senate. Interest rates climbed; the value of the dollar began to decline.', 'We have been trying ever since to repair that damage. We have recovered some ground in 1966. The American people saw the mistake they made in 1964. There was a net gain of 47 Republicans in the House. To this extent, this righted that imbalance. We prevented, as a consequence, the unsound legislation being further pushed, and we, to some extent, recaptured and held the lid.', 'But let me say this as I look at the past: The Republican Party is resilient, it is strong--because of the sound principles that I have learned in my time in political life--it is in the great tradition of our great country. We have good people, good candidates. And we as a party have the capability and the ability to come back to start from your own 2-yard line and score on November 5.', 'The man- and womanpower in this audience here today, if you will rally around the great candidates that you have, if you explain the true legislative issues and the differences between one candidate and another, the difference between an inflation fighter and an inflationary spender, I am sure that your friends and your fellow Oklahomans will understand and make the right decision November 5.', 'I must repeat a point with great emphasis: A veto-proof Congress could roadblock vital legislation, including measures that I have recommended to increase energy on the one hand and stifle and handicap the anti-inflation proposals that I have made on the other. A veto-proof Congress would undermine the philosophy of revenue sharing which gives to local people far more control in the use of their tax dollars. A veto-proof Congress would mean a flow of power away from the local communities. A veto-proof Congress would mean the concentration of power again in Washington, D.C.', 'I think most of us in this audience agree that you get wiser spending, better spending, if your locally elected officials, if your State officials have the power. We can do infinitely better in solving the problems if you can keep your eye on those people right here locally. You can do it far better, and your money will be infinitely better spent than if you have to go 1,200, 1,500 miles to Washington to see what is being done.', 'I think, with the efforts that you can make, you can retain that power at home and keep it from the bureaucrats in Washington.', 'I am not a peddler of despair. I happen to believe that games can be won, political elections can be won with a massive effort and determination. We must correct what is wrong, strengthen what is right, and move forward rather than backward.', 'I think this will help to solve the problems at the local, the State, and the national level.', ""I don't know of a State in the Union that I have found that has more belief in and dedication to the free enterprise system, to individual initiative, and Oklahoma is the leader in making certain and positive that our country continues to have the adherence and the belief in, the conviction in free enterprise and individual freedom. And I think the people in this audience, whether they are Democratic or Republican or Independent, share that view."", 'As a result, if we do what we should between now and November 5, we can continue to move forward as a great nation. We can reduce Federal spending. We can whip inflation. We will open a new era of achievement in State and local governments. The body politic and the economic condition and resources of America can be strengthened.', 'We have in our heart and our minds in some 213 million Americans the capability of continuing to be a leader in the world. We are entering the final stretch. It is like the last few minutes of a ball game. We are in the final days of a great political campaign, convinced that we have the right philosophy, the best candidates, and a good organization.', 'I am not downhearted about the fate of the Republican Party in Oklahoma or elsewhere, and I am far from downhearted about the prospects for our great country. As I travel around--and I am delighted that I am here because of the enthusiasm--I see nothing but strength and optimism and dedication and conviction on the part of our Americans everywhere I go.', 'Now if I might, let me conclude with one final observation. We have to whip inflation now, we have to strengthen our economy, and we must have peace abroad.', 'When I came to the Congress on January 3, 1949, we had a Democratic President--I think a good one--Harry Truman. We had a Republican Congress for the 2 previous years. Recall, if you will, that this was right after World War II, a war that involved some 16 million Americans on a global basis, and there was the feeling in our country and a bipartisan attitude that if Democrats and Republicans joined together, we could lay the foundation for peace on a global basis.', 'This bipartisanship--a Democratic President and a Republican Congress-did lay the foundation. We helped to rebuild; we strengthened our relations on a global basis. And as a result, I think there has been great progress in meeting the challenges from enemies as well as friends.', 'I am concerned about the breach of this bipartisanship between a Republican President and a Democratic Congress. But I hasten to add, a very good friend of mine, a good and fine Oklahoman--the Speaker of the House, Carl Albert of Bug Tussle, Oklahoma--understands that there has to be a working relationship, a unity, a bipartisanship in foreign policy. But unfortunately, this Congress, dominated by the opposition, does not seem to understand it.', ""I am concerned that if we get a Congress that is veto-proof, a Congress that has the wrong philosophy--both domestically and internationally--the possibility for the next 2 years when our country faces the challenges in the Middle East, the challenges in the Mediterranean, the challenges in the Caribbean and Latin America, the challenges in the Pacific--as we try to work to broaden detente, as we try to continue the normalization of relations with the People's Republic of China, as we in the White House and those in the Congress who understand bipartisanship and who believe that partisanship should end at the water's edge--if we get the wrong kind of Congress, peace could be in jeopardy."", 'So, I end my remarks here today by pleading with you to give to America-not to me--a Congress that will be farsighted, visionary, imaginative, cooperative, so that we can have peace abroad, so we can work on our problems at home.', 'I thank you for the welcome. I urge you to send back Henry Bellmon, Happy Camp, and a good slate of Republicans.', 'Thank you very much.']"
6,Gerald R. Ford ,"October 24, 1974","['Governor Bob Ray, Lieutenant Governor Neu, my former colleagues in the House, Bill Scherle, Wiley Mayne, and I guess H. R. Gross is here someplace:', 'Let me say it has been a wonderful visit to Des Moines already--the crowds on the highway, the tremendous group here, the enthusiasm, the warm welcome. I can only say, from a Michigander to a Hawkeye, thank you very, very much.', 'On some occasions, Governor Ray, I have thought that having Iowa still a part of Michigan would be extremely helpful to us in Michigan, but I would be in a real tough spot now if Michigan and Iowa were somehow joined. We have got a great, good Governor in Bill Milliken, and you have a great, good Governor in Bob Ray. It would be real tough to decide.', ""I know one contribution that was made by Michigan to Iowa a few years ago. As you know, I played football at the University of Michigan a long time ago, back when the ball was round. But in later years, one of our great Michigan stars came to the University of Iowa--Forrest Evashevski--who did a great job out here. And I have often wondered why we didn't keep him at Michigan, because he was such a great competitor, a great football coach, and a great contribution to our State."", 'Let me just say from my observations that the weather, the people, the candidates, the Governor--you have a great State, and I think all of you should be very proud of it.', 'During the 25 years that I was in the Congress, I will say without any hesitation or qualification that I have always been impressed with the men, frankly, from both parties that were sent to the Congress of the United States.', 'They have been strong men, independent individuals, men of integrity, men of action--like your Governor, Bob Ray. I happen to believe that he has provided the sort of independence and the leadership that we have come to expect from Hawkeyes in whatever office they serve, and I congratulate you for the three terms that Governor Ray has already had, and I urge you from the bottom of my heart to make sure that he is your first Governor elected for a 4-year term.', 'I think that you have in this great State something that the rest of us could well use. Iowa is solvent. You have a long history of stable government, particularly under Bob Ray. You even have a balanced budget, which is progress by any standard. I have to admit that I was bit startled when the Governor told me that the budget was not only balanced but had substantial surplus of something like $200 million. I was startled because it has been years and years and years since I have heard of a surplus back in Washington in the Federal Treasury.', 'Yes, these are open spaces out here in Iowa, which give all of you room to move, to bring up your children. I think you have achieved in this great State that urban-rural balance that is the envy of every State in the Union.', ""I was most impressed with the figures that your Governor cited on stemming migration out of Iowa for the first time since the 1890's. I am told people are no longer pouring out of Iowa. They are no longer pouring off the farms, leaving the State, and this is a pattern that I hope we can develop--that we can develop not only in a few States but all States; a pattern that we can develop across the Nation."", 'The problems that we have been experiencing with our economy since the end of the involvement in Vietnam--including shortages, including scarcities-have brought home, it is my judgment, some of the basic lessons that our people have to remember, have to recall, and have to build on. It is my judgment that we have to simplify our lifestyles. We must return to some of the basics. We must make the best use of what we have. We must cut out the waste. We must strip away the nonessentials. In short, we have to return to the state of mind and the way of life that made us the greatest nation in the history of mankind.', 'If we will sit back and look, reflect just a bit, we can see ourselves as part of a community with people directly influencing things that shape their individual lives. If you take this time to reflect, I think you will find that people--yourself and others--can determine their own priorities, and that sense of community has not been lost here in Iowa.', 'In the coming years, we will continue to see Iowa, under the leadership of Bob Ray, serving as a model for the rest of the Nation. You have in this great State what so many people all over the United States are seeking. You have the basic values upon which America was built over a period of some 200 years. I personally think of Iowa when I think of stability, of progress, and just as importantly, balance. I like the balance that you are achieving in Iowa between industry and agriculture.', 'Some of my advisers in Washington have suggested that I should avoid the subject of agriculture here today. They said our Iowa farmers and farmers throughout the Midwest are especially frustrated this year. I certainly and very deeply share the concern of farmers whose corn and soybean crops were stunted by drought and destroyed by early frosts.', ""The trend, however, for urbanization during the past few decades resulted in the downplaying of the farmer's central role in America's society. But recent problems have refocused our national attention on the farmer as one of our greatest national assets--an asset we should be proud of. It is my judgment that this is the time that we should be expanding farming in America. Let us encourage our young people to remain on the farms and others to return to them."", 'Iowa, your great State, for obvious reasons, is aware of the importance of agriculture, not only to your State but to our Nation and to the world. It is absolutely essential to the well-being of our total society here as well as around the world.', 'America can no longer expect the farmer to sacrifice so that others can live well. All Americans now realize that we are all in this problem together, and the farmer should not be called upon to make an extra sacrifice. It must be shared by all.', ""We rely upon the farmer for the strength of the community. The American farmer can outplant, outgrow, and outmarket any farmer--I don't care what nation in the world. However, if the farmer gets a fair shake, the American farmer can not only feed the people of the United States but human beings all over the world. And this in itself is something that we should appreciate and be grateful for."", 'In the immediate years ahead, American agriculture will be our greatest asset in the world trade market. In the last 2 or 3 years, the availability of the production of the American farmer has been extremely helpful as we try to help those who are less well-off than ourselves, for good humanitarian reasons.', 'As we try to use our food that is produced on the farms in America for reasons to benefit the United States, we should be so thankful that we are blessed with the land and the farms of America.', ""Food is, as we know, a basic key to world peace, and we in America hold that key. As I said in my speech last month to the United Nations General Assembly, the United States recognizes the special responsibility that we bear as the world's largest producer of food. We recognize that responsibility and I think we will accept it. I know it as a matter of fact, because of the people I see here in Iowa today, especially these attractive, enthusiastic, young people in the front of the audience--the cream of Iowa's bountiful crop."", ""This group of some 600--as I said, the cream of Iowa's bountiful crop--are delegates to the United Nations Youth Conference Day. I commend Iowa for its emphasis on the United Nations Day, and I thank all. of you young people for participating."", 'Yes, the decisions they make as citizens of this great food-producing State will directly affect the well-being of the citizens of the world--I know that everybody in Iowa is very proud of each and every one of you--and the understanding that they are individually developing of the world situation will serve us all well in the future.', 'I am convinced that the future is now, right here in Iowa, and I pledge to you today--and especially to all of you young people, whether you are in this group or any other group--that I will do everything in my power to make sure that the American farmer is fully rewarded for his services rendered. America owes that to the American farmer, and so does the world.', 'If I might, let me stress this point, and I speak to you on this point not as a political partisan but as a partisan of the American system of government. Our system rests not only on the balance of urban and rural America but also on the balance within our Federal Government.', 'The basic principle underlying our system is balance, a finely tuned balance, the timely balance conceived by the Founding Fathers some 200 years ago among three branches of Government--the delicate balance within the Congress and the country through the two-party system.', ""This year the polls are telling us that our delicately balanced, two-party system is in some trouble, some jeopardy. If one party upsets that balance because members of the other party are apathetic, not concerned, and as a consequence, won't get out and vote, then we stand guilty, as I see it, of abusing the American electoral process and forfeiting our hope for an effective Government. Therefore, with deep conviction I urge you to keep this very great, balanced system intact. Let's not lose an integral, important, essential part of our Government by default."", 'What concerns me very greatly is the inclination of the American people to consider politics something they would rather not become involved in, which is something in the minds of too many. As a matter of fact, the sad fact is that less than one American out of 30 has anything to do with politics, with the selection of candidates, the working in a campaign, researching issues, with raising contributions for the election of a candidate, or even running for office. It is almost unbelievable that only one American out of 30 has any connection, direct or indirect, with politics.', 'It is my considered judgment that what this Nation needs less than 2 years from the 200th year of our founding, on the 200th birthday of this Nation, is more, not less participation by the citizenry in politics.', 'To those who say that politics is a dirty word which should be eliminated from government, let me respectfully remind each and every one of you that politics is government. Politics is government--government in action.', 'There is nothing wrong with the political system of ours that a massive injection of citizen involvement will not cure. You never win a football game by sitting on the sidelines. You never do well in your business, your profession, on your farm, by doing nothing, and it is precisely the same thing in politics at the local, the State, or the Federal level. If you want to make a contribution, if you wish to be a participant, get off the sidelines and into the ball game.', 'I have spent a quarter of a century on Capitol Hill as a Member of the House of Representatives, and I happen to believe that it is important to get out and away from Washington on occasions such as this. I know there are some so-called experts who suggest that your President ought to sit in the Oval Office and listen to nothing but bureaucrats telling him what to do, yes or no, or sitting in the Oval Office reading documents that are prepared by people in Washington. I reject that advice. It is more important that I come to Des Moines.', 'This can be a two-way street. I want to discuss with you my policies and my programs, and in turn, I beg for a reaction and recommendations from all of you as to whether we are doing things right or wrong. And if we are doing them wrong, tell us how we can do them better. We solicit your participation. That is one reason I am here in Des Moines. I believe that it is vital that this two-way communication exists.', ""May I conclude with one other observation. I am told by the political forecasters that in this election year, 1974, there will be less people, a lesser number of eligible voters throughout the country voting on November 5 than at any time in any off-year election for the last 20 or more years. I don't believe that is going to happen. You won't, through apathy, let a minority make a decision for the majority. I only hope that instead of the 42 percent that they are forecasting who will actually vote, that it will be 50 or 60 percent--so that we get a true reflection of what people want done; so the majority makes a decision, not the minority making a determination."", 'Yes, Congressional, State, and local elections are what it is all about. I say as strongly and as sincerely as I can, there is no weapon so mighty, no force so powerful as the silent vote in the privacy of the voting booth.', 'It is the duty as well as the opportunity of every eligible voter in Iowa and the other 49 States to balance the ledger sheet on good government.', 'So, I say to all this wonderful group of Iowa friends, get out this time, vote as you have never voted before. The future of our American political system depends on your participation. It does in 1974, and it will in the years to come.', 'Thank you very, very much.']"

Ford ,"October 29, 1974","['Thanks, Bill Farr, Bob VanderLaan, Milt Zaagman, Pete, Marty, all of the other candidates at the State and local level, all of you who in all honesty overwhelm me as they did down at the Vandenberg plaza:', 'I have been in a good many States in recent weeks, and I am going to a couple more the latter part of this week and the first of next. And let me say that this is beyond--above and beyond the call of duty. I thank you. It is just wonderful to be here. I am deeply indebted to each and every one of you.', 'You know Bill Spoelhof, the great president of Calvin College. Bill and I started out as precinct workers together a long time ago. I was always scared to death that he would be a candidate for Congress. [Applause] Thank goodness he did not, after that reaction.', 'But Bill, I want to thank you for always making the Calvin facilities available. I have been here a number of times. As you know, I have always had a warm welcome, and this crowd tonight reminds me of a good Calvin-Hope basketball contest. Since I did not go to either one, I could be completely objective, pulling for both.', 'But I did see something that was on the chair as I sat down. It has been sort of a tradition of my campaign to put out these hot pads, or whatever they call them. And they were always gobbled up by thoughtful women who wanted to be reminded what a good Congressman would do. And we always used to put on those hot pads, ""Vote for some Congressman by the name of Ford who works for you in Congress."" That is what we emphasized--work for you in Congress. And that is what Paul Goebel will do for you. He will work for you in Congress.', 'Well, I can see, as I look around this great crowd, some wonderful people from Ionia, from Montcalm, from Barry, from Eaton, from Clinton, as well as from Kent County. I love you, and it is just great to see you all.', 'Naturally, I am delighted to be back home. I just wish Betty were here. But she did ask me to extend to you, one and all, her gratitude for the many prayers, many thoughtful messages--all of which have been extremely helpful to her and to us during this difficult period.', 'I thank you very much on her behalf.', 'I think all these wonderful balloons--she is the best part of the family; I have always said that--but I got a big kick out of watching all these balloons come down from the ceiling at the start of the program. You might say this is the big difference between our position on our side of the aisle and their position on the other side of the aisle. We put hot air in the balloons, and they put it in their speeches. [Laughter]', 'You know, a few weeks ago the Ohio State University was thoughtful enough to ask me to--I said they were thoughtful enough to invite me to come and give a commencement address. And gee, they could not have been nicer. But it does create a bit of a problem with this contest coming up in a couple of weeks between the Buckeyes and the Wolverines. I try to be nonpartisan as I go from one State to another, but it is particularly difficult to be nonpartisan when it comes to such basic matters as football.', 'Now, take this game between Ohio and Michigan in a couple of weeks. People keep asking me who I will be rooting for. Well, I think the late President Kennedy had a real good answer. He handled the problem extremely well. He was in Iowa, just before their big game with Notre Dame. And someone asked him the very same question, ""Who will you be rooting for, Mr. President?""', 'And Jack Kennedy said, ""I will be rooting for Iowa.""', 'And then he added, after a tremendous cheer went up, ""But I will be praying for Notre Dame."" [Laughter]', 'So, come the Michigan-Ohio game, I will let you figure out who I will be rooting for and who I will be praying for.', 'Now, every 2 years for the last 25, for 13 campaigns, I have come back to our Congressional district seeking your support and gratefully receiving it. I have never been disappointed. I have always been most appreciative.', 'I guess it is kind of a habit to come back, and on the 14th it just seemed to me, even if I could come back for just one day, it would be like coming home. Now, it does not mean I can go from Kent to Ionia to Montcalm to Eaton to Clinton to Barry Counties.', 'That would be quite a bit in the limited time available, but whether I am in all six counties or not, my heart, my soul, my conviction, my dedication is there for the purpose of electing Paul Goebel to Congress from the Fifth Congressional District.', 'I thought it was very wonderful for the Governor to come to Grand Rapids today to participate in our ceremonies down at Vandenberg Center and to thoughtfully introduce me.', 'I have known Bill Milliken for a long time. I knew him when he was a State senator. I knew him in his other responsibilities, and I watched him very carefully and extremely closely as Governor of our great State. And in the process, over the last month, I have had the opportunity of looking--and I say this to anybody who has any doubt whatsoever--I have had the privilege of looking at Governors from many States--Democrats, Republicans--and Bill Milliken by any standard--and I say this as strongly, as vigorously as I can--Bill Milliken by any standard is at the very top, and I hope he is reelected.', 'I guess I am prejudiced, but for good reasons. If Bill Milliken is going to do the job that he is expected to do as Governor of our great State, then Bill needs support in the State legislature.', 'You know the ones that have served you well, the ones who are seeking to serve you well. And I just hope that Bill gets the team that he deserves to do the best job for the great Wolverine State. Do your best, if you possibly can, for this great group of State legislative candidates.', 'You know, I have gotten a lot of advice lately from friends and foes and neutral observers. They said, ""Mr. President, you ought to stay in Washington, surround yourself with that beautiful atmosphere at the White House, spend some time with your new dog, Liberty, and cogitate over these great decisions that are presented to you, and then let the voters out in the respective areas of this country make up their own minds.""', 'Well, I respectfully disagree with that view. I happen to believe that a President of the United States who has conviction and dedication ought to go out and talk to the people and listen to them instead of sitting in the Oval Office at the time of a great campaign.', 'It is my deep belief, it is my honest conviction that we are doing right, both at home and abroad. We have some tough hurdles to cover, but as you look across the spectrum internationally or domestically and compare the role of our country with other countries, the problems of our country with other countries, the United States is doing well, and we should be darned proud to be Americans and to participate in our society.', 'In the last 3 months since I became President, I have traveled almost 17,000 miles, met literally hundreds and thousands of citizens in many, many States, and I think it is the most refreshing, the most helpful experience, because there are, literally, unbelievably great numbers of wonderful people who have some thoughts and ideas and suggestions and contributions to make.', 'I think their help and assistance is just as vital as what I can get sitting in the White House looking at a lot of memorandums and papers that come from a fine staff or come from others.', 'This group here has got the power, the genius, the drive, the help, and I am darned fortunate to be here and to see you all and to get the message that you are giving me, which is the message that you gave me in 13 previous elections-integrity, dedication, work, objectivity, and a love for America as much as you have it, and I hope I do, and I believe I do.', 'I am here tonight for a particular purpose, but I must express my gratitude to the local officials, Jack Root of the county, Lyman Parks of the city, and their respective associates for the unbelievable reception down at the Vandenberg Center and in the Calder [Plaza] area.', 'You know, the weather was a little bad, but I think it is fair to say that they were not good weather friends. They were there because we had a rapport. And I did not ask that group because it is a nonpartisan group, but I am here to ask every one of you to help in any way you can--and this is a message from Betty as well as from me--to elect Paul Goebel on November 5 so I can have the good help that I need from the Fifth District in Washington, D.C.', 'I said a moment ago I have traveled almost 17,000 miles, 16 States. My hope is that to some extent I can be beneficial, helpful in electing a Congress that will help me in the battle we are undertaking to lick inflation and to strengthen our economy.', 'What I want is a Congress that will help me make sure--and let me emphasize this very specifically, very categorically--I want a Congress that will help me make certain and positive that your paycheck buys as much on the day you cash it as on the day that you earned it. That is our program.', 'If I know anything about the people of this district, whether you are in business or on the production line or on a farm or in the service or in a service organization, the people of this district understand the sound fundamentals of how to run a business, a church, a school, a PTA, or the Government.', 'I want to, if I might, address a few observations and comments to what I believe, and I hope you believe, is public enemy number one--inflation. With your help and with the election of a cooperative Congress, I am confident that we can whip inflation, and this button, WIN, means Whip Inflation Now. And we can with a good program, which I have submitted to the Congress, and with the cooperation of 213 million Americans, we can do it, but we need the Congress, and we need the help of all of you.', ""And as I look around here, I see a great many people who have the WIN button on them, and if you don't have one, write us, and the White House will see that you get it as long as you enlist in that army to Whip Inflation Now."", 'But let me make this observation: When I talk about a cooperative Congress, I am talking about a Congress that will be conscientious about how they handle your tax dollars.', 'In the Congress, from 25 years experience, I could pick out the big spenders and the savers, and the record clearly shows that in the Congress of the United States, the majority of the big spenders are on the Democratic side of the aisle.The majority of the savers are on our side of the aisle. It is just that simple.', 'Now, I admit there are a few crossovers on one issue, or perhaps on the overall. But I am talking to you very pragmatically, that this district has consistently had a Congressman who is in the category of a saver, not a spender. And if you want to restore that reputation, you darn well better vote for Paul Goebel in the next election.', 'Now, I have been reading newspapers and listening to some of the commentators recently, and I have noticed that everybody is predicting the worst possible results from the Republican point of view. They say we are going to be clobbered, we are going to be wiped out, there is going to be a catastrophic defeat for the Republican Party, we are going to have a terrible time in this election.', ""Well, I respect those who want to vote for a legislative dictatorship. I don't agree with it, because the balance in our Government is predicated on what our forefathers wrote in the Constitution and what we have adopted by practice over the last 200 years, of a balance between the executive, the legislative, and the judicial branches, so that no part of our Government, no individual could control the destinies, the fate of people in this great land."", 'And this system of checks and balances, this finely tuned system of balance between our three coordinate branches of Government has given us more freedom, more opportunity, and more blessings than any people in the history of mankind. And we have got to keep that balance.', 'But you can destroy that balance. You can destroy that balance if the opposition were to gain a net of 50 in the House or 7 or 8 in the Senate. It would put a stranglehold on the legislative process, because it would mean the inevitable election of those of the most liberal persuasion in the Democratic Party.', 'I am not condemning all Democrats, because some of them have been extremely helpful, and particularly the Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate. But their troops run wild. They are like a commander who tells them to do what is right, and then they scatter all over the ballpark.', 'And so, what I am saying to you is what we really need is competition in the Congress, not an overwhelming majority in the ranks of one political party, because if you get that kind of 2-to-4 , 3-to-4, 4-to-1 strength in one political party, inevitably you have this legislative dictatorship which destroys that very fundamental concept that has made it so great for all of us in America, a balance.', 'So, a veto-proof Congress is not what we want. I have got a better idea, this forecast: We want an inflation-proof Congress, not a veto-proof Congress. And Paul Goebel will give us that result.', 'Now, if you get a veto-proof Congress, if you get a legislative dictatorship, as I have indicated, the whole system of checks and balances go out the window.', 'Now, some of my good Democratic friends have a different idea of checks and balances--a little different from mine. They write the checks even though there are never any balances.', 'And from your own personal experience, you know where that could lead. But let me make this observation, if I can. I am told that there is a great degree of apathy in America, and yet when I go to Sioux Fails, South Dakota, they had 10,000 in an auditorium like this and 5,000 people who could not get in. When I went to Lincoln, Nebraska, they had 5,000 or 6,000 at an airport rally. We have been to other communities where the crowds have been good. We have had a few disappointments, but we have had good reception.', 'Tonight is the best, and I thank you for it.', 'But do you realize that all of you here tonight can directly affect this election come November 5? You have it within your own grasp. You have it by your own vote and how you can persuade, how you can help, by just what this group does here tonight.', ""On the other hand, if some of you sit it out, this election can be lost. I do not think you are going to be the kind of a villain who won't participate."", ""I don't think you are going to be apathetic or you would not be here tonight, but there are many of your neighbors and your friends who, according to the statisticians, are not going to participate."", 'Let me give you something that is terribly disturbing--it ought to scare you as it does me. Take the national percentage of votes cast in the Congressional off-year elections, like the one that is coming up next week: Based on a total number of eligible voters, only 46.3 percent cast their ballots in 1962, only 45.6 percent took the time to do so in 1966, and the percentage of eligibles who voted in the last off-year election, 1970, was even lower--43.8.', 'Now, in this last special election that was held in February, about 35 percent in this district went to the polls. According to the statisticians, the computer projection, only 42 percent of your fellow Americans are going to vote in this election in all 50 States on November 5.', 'I made a speech earlier this week at the Arlington Cemetery. I made a speech there because it was Veterans Day. We were paying tribute to and memorializing the hundreds and hundreds who have been buried in that wonderful cemetery. It gave me an inspiration to say to you that if they could give their lives to give you the right to vote, you ought to exercise that right to vote.', 'I cannot imagine an election that is more important to this district, to this State, than what will take place and transpire right here in the Fifth District next week.', ""Paul Goebel I have known since he was just a lad. His dad knew me when I was back at South High--an inspired if not very competent football player. But I have known the Goebel family a long time, and they are strong and they are tall, and they are the kind of people who are dedicated to public service. Paul, Jr.'s, father was; Paul, Jr., himself is."", 'And I have seen nothing but the finest in that family, and young Paul, he epitomizes all the great characteristics of that family.', 'And therefore, on the basis of quality as a person and experience in business and government, you have a great candidate. You have the kind of candidate that will do a job for all of you and for our State and for our country.', 'I know that he will stand up when the going is tough in the House of Representatives. And I know the trials and the tribulations that a Member of Congress goes through when he has to decide what is good and what is bad--and it is not always black or white; it is a little gray here and there.', ""But Paul has the brains and the conscience and the understanding to sift out the good from the bad and to give you a right answer. And therefore, without hesitation, reservation, or qualification, I can tell you I have already voted for Paul by absentee voter's ballot."", 'I am not going to try and vote again. Once is enough to show my support for a darned good Congressional candidate.', 'Now, let me add one final word, if I may. There are some people on the dais here who, to some extent, began politics about the same time I did or had an interest in it.', 'We are sort of--that generation that came along after World War II--most of us came back from some military service. Most of us saw the mistakes that our country made in the twenties and the thirties when we thought, mistakenly, that the Atlantic Ocean on one side and the Pacific on the other would be an adequate protection, and that we as a nation could close our eyes, close our ears, and not pay attention to the problems in the rest of the world and let them fight it out, whatever they wanted to do.', 'That was the mistake of the twenties and the thirties, and the consequence was, between Hitler and Mussolini and others, we got involved in a contest between freedom on the one hand and the effort on the part of some to subjugate people on the other.', ""Whether it was in Hitler's Germany or Mussolini's Italy or elsewhere, the issue was clear-cut, and 16 million Americans went to war in the Pacific or in the Atlantic. And you know, most of us came back convinced that this was a globe and we had to live together and work together, to find peace together, to build together, to help one another in one way or another."", 'As I said down at Calder, the one that convinced me that this approach was right--the approach of cooperation--was Arthur Vandenberg, a great Senator from our city and from our State.', ""And Arthur Vandenberg convinced me that if we were going to solve the problems of the Mediterranean, we had to support Harry Truman's program of Greek-Turkey aid; that we had to help a Democratic President even though both Senator Vandenberg and I were Republicans, by helping the rehabilitation, the reconstruction of Western Europe, including the Netherlands."", 'And he convinced me that we on the other side of the political aisle had to help a Democratic President build a sufficiently strong defense program, not for aggression, but for the maintenance of peace. So, Arthur Vandenberg was a great, great leader for our country and a great inspiration to me.', ""He taught me how to work with Democrats. He taught me the right approach as far as foreign policy was concerned. And the net result was we have had, relatively speaking, in Western Europe and many other parts of the world, a policy that was basically bipartisan--some variations, some deviations--and all of us, in my judgment, have been better off. It has led to peace in Europe. It has led to the detente that was initiated in the last 5 years. It has led to the achievements of a new approach to our relations with the People's Republic of China."", 'This bipartisanship under the leadership of our party has given to us, I think, the most solid foundation for peace over a long period of time.', 'Now, this last session of the Congress was very difficult. The Democratic leadership and the Republican leadership have worked with me, a Republican President. But unfortunately, too many of the troops have gone off in a hundred different directions.', 'And the consequence is, we have not had the support to find the proper answer to help the Greeks and Turks resolve their problems in Cyprus. There has not been the kind of support which we need to keep a sound policy in Southeast Asia. There has not been the kind of support that I think is needed to help us find the difficult key to the problems of the Middle East. And they are tough, and they are treacherous, and they are explosive.', 'Now, what I am saying is we have got some tough problems overseas, and Paul Goebel--because I know him, I have talked to him, and because I have looked at the record of his opponent--in my judgment is the best man to help me keep the peace and strengthen the peace in the months ahead. And I hope you will support him.', 'Well, it has just been wonderful to be here. I love every one of you. You have put up with me in the past. You have been kind to me when you thought I was wrong. You supported me much too often, for which I am grateful. But I hope and trust that in the months ahead, whatever I do will justify your faith, because I promise you, as I did the day I was sworn in, that I will do everything 1 can to make America strong and good, and do everything I can to make America for the best of all.', 'Thank you very, very much.']"
8,Gerald R. Ford ,"October 29, 1974","['Well, thank you very, very much, Governor Milliken, Mayor Parks, Jack Root, every one of you for being here:', 'Nobody, nobody can accuse any of you of being fair weather friends. Thank you very much.', 'But let me say somewhat inadequately, there is no way in which I can personally express my gratitude, my appreciation, my indebtedness to all of you who are here in this difficult weather to say hello, to warmly welcome me. I am just overwhelmed, and words are inadequate to express everything that I feel deep down in my heart. Thank you very, very much.', 'There was a wonderful crowd at the airport, and we stopped at one of the crowds on the way in. I just cannot believe so many are here in these circumstances, and as I shook hands, either at the airport or on the way in or with those that I have had the privilege of saying hello to here tonight, I saw friends that I went to Madison School with, friends that I went to South High with, friends that I worked with in many, many civic projects--Democrats, Independents, Republicans, young and old. There is nothing I can say except thank you, every one of you, for being here.', ""And may I thank Althea Bennett here for the box of cookies which she has given me. As was indicated, I used to stop in at Petersen's Drug Store for an early breakfast, and she was there to help prepare it, and I used to enjoy those cookies very much then, and I am sure I will now."", 'But I must tell Althea I have a big appetite. It is a long trip back to Washington. They may all be gone before Betty sees a single one.', 'Now, let me talk about why I am here. I came back to Grand Rapids because on 13 different occasions in the past, over a period of 26 years, I campaigned in the Fifth Congressional District--which originally was Ottawa and Kent Counties and is now Kent and Ionia and four other counties--because I love people, because I love the communities. And whether it was Ottawa, Kent, Ionia, Clinton, Montcalm, et cetera, I love the communities and the people.', 'And as many of you know, I have taken ""Jerry Ford\'s Main Street"" office to Byron Center, Standale, Caledonia, Alto, Rockford, Kent City, Sand Lake, Ionia, Belding, Wells, Portland, and everyplace else, and it was a great privilege for me to talk with you in the trailer.', 'It was a great privilege to go to your service club, to your farm bureau community meetings, to go to your churches, to your city hall, to meet you on the street, to go to the Lowell Showboat, the Sparta rodeo, the red flannel celebration--well, you name it, wherever you had five people I went there, because I like you. And I am back here today because I just could not stay away from this area one more time. I thank you again for the opportunities of the past.', 'As I have seen so many of you here today, and as I said a moment ago, Grand Rapids, Kent County, Ionia, Ottawa County, and the others--you are a good cross-section of America. You represent all segments of our society. We have some wonderful farms, we have some excellent businesses, we have some tremendously productive working people in this community. We have--I am prejudiced--but I think we have the best here, and all of you who are here represent the best in America.', 'As I have said to our good friend, Mayor Lyman Parks, Grand Rapids is big enough to have many of the problems of some of the major metropolitan areas. We have enough diversification in agriculture, so that I learned from firsthand experience the problems of the dairymen, the cattlemen, the applegrower, the other people that produce so that all of us can eat.', 'But the main thing that I loved about this area was we had some big city problems, but we were small enough so that you got to know people. You have got to love them. You have got to enjoy working for whatever the problem was. I do not know how many times I have walked down Cedar Springs behind about five bands in that Cedar Springs Red Flannel Parade, or how many times I have had the privilege of visiting one community or another.', 'It is a warmth, it is a friendliness, it is a look in the eye of people that makes you welcome. And the most important thing is that people in this area seem to want to work out the problems that they have, whether they are labor and management on the one hand or consumer and producer on the other.', 'I cannot help but make a comment, Lyman, about that Calder that you gave me. I was in Chicago a couple of days ago, and some of my friends over there were kidding me about Grand Rapids being a small town. And some of the commentators and writers were kidding me about, perhaps, the lack of culture in Grand Rapids. Well, I happen to think--if my memory is correct--we had a Calder in Grand Rapids before Chicago thought of it.', 'And then I have had some friends from various parts of the country tell me that, well, Grand Rapids was a little on the conservative side. Well, I cannot help but ask them in good conscience what they mean. Do they mean the people here have a healthy skepticism of quick and easy solutions? If that is a definition of conservatism, yes, we are skeptical. We are a little conservative about some of these superficial answers that some people try to sell us.', 'But if they mean that Grand Rapids and its environs are skeptical about new ideas, the answer is no. We are broad-minded; we have a good outlook. And when a new idea comes along that is constructive, that is fair to everybody, we in Grand Rapids embrace it and make it work. And that is what we have done all my lifetime.', 'Let me reminisce a moment, if I might. Some of us in the audience here can remember when the old B. F. Keith Theater was down here on Lyon Street, and some of us can remember when the Regent Theater was right over there, just where the Federal Building was, I guess, and some of the other old broken-down business places that needed to be removed and this wonderful Vandenberg Center constructed.', ""And in honor of one of Grand Rapids' outstanding citizens, in my judgment, probably the outstanding Senator that I have known in Washington, we built this Vandenberg Center in honor and in tribute to Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg."", 'And you know that Federal Building--I used to have an office right up there in the corner. I used to look down here, and I could see at various times of the day there would be periodic meetings and wonderful luncheon gatherings. Occasionally we had a demonstration or two, and sometimes in the moonlight I could look down and see a few friendly people holding hands. And what is wrong with that?', 'But the point is that this great Vandenberg Center with the Calder stabile is, in my opinion, a tribute to a great Senator. It is a tribute to a great people. It is the product of a community that had the vision and the foresight to do something for themselves in conjunction or in partnership with the Federal Government.', ""And that is the way Arthur Vandenberg believed; he was receptive to new ideas. He was a senior Senator in Washington when Betty and I first went to the Nation's Capital. He and his wonderful wife Hazel could not have been kinder, could not have been more receptive to two newcomers to the Nation's Capital. He gave me, in all honesty, the inspiration to take a look at the world as a whole. Arthur Vandenberg, some of you may recall--with former President Harry Truman--was the architect of a bipartisan foreign policy following World War II."", 'The two of them--a great Democratic President, Harry Truman, and a great Republican Senator, Senator Arthur Vandenberg--worked together hand-in-glove following World War II when the world was in devastation, when a good share of the world was on its back, and other nations--like our own--had serious problems.', 'But from those ashes, Harry Truman and Arthur Vandenberg put together a foreign policy that brought allies together, presented a common front against potential adversaries, helped underdeveloped nations grow and become a vital part of our world society. And that bipartisan foreign policy which I learned-and, fortunately, learned from one of the masters--I think, is the future of the world.', 'And we in Washington today, representing all of you--Democrats, Republicans, Independents--should march shoulder-to-shoulder to make sure that our country, our great United States of America, gives the leadership in consolidating friends and gives leadership in trying to make new contacts, broader contacts with potential adversaries. What we want to build is a world of peace so that your children and my children and their children can live in safety and security and a better world wherever they might live--Grand Rapids or elsewhere.', 'And I pledge to you, as President of the United States--and believe me, folks, my friends at home, I never thought for one minute when Betty and I left here in December of 1949, that I would be coming home to all of you as your President-but as President, I will pledge to you, as I have pledged to you in 13 previous elections, that I will do my best; I will be fair; I will be open; I will work; and I will continue the love and affection and the dedication that I have, that all of you have, for your community, for your friends, for your State, and for your Nation. This is what you can give and what I can give, and on behalf of Betty and myself, I pledge you nothing but all I can do for all of you and many like you.', 'Thank you very, very much.']"
9,Gerald R. Ford ,"October 31, 1974","['Wiley Mayne, Dave Stanley, Mayor Cole, my very good and old friend, former colleague in the House, Charlie Hoeven, all of the wonderful people from the Sixth Congressional District:', 'It is just great to be here a third time, and I thank you so much for the warm and tremendous welcome. I am deeply indebted and very, very grateful. Thank you very much.', 'A few days ago, I went to my hometown. We had a wonderful reception, but I can say without any reservation or qualification the reception here is just as enthusiastic, just as warm. And I wish to pay a special tribute to all of you who have come out on this occasion to meet me and to pay tribute to your Congressman, Wiley Mayne, and your next Senator, Dave Stanley.', 'I think it is very appropriate that we are having this rally at the airport. I have flown in today on a wing and a prayer. I ask you to send me some good men to Congress who will praise the Lord and pass the legislation.', 'It is particularly nice to be here in Sioux City, the largest community in the Sixth Congressional District in Iowa, and particularly, to pay tribute on this occasion to Wiley Mayne. You know, I have always been taught this from my early childhood--when you have a good thing going for you, you ought to keep it. And in Wiley Mayne you have that kind of a Congressman, so you darn well better keep him in the House of Representatives.', 'I served with Wiley almost 8 years in the House of Representatives. I have seen him on a day-to-day basis, working. I have seen him work in those two great committees--the House Committee on Agriculture and the House Committee on the Judiciary. And I can assure you from this very personal experience that he is a man of skill, a man of stature, a man who understands your problems, my problems, and is in a position because of his seniority to do something about it. So, I come here and speak with conviction when I urge you to see that Wiley is reelected.', 'Since we are in the heartland of American agriculture, there is no better place to commend the production, actually the production genius of the American farmer, and to say thanks to so many of you who are here and thousands upon thousands of others who are not here who have labored long and effectively in the fields of America. We thank you for a job well done.', ""At times over the past few years, farmers, in my judgment, have been unfairly criticized as the cause of high food prices. Now, as you well know, farmers are more likely--as a matter of fact, they are probably, without any doubt, the victims of inflation more than its cause. By farmer efficiency and by American agriculture's ever-increasing productivity, farmers are actually in the frontline troops, who are staving off what might well have been an even more serious round of inflation if it had not been for their efforts."", 'I am acutely aware of the problems that have beset agriculture in America and the very challenging problems that you face in the growing of your crops and the marketing of your efforts.', 'Now, some of these have been aggravated by unwise decisions by your Government. Others are the result of absolutely unusual weather problems. It was too wet in the spring, you had a drought in the summer, and you have had unseasonably early frost in the fall. And all of this, of course, complicated by the great need of additional food throughout the world.', 'Now, because of the price incentive and provisions in our agricultural legislation and because of the encouragement by Government to expand planted acreage, farmers throughout the States of this great Union have responded magnificently, superbly, to boost the supply of feed grains and soybeans.', 'Thanks to the flexibility written into the 1973 Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act, farmers were able to move relatively smoothly from a limited to a full production program. And incidentally, great credit for the major provisions of the 1973 act can and must be given to Wiley Mayne, the top ranking Republican of the important House Committee on Agriculture, Subcommittee on Livestock and Grain.', 'Let me give you a little inside or cloakroom story. While the 1973 agricultural act was being considered in committee, Wiley was being considered on the floor of the House of Representatives. I conferred very frequently with your Congressman, Wiley Mayne. I know from firsthand experience how hard he worked to help effect its enactment and to liberate farmers from the discredited, income-restrictive programs of the past 40 years.', ""So I, as a former colleague of Wiley's and one who worked with him as the Republican leader in the House, wish to express my deep gratitude and appreciation, Wiley, for the fine job that you did on this vitally important legislation."", 'I think there is another area of concern--corn and soybean production is falling short of our worldwide needs. Even so, the corn crop is, I think, the fifth largest in the history of the United States, the soybean crop is the third largest, and wheat and rice the largest ever in America.', 'We cannot, however, in fairness, ask our farmers to produce, produce more from their soil and from their labor, unless all of us are willing to share at least a part of the production risk.', 'And furthermore, there are certain things that we must do and, I will promise you, that we will do. Fuel and fertilizer, especially fertilizer, adequate to supply farm needs, continue to be a very serious problem. And as I have stated before, I will ask authorities from the Congress to assure farmers all of the fertilizer that you need for your farms. And I will make certain and positive that you will have all of the fuel that you need to do the job for all of us and consumers throughout the world.', 'And may I repeat for emphasis, I will not ask Congress to increase gasoline taxes. That is one tax that is high enough, believe me.', 'I could not come to Sioux City, the heart of the slaughter and livestock industry, particularly the cattle-feeding business, and not say a word about the production of meat. Livestock producers, particularly cattle feeders, have called to the attention of responsible officials in the Federal Government many, many times in the past year the financial wringer that they have been put through. Adjusting to higher feed costs and the increased supply of beef animals is a very painful process.', 'And so, today, despite a headline that I read in the newspaper here in Des Moines--not the one in Sioux City, but Des Moines--I will make an announcement--not one, but two, and reaffirm a third, and perhaps give you some other information concerning farming in 1974.', 'I think these announcements will relieve some of the anxiety and possibly restore some of the confidence among producers so that this great part of agriculture, which is centered in Sioux City, can become again profitable.', 'First, this Administration intends to carry out precisely the intent of the meat import law.', ""And let me be quite specific. If imports of meat, subject to the meat import law, threaten to pick up markedly during the next year, and the Agriculture Department's estimate of 1975 imports exceeds the trigger level under the meat import law, I will impose meat quotas or negotiate volunteer agreements with foreign suppliers."", 'Second, no action will be taken to change the present system of dairy import quotas, which means that dairy quotas for imports will not be increased unless and until there has been a thorough review of the overall problem and full opportunity for our dairy producers to be heard at that time.', 'There is no intention on my part to increase dairy imports into the United States.', 'Third, this Administration is not going to permit foreign dairy producers to compete against the American dairymen in the U.S. market with subsidized products. If the Europeans reinstitute their export subsidies on dairy products directed at this market, I will impose countervailing duties on their products.', 'And one final announcement, which I think rounds out a pattern of strong, effective action to help the cattle and dairy business--and let me be quite specific. In addition, I have asked the Secretary of Agriculture to investigate USDA purchases of ground beef for use in the National School Lunch Program. These purchases would provide a highly nutritious food to schools for, I think. proper use in the school lunch program.', 'Let me add this, because it is not too well understood by many. These purchases will not be an additional cost to the Government, as the USDA is obligated by law to finance each school lunch program by 10 cents, either in cash or in commodities.', 'So, this report by the Secretary of Agriculture on prospective purchases should be in my hands in a relatively short period of time, and I hope his recommendation is favorable for these purchases.', ""Now, as I have in the past--as Republican leader in the House, and as Vice President, and now as President--as I look at the problems of agriculture, I will consult with Wiley Mayne for guidance, for help in the solving of agriculture's problems."", 'I hope that I do not duplicate some of what Wiley has been telling you as he has campaigned all over the Sixth District in the northwest corner of Iowa, but I want to remind you, if I might, about the kind of service I know he has rendered to this district.', ""In a period when big corporate farms are taking over some of agriculture's production, Wiley has been in there fighting for the family farm and the family farmer."", 'Let me just quote, if I might, one precise example. Wiley has helped lead the fight in the House during the last 3 or 4 years to limit Government payments to the total of $20,000 per farm. He did so because he was in contact on a person-to-person basis with the farmers in this district who advised him that these massive payments to big farms were discrediting your total farm program.', 'That is the kind of a Congressman, in my judgment, that this district deserves; one who can listen to people, the 460-some thousand who reside in this district; one who can listen and respond to the legitimate problems, complaints, criticisms, suggestions.', 'And I might add a postscript. Dave Stanley, when he is elected to the United States Senate, will be the same kind of United States Senator that Wiley Mayne is as a Member of the House of Representatives.', 'Speaking of Dave Stanley, I was in Des Moines a week or so ago. I saw Dave, talked to him. He has been carrying on one of the most vigorous campaigns for the United States Senate. I applaud him for his efforts to meet you, talk to you, listen to you.', 'His experience in the State legislature, his experience as a campaigner, his fine background as a good Iowan, a good Hawkeye, in my opinion will help you and help me and help your State in the United States Senate.', 'Wiley said that I have been in this district three times. I have enjoyed every visit. And as Wiley said, the crowds are a little bigger this time, and maybe you are listening a little more. But let me say this and say it with emphasis: When you have someone like Wiley Mayne representing you in the Sixth District, when you have somebody like him that stands up for you in the highest councils of the Federal Government, then I hope you feel that it is time for you to stand up for him in return.', 'I left Washington a little after noon. I am on the way to California, going to Oregon, to Utah, to Kansas, to--well, a couple of other places in the next 3 days. But I stopped here because I wanted to convey a specific message.', 'I wanted to convey my deep conviction of how I feel about Wiley. I think you need him. I need him. The country needs him. And on a very personal and intimate basis, I respect his judgment and his integrity.', 'If Wiley is not returned to the Congress from this Congressional district, this important agricultural district will not only lose one of the finest men in the Congress but it will lose a seniority on a committee that affects very vitally agriculture.', 'If Wiley is not in the next Congress, the potency of your representation on this great Committee on Agriculture will nosedive.', 'Now, one of my old and very good friends, Charlie Hoeven, knows that better than anybody. Charlie Hoeven, who represented this district for many, many years, was the senior Republican on the House Committee on Agriculture and knows very well the impact of a high-ranking position on that committee, the potency of that representation as it affects all of you who are interested in agriculture--whether it is on the farm or in the implement business or in the banking business or otherwise.', 'So, I strongly urge just on this very, almost selfish ground, that you make certain that Wiley continues this representation.', 'I do not mean to infer that Wiley Mayne rubber-stamps everything I suggest, either as President or as I did as Vice President or even as Republican leader in the House. He does not. He is an independent guy who gets your ideas and translates them into legislative action.', 'But even in those areas where we disagree, one thing that I particularly like about Wiley is the fact that we can disagree without being disagreeable, and that is a pretty darn good trait in any American.', 'And let me give you one illustration. Just recently, Wiley let me know very candidly, very forcefully, that he protested the action that I took on a certain Saturday to suspend--and I say suspend--certain sales of corn and wheat to the Soviet Union.', 'It did not take Wiley Mayne very long to get from Capitol Hill down to the White House to let me explain to him the justification for the action and to inform him that what I did was not a permanent one, involving this sale to the Soviet Union.', 'I assured Wiley at that time that my action on that particular occasion was not to limit exports on a permanent basis but to make certain that no single nation cornered either the corn or wheat market.', 'Forty million bushels of corn, 40 million bushels of wheat, have already been released since that time to the Soviet Union.', 'But the point I wanted to make, and make most emphatically, was that Wiley Mayne was on the firing line protecting your interest and your concern, and I congratulate you for it, Wiley.', 'One other area of great concern to you as citizens--and here is an area where both Wiley and Dave, I think, agree with me without any question--and this is the determination by them and by me to stop the rising cost of living, to do something effectively, as far as our Government is concerned, about inflation.', 'The principal cause of rising prices is the fact that our Government has been spending more than it takes in. Wiley Mayne has voted to cut spending and to balance the Federal budget in the past, and I can assure you he can be counted upon to do so in the future.', 'That is why I am here personally asking each of you, the people of the Sixth District, to send Wiley Mayne back to Congress on election day next Tuesday.', 'I can reemphasize, it really matters. America needs his very strong and his very reliable vote in the House of Representatives to help us keep back rising prices and the problems of inflation.', 'I want to also use this occasion, with your indulgence, to put some myths to rest here in Sioux City. I have seen some very interesting reports in this campaign here, and I consider it a very superb coincidence that we can bury these political hobgoblins on Halloween eve.', 'I have seen some reports around the country that some candidates of the other party are laying claim to being fiscal watchdogs. I have seen some reports that they are even accusing the Republican Party of being for high spending.', 'Now, you and I know what causes inflation. It is not the Republican Party. The facts are that it is largely due to the Government spending more money than it should. And I will tell you flatly and categorically the votes to break the budget did not come from Wiley Mayne or from those on his side of the political aisle.', 'Let\'s take a look at the record. Some great politicians in the past have said, ""Let\'s look at what the record shows."" And this is something I would like to call to your particular attention, to many people in this audience today. As I look around, I see there are a number between the ages of 20 and 42. This is an interesting fact often forgotten or not known: If you are in this age group, from 20 to 42, the Congress of the United States has been in control of one political party 85 percent of the time in your lifetime.', 'That means that 85 percent of your life has been lived under the legislative control of a single political party, and this is the party which has to be held accountable for so many of the problems that we face in this country today, including inflation--especially inflation, which is the biggest legacy of this period of monolithic Federal control.', ""Now, next Tuesday--it is a day that we cannot forget. I cannot believe there is voter apathy in the great State of Iowa. I do not believe there is voter apathy in the other 49 States. The issues are critical. The problems are serious. So, let's all make up our minds that we do not go down the same road again that has given us control by one party in 38 out of the last 42 years."", 'They have done a bad job, and they ought to be replaced.', ""Now, if you send Wiley Mayne--you send him back to the House of Representatives, and you send Dave Stanley to the United States Senate, and if you reelect Bob Ray, your great Governor, then the ticket, the Republican ticket, will be of great help in meeting the problems here in Iowa and helping to meet the challenges of those problems we face both at home and abroad and in the Nation's Capital."", 'I repeat, I need Wiley and Dave--you need them in Washington, you need Bob Ray in Des Moines. And if you go out and do the job that you can do with your friends, your neighbors, your relatives--Independents, Democrats, and others--then I am confident that you will achieve something good for yourself, your community, your State, and our great Nation.', 'Thank you very, very much.']"
10,Gerald R. Ford ,"October 31, 1974","['It is really a great privilege and pleasure for me to be introduced on this occasion by the next Governor of the great State of California, Hugh Flournoy.', 'Hugh, Governor Reagan, Bob Hope, my former colleagues in the Congress, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:', 'It is really wonderful to be here, and I do want to thank Hugh for his very fine introduction. Since I became President, I am usually introduced in a very stately and a very dignified manner, such as Hugh did tonight in a very appropriate way. But I would like to tell you about one dinner that happened quite recently when I was introduced by a former teammate of mine at the University of Michigan when I was playing football back there when the ball was round.', 'I will never forget that introduction. He said something like this: ""Ladies and gentlemen, it might interest you to know that I played football with Jerry Ford for 2 years, and it made a lasting impression on me. I was a quarterback, and Jerry was the center. And you might say it gave me a completely different view of the President of the United States."" [Laughter]', 'But it is a particular pleasure to be in California again, and I have been here a number of times over the last 25 years in political life. California--the State that puts together such great football teams as the UCLA Bruins and the USC Trojans.', 'As a former football player for the Big Ten, I have always been very, very grateful for those practice teams that you have given us to play against. Well, we call it practice--I think you call it the Rose Bowl.', 'The last time--this is the last time I am going to buy a joke from Woody Hayes at Ohio State. [Laughter] It is pretty obvious I enjoy being here in California, the State that is governed by Ronnie Reagan, served by Hugh Flournoy, and owned by Bob Hope. [Laughter]', 'It was very kind of Bob to mention my golf game, but as he well knows, it is not worth mentioning. Bob vows he will never carry me again as a partner on the golf course, and it is reciprocal, Bob. [Laughter]', ""Frankly, I have the same problem with golf that George Foreman had with Muhammad Ali. My swing is very good; I just did not or don't connect often enough.1 [Laughter]"", 'I appreciate, as Bob knows, his being here tonight, because at 10:00 tonight, the Dean Martin roast of Bob Hope will be shown on television. Dean and Bob had invited me to be on the show, but unfortunately, at almost the last minute some special problems arose in the Oval Office that precluded my participation. I think it is a shame, Bob, because lately, if there is anybody who knows about roasts, it is me. [Laughter]', 'As a matter of fact, Bob and I have a great deal in common. For the last 24 years Bob has been seen on television, and for the last 25 years I have been in politics. So, we both know how to live quite dangerously. At least by the ratings. [Laughter]', 'I will only conclude by saying that Bob has done very well.', 'But I do wish to express to Governor Reagan and to Hugh and to all of the others my appreciation for being invited to visit all of you in California. I think you have achieved something quite unique in politics in America. You elected a great Governor who was an actor-turned-politician. Back in Washington, we have the reverse problem--too many politicians who have turned actor. [Laughter]', 'Quite frankly, I am talking about some Congressmen and Senators who play the role of fiscal conservatives at home, and Diamond Jim Brady in Washington.', 'I think you might call them ""method politicians."" They will try any method to get elected, and if indeed you do elect them to the House or to the Senate, they are like the child you sent at one time to the grocery store--one of your own-sometimes they don\'t remember what you sent them for. [Laughter]', ""Today is Halloween, a warm, affectionate holiday, close to the hearts of all of us in America. But my message for tonight is this: Let's keep Halloween for the children. The last thing we need in Washington is a trick and treat Congress.To be very blunt, I am talking about a Congress that hands out multi-billion dollar treats, and then the trick is how to pay for them without higher taxation or more inflation."", 'And it is my observation that one Halloween a year is enough. What we need the rest of the time in Washington, in Sacramento, in State capitals across the country, and in our county and local governments, are serious-minded, dedicated individuals, inflation fighters and energy savers.', ""I am told that Hugh Flournoy's opponent in the California gubernatorial race claims that one State alone cannot do much about inflation, that it is mainly a Federal problem."", 'Well, I for one consider California part of the Union and a very important part of our Union. One out of every ten Americans lives in this great State. You have the largest of all delegations in the Congress and the largest number of eligible voters of any State in the Union. You excel in so many, many fields-in industry, agriculture, automobiles, advanced technologies, education, effective State and local government, the arts, recreation, conservation, natural resources.', 'You have all of these great attributes and resources. You even, in my conversations with many from California, run out of superlatives when you talk about the State. And I think for good reason. So I ask, in all sincerity, this problem: California not involved in the inflation problem?', 'My answer is categorical: nonsense. You are not only one-tenth of the problem, you are also one-tenth of the solution.', ""This State has shown the rest of the country and the world there is nothing Californians can't do when they really put their shoulder to the wheel. California outstrips all but a handful of nations in wealth and productivity. Nothing California can do about inflation? I repeat, nonsense."", 'If inflation were only a problem for Washington, I would be staying in Washington trying to solve it. But the state of our economy is a national problem, and to the extent that it is a problem of the Federal Government, it is a political problem.', 'Frankly, that is why I am traveling here in California this evening and Fresno tomorrow and five or six other States this last weekend of this great campaign-to share at least my views on the 1974 political campaign and the issues that are involved.', 'And I am asking--as I and Hugh and the rest of the State ticket, including your Congressional candidates, campaign day and night, literally--I am asking all Californians to do their full share.', 'You have 10 percent of the political clout in the Congress and, I am quite frank to say, one of the ablest, as well as one of the largest Republican delegations in the House of Representatives, and I see two or three of my former colleagues in that delegation here in this room.', 'You have had a great Republican Governor and a Republican administration in Sacramento which has practiced as well as preached a progressive but fiscally sound policy of good government, in political terms.', 'There used to be a saying that ""As Maine goes, so goes the Nation."" The fact is, during my lifetime, it is the polls in California that the Nation has turned to every election night, and it is becoming more so as you grow in population and power. This is the way it will be next Tuesday, because what happens in this great State next Tuesday will be a bellwether as to what might happen in 1976.', 'If it is true that there is great voter apathy across the Nation--and the polls seem to indicate--then, in my judgment, there is time to change it, and we had better do it.', 'If only 42 percent of the eligible voters are going to turn out next Tuesday on the tremendous issues and the candidates that are involved--and this is what the experts are predicting or forecasting--that means that a slight fraction of over 21 percent of the eligible voters in this country can determine how this Nation will operate for the next 2 years in Washington, D.C.', 'Let me, in all sincerity, ask this question: Do you want that kind of minority rule in the United States of America? I do not think you do.', 'So, I say to my friends in California--to Republicans, Independents, and what President Eisenhower used to call ""discerning Democrats,"" and you have plenty of them here in California--let\'s prove that the pessimistic pollsters are totally wrong. Let\'s prove that you care what kind of government you have in Sacramento and in Washington, that you appreciate the kind of leadership that you have had with Ron Reagan, John Harmer, Hugh Flournoy, Ev Younger, what they have given to you in California for the past 8 years, and that you want an even stronger Congressional delegation to represent you in the Nation\'s Capital and to protect your paycheck and your savings in the Congress of the United States.', 'Very frankly, if you do just that, California will have won one-tenth of the battle against inflation and will once again set an example for the rest of the Nation.', 'As I indicated in the economic message that I submitted to the Congress and to the American people about a month or so ago, if we are to win against inflation, we must enlist the efforts of every individual American and every unit of government across this great country.', 'We need teamwork. We need cooperation between the Federal Government and the States like California; cooperation between individuals, between individual States and their counties and their communities. If we are going to win the struggle against inflation, we must exercise some rigid fiscal control and responsibility and prudence at every level, from the housewife making better use of her budget to the Congress in Washington curbing its appetite for uncontrollable spending.', 'I think you are fortunate here in California in that you have already established a tradition of fiscal prudence in your State government. When my good friend Ron Reagan replaced the Democrat in Sacramento nearly 8 years ago, California was suffering from a deficit of about $325 million. During the last Brown administration, I understand you could do real well in Sacramento selling red ink to the statehouse. It was not much, but it was very steady.', 'Fortunately, your great Governor cleaned up the mess that he inherited, using modern management techniques that are now being copied by Governors from many, many States, both Democratic as well as Republican.', 'As a result of this technique or technology, he was able to get your State out of the financial grief that he inherited. When Ron leaves office, I am told California will be enjoying a surplus of around $400 million.', 'That kind of fiscal prudence can make a big dent in inflation. California, as I see it, cannot afford the risk of losing what he has done by electing a big round of new spenders, statewide or nationwide. Hugh Flournoy understands this; John Harmer, your outstanding Lieutenant Governor candidate knows this. So does Bill Richardson, who will make a great Senator for your State. So does Evelle Younger, Brian [Van] Camp, Bill Bagley, John Kehoe.2 I have had the privilege in several visits to California to meet them, to compare them with the kind of people that I see on the other side of the political aisle and in other States throughout the Union.', ""So, I think in California you are fortunate, lucky to have this talent available to elect, to run your State for the next 4 years. And unlike Hugh's opponent, they also understand the concept of teamwork; teamwork in the fight against inflation and the benefits that can be derived from cooperation between the State and the Federal Government, and between the State and local units of government."", 'From Hugh Flournoy on down on the ballot, California has a Republican slate of experienced public servants--men of proven competence, integrity; men who have demonstrated that they know how to do the job and how to get it done.It is my observation we need more teamwork in Washington as well.', 'I first learned this concept, how important it was, some 25 years ago when I first took the oath of office in Washington, D.C. Earlier, a Republican Congress had worked very, very closely with a Democratic President, Harry Truman, to build a strong, bipartisan foreign policy, one that was good for America and, fortunately, good for the rest of the free world.', 'And because the Congress, which was then Republican, and the Democratic President did work together, we succeeded in mounting the Marshall Plan, the Greek-Turkish aid program, and the programs that followed, that rebuilt Europe, NATO, and produced an alliance which protected the free world from the threat of aggression from those early post-war days.', 'Today, that bipartisanship in foreign policy which has carried this Nation through some of its very roughest times, some of its greatest challenges, is being eroded by the irresponsible actions of some Members of the Congress.', 'What really concerns me is this: If the ranks of the shortsighted are swelled by elections next Tuesday, not only that delicate bipartisanship which served this country so well for over a quarter of a century could be destroyed and our total foreign policy, which is one of maintaining and building the peace, could be undermined.', 'Now, at home, we have another threat, certainly the greatest we face domestically in this country--inflation. In its own way, this deadly domestic enemy is every bit as serious as the threat that we face from abroad.', 'Again, what concerns me, if the ranks of the big spenders in the Congress, House and Senate, are increased next Tuesday the inflation-fighting program that I have asked the Congress to approve will be swamped--overloaded with massive deficit spending.', 'What we need is not a veto-proof Congress, as some have proposed, but what we actually need is an inflation-proof Congress, and we can get it next Tuesday.', ""If I might, let me be quite precise about what I mean. I do not want anyone to misunderstand. I do not believe that either of our great major political parties has a total monopoly on wisdom or on the solutions to the Nation's economic problems. We have Members on both sides of the aisle, and some of my former colleagues know who they are, who are indispensable to an inflation-proof Congress."", 'Unfortunately and very regrettably, some of the staunchest Democrats who stood up and fought to be cooperative and to be helpful are regrettably retiring voluntarily this year. And so, who they are replaced by is critical and crucial.', 'Now, I am sure that virtually every Member of the Congress has only the very best interests of our Nation at heart, and it depends on how he or she sees it.', 'Generally, when we differ, it is not so much as to the goals but the road by which you achieve it. The question we face right today--it will be reemphasized and reiterated when Congress comes back on November 18--what is the best way to beat inflation? I have labeled it public enemy number one. A lot of different people have a lot of different views, and as I think most of you know, we had this summit meeting on the economy that was the result of 12 mini-summits that were held all over the United States where we had labor, management, economists, bankers, housewives, and others participating.', 'I, at least, had an open mind and was the beneficiary of the suggestions that were made by this broad-based cross section of America. There was one point, however, on which there was substantial, almost unanimous agreement on which a majority of Americans seemed to agree: that excess Government spending has been, and will continue to be, a root cause of inflation.', 'No government, no government that I have read about, studied about, participated in, can keep on spending more than it takes in without driving down the buying power of its currency and driving up the cost of living for its people.', 'In the short haul, it is very easy for government to yield to the temptation to give people what they want or what the politicians tell them that they ought to have, but keep this in mind: In the long haul, a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.', 'So, when you come right down to a very basic subject, we must curb Federal spending as far as the Federal Government, the Congress, the President are concerned. In the economic message that I submitted to the Congress just before the recess, I proposed that we establish a spending ceiling this year of some $300 billion, or some $5.5 billion less than the budget as it was submitted last January. But the current Congress has not yet approved that spending ceiling. The House of Representatives did act, but the Senate did not.', 'There are some other proposals in that economic package which is aimed at tightening the screws on inflation and yet giving some help and assistance as far as the economy is concerned to strengthen it.', 'I hope when Congress reconvenes in the month or the weeks between November 18 and January 3, we will meet the challenge and act effectively on this, I think, finely tuned proposal.', ""Now, I am not going to be so brash as to stand here and tell you that all of the big spenders belong to the opposition party, although the percentages tilt pretty far that way. But I would like to note--I would like you to note, and Governor Reagan mentioned it, others have said it, but I think it' is good to reemphasize it--that the Democratic Party has controlled the United States Congress for 38 out of the last 42 years, and for the last 20 years consecutively."", 'During this period of time, Federal spending has shot up from roughly $4.5 billion on an annual basis in 1934 to $300-plus billion in the current fiscal year. It is a simple fact that no President and no Administration can spend a single dollar--and to be more precise, a single penny--that Congress has first not appropriated.', ""I cannot emphasize that enough. Congress appropriates every penny that is spent by any President or by any Administration. So, when you look at it, if you are unhappy about the handling of our Nation's .finances in the Capital over the past 20 years, if you think it is time for a change, remember next Tuesday who the big spenders are and throw the big spenders out. And if some of them are Republicans, so be it."", 'I think it is time for responsible men and women of all political persuasions-Republicans, Democrats, Independents--to come together, not in an effort for a political advantage, but in a spirit of true American patriotism, to whip problems like inflation, energy, the environment, to strengthen our successful foreign policy by the restoration of bipartisanship. And it is also time for the American voter, whatever his views, to demonstrate by the ballot that he supports a responsible and responsive anti-inflation policy; that he opposes wasteful Government spending; that he demands a strong, secure national defense program; and most important, that he wants elected representatives who feel the same way.', 'And in Congress, that does not mean a one-party monopoly. It does mean a Congress in which reasonable men of both parties can work together with an administration in a spirit of cooperation for the good of all of us.', 'I think this is the kind of Congress I have tried to campaign for in some 14 or 15 States in the last month, and with your help, it is the kind of a Congress that we can elect.', 'If we are successful next Tuesday, the average hard-working American citizen will be the beneficiary.', 'Just a few weeks ago, while I was out on the campaign trail, I met a lovely lady whose husband is now retired. After working very, very hard all their lives, they are living on social security and a small pension. They were beautiful people.', 'After I shook hands with her, she reached in her purse and handed me a little slip of paper. It was a supermarket register receipt like the one I am holding in my hand.', 'She told me that she appreciated many of the suggestions I had made on television on what an individual citizen. or family might do to help in the battle against inflation. But she said both of them--she and her husband--already were doing most of those things and were trying to do more. Yet the total each week of this little grocery slip kept going up and up and up.', 'She said, ""Mr. President, can\'t you do something about this?""', 'I looked her in the eye. I said, ""Yes, but I cannot do it all alone. I need a lot of help. I need the help of responsible people, like-minded individuals in the Senate, in the House of Representatives.""', 'And she looked at me with a kindly smile and said she understood and would do her part on election day.', 'In the final analysis, let me say to each and every one of you, that is what this great national election is all about--to make sure we have a responsible and responsive Congress for the next 2 years, responsible to the people and responsive to their needs.', 'As I close, let me make this suggestion to each of you. When you go into the voting booth next Tuesday, take with you your latest grocery slip, your check-out receipt, and before you vote, take a good hard look at the bottom line. Then vote for the candidates who will really make sure and certain that your paycheck buys as much on the day that you spend it as on the day that you earned it.', 'Thank you very much.']"
11,Gerald R. Ford ,"November 01, 1974","['Bob Mathias, Congressman Chuck Wiggins, Carol Harner, distinguished mayors, members of the State legislature, members of the Board of County Commissioners, the wonderful bands from--I still get a great thrill out of hearing the National Anthem played, as I am sure Bob Mathias did, both at London and Helsinki when he won, representing all of us in the decathlon. It is a great, great thrill.', 'It is nice to see all these wonderful young people and all of you from Fresno, Kings, and Tulare Counties. I thank you for a super-enthusiastic, warm welcome. I am very, very, very grateful. Thank you very much.', 'I think you can tell from the reaction that it is a great experience for me to be in the central valley of California. And as I look around this big valley to fine people, I noticed that as I flew in this morning it is a big valley, and the big crops that it produces, the big yields that come from the soil, and the labor, the big livestock, to serve its people in Congress it produces big men, mentally and otherwise, in Bob Mathias. And frankly, that is why I am here.', 'It is really no secret--I need Bob Mathias. I think you need Bob Mathias. I think the country needs Bob Mathias back in Washington to represent these three great counties of Fresno, Kings, and Tulare. And I am counting on your doing it.', ""I have been asked many times why have I traveled extensively in the last few weeks, candidly asking American voters to return men like Bob Mathias back to Congress. People have asked why, and let me give you the answer. It is very simple. I am here because the issues are far, far too important. It is far, far too vital for me to sit on the sidelines. I never have, and I don't intend to, when I feel strongly about people and about issues. The stakes are far too high to be a sideline sitter when we have got people like Bob Mathias out in the hustings."", 'And there is another answer, too. I do it because the people of Fresno, the 340,000 or 350,000 people in this 17th Congressional District, in my judgment, deserve to see their President and deserve to see a President who believes with conviction and dedication in the issues and in the solutions that I think can make America a bigger, better, stronger, finer country for all of us--particularly these fine young people down here in the front rows.', 'Public service, public responsibility are far too important for me to sit in that beautiful Oval Office in a mystic stance in Washington, D.C., when I can come out here to Fresno in the 17th Congressional District and have an opportunity to see the wonderful faces, the enthusiasm.', 'I enjoy being on the banks of the Potomac, but I get a big thrill and a big shot in the arm coming to Fresno on an occasion like this.', 'I am out here--I am particularly here because there are some issues that, in my judgment, deserve to be talked about, to be discussed, so that the problems we have can be communicated to you with the solutions and the answers that we have.', 'We do have a serious problem of inflation. We have some other economic problems, but the answers can be gotten by all of you and by all of us in the executive as well as in the legislative branch.', 'To solve those problems, I need people like Bob Mathias who, in my opinion, from his past record, can be extremely helpful. He is a big man, but he is a big man in action. He is not a big man of talk. He is a big man as a problemsolver, and that is what you want in the 17th District representing you.', 'And let me give you if I can, very seriously, an extremely practical reason why I think Bob ought to be sent back next Tuesday, for you, for me, for the country. I could not help but notice as we flew in and saw the beautiful fields and the people working in them--Bob Mathias, when he is returned to Congress will be the second man on our side of the aisle on the great Committee on Agriculture, and agriculture is important to all of you.', 'That is the committee that drafts the legislation. That is the committee that guides it through the House of Representatives. That is the committee that has a direct connection with the Department of Agriculture, and with Bob Mathias in that high-ranking, number two position on the Committee on Agriculture, you will have a voice at the top, a voice of experience instead of a person at the bottom with a big voice but no communication.', 'Let me tell you something else about Bob. When I was the minority leader in the House of Representatives, I had the opportunity of working intimately, very closely with Bob Mathias on a number of legislative matters. But what was important in that relationship to all of you was that when I wanted some straight answers, some sound suggestions about agriculture, one of the finest, most helpful voices, to me, was the observations, the recommendations, the advice from Bob Mathias.', 'He advised me then and he advises me on agriculture as the occupant of the White House, and I thank you, Bob, for your help then and your assistance now.', ""I have heard, Bob, about the hard campaign that you are running, working literally night and day to communicate your positions, your achievements to the 400,000-plus people that live in the 17th Congressional District. And I won't try to repeat all the things that you can speak up about, what you have done, how you voted."", 'I do know--and let me mention very quickly--some areas that ought to be reemphasized. For example, you have introduced a number of important, very vital pieces of legislation that affect all the young people, as well as the old; legislation to protect our natural resources and our environment, preserving the beauty of our national parks--and I saw some of them as I flew from the Los Angeles area here this morning.', 'I think it is vitally important for everybody, the young as well as the others, to know that you have introduced and pushed legislation to provide new jobs for all of the people in the central valley.', 'I think people ought to know what you have done in the way of legislation to open the flow of energy resources to our people, and if we are going to grow and prosper and to provide jobs and homes and opportunities for these young people, particularly--and I am looking right at them and talking to them directly--we need energy. We need energy to make a better America.', 'And I know, Bob, of your personal interest in education. You are interested in health legislation. So you have had not only great experience in the field of agriculture but you have had an interest in environment, our ecology. You have had an interest in energy, you have had an interest in jobs and health and education. Yes, your experience in these areas has been invaluable to the people in this Congressional district.', 'But let me mention one other area that I hope and trust does have an impact on all of you, and I speak now of the field of foreign policy. Bob Mathias has another great committee responsibility, as a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. That is the committee that puts together that legislation that helped to achieve the peace. It is the committee that puts together the legislation that will maintain the peace. It is the committee that will build a better America here so we can have peace abroad.', 'But let me speak, if I might, about the subject that I consider public enemy number one, domestically--inflation. Inflation, according to all polls, is the matter of primary interest, the highest-ranking matter of concern to the American people, some 83 percent. There is one way that all of us, and particularly those in the Congress, can do something about it, and that is to cut, to slice the fat off the Federal budget.', 'This can help us curb rampant inflation. Bob Mathias has a reputation in the Congress for being an inflation fighter. I understand that his opponent is pretty well beholden to the people that want a veto-proof Congress.', 'Well, a veto-proof Congress, in my judgment, will do more to increase inflation than anything I can imagine. What we want is not a veto-proof Congress, but we want an inflation-proof Congress, and Bob Mathias can give us that.', 'As I heard the Star-Spangled Banner, or National Anthem, being played, I thought back--in 1948 when I first ran for the Congress of the United States as an ex-athlete, and it goes back a long time. I was proud of the representation that Bob Mathias at the ripe old age of 17 was giving our country in the Olympics, a gold medal winner both in London as well as Helsinki. And I was proud of him then, and I am very proud of him and the contributions that he has made to our country today.', 'This kind of representation, as a young man and as a legislator, is good for our country.', 'I am informed that in this area, perhaps--maybe around the Nation--there is an apathy about this election. I hope and trust this is not true in Kings and Fresno and Tulare Counties. I hope it is not true in the great State of California. And I am going to do the maximum that I can to prevent it from being true in the rest of the country.', ""I don't believe people are discouraged, disillusioned, turned off. I don't believe we are going to have only 42 percent of the eligible voters in America participate in that great election in all 50 States next Tuesday."", 'Let me tell you why I think it would be tragic, why it would be catastrophic. If only 42 percent of the American people vote next Tuesday, it means that 21 percent of the eligible voters in America will make the decision for 100 percent.', 'Now, we want not 21 percent of the people telling us how to run the Government. I think we want 100 percent of the people. And I say to all of you young people, those right in front of me and those in the bands: I think you have a very special mission. You have more impact, you have more influence, you can do more to get your parents to go and cast that ballot than anybody else in the whole area of Fresno and the surrounding environs.', 'I hope you will make that a special mission, to grab Mom and Dad by the hand and ask them on Tuesday morning, ""Are you going to vote?"" You can, and you will.', 'And this is important for Democrats, Independents, and Republicans alike. If they do, I am confident that you will send people like Bob Mathias back to Congress. You will send people like Hugh Flournoy to the statehouse in Sacramento. I think you will send a good team to help Hugh Flournoy in your great State capital of Sacramento.', 'Now, it is just as important to attack the problems in Sacramento as it is in Washington. We want a creative Congress. We want a forward-looking occupant of your statehouse, your State capital in Sacramento. We want responsive, responsible government in all parts of our government at the local, State, and national level.', 'The urgency of the problem to be responsible and responsive in the handling of your tax dollars is not just at the national, it is at the State or the local level.', ""I am told that Hugh Flournoy's opponent for the off:ice of Governor in the State of California says inflation is not the problem of California."", 'I respectfully disagree with that very limited observation. California is onetenth of the American people. It is the biggest State. It has got the biggest vision. It is a rapidly growing State, and I am amazed that a candidate for the Governorship of California would have such a limited perspective of the problem.', 'It seems to me that a prospective, or a candidate for Governor of California ought to recognize that with a State as big, as wealthy, as powerful--can have an impact on inflation. One out of every ten people in the United States lives in California. And what you do and what your delegation does in the Congress of the United States will have an impact.', 'I respectfully say that California must be involved, and for any candidate for Governor to say that it is not, is pure nonsense.', 'We cannot fight inflation without the help of California, and a Governor like Hugh Flournoy will help us fight inflation. And with that kind of help, we can do something about it.', 'Let me just make this final observation. My message to you here today is a very simple one, and I hope you will pass it on to your friends between now and Tuesday. If the big spenders get control of Congress, if the big spenders control your statehouse and your State capital, we cannot, in all honesty, do much about inflation, because excessive spending at the State level or at the Federal level is a major cause, a principal reason for inflation.', 'And so I ask you very strongly, but very simply, to send the kind of people back to Washington who you can trust, who will watch your tax dollars. I urge you to send people to Sacramento who will do a first-class job in watching the money that you send to your State capital.', 'Actually, the key to the battle against inflation is within our honest, personal reach. All you have to do on November 5 is to go into the sanctity of that voting booth and pull the right lever. Good leadership is the answer. I am trying to do it in the White House. Bob Mathias has sought to do it in the Congress of the United States. Hugh Flournoy will do it for you in the State capital.', 'Leadership, whether it is in Washington or Sacramento, is vital. And what you do in the quiet, personal relationship that you have in that voting booth is of great importance--yes, to you and to me, but more importantly to all of us.', 'And I urge you, not for the sake of one political party but for the sake of America, be a leader next Tuesday; be a leader in making the right decision. Let your vote and your voice reelect and elect the kind of men and women to public office who will bring out the best in our great country.', 'I am confident that you will, and that is why I am here to see all of you. Good luck, Bob.', 'Good luck to all of you who support him.', 'Let me express my very deep appreciation and gratitude. I am not going to get into a discussion whether your band or your football team is the best, but let me say this: I like a mayor who thinks they have the best band and the best football team.', 'And may I add that I have got a 16-year-old son who is working as a ranch hand out in Lolo, Montana. He decided that he wanted to learn to be a rancher, so he is out there, and I am going to see him tomorrow. And I am not going to tell him I have this great, great cowboy hat. I will tell him, maybe I cannot ride as well as he can, but I might look like a cowboy if I cannot perform the function.', 'Thank you very, very much.']"

I played at the University of Michigan so far back--it was back when the ball was round--and after winning the national championship for my first 2 years, my senior year we won one and lost seven. And at the end of the season, my teammates voted me the most valuable player. I don't know what they were trying to tell me. [Laughter]"", 'But I am particularly pleased to be in Utah, because I have been here many, many times. I have skied at Alta, Park City, Snow Basin. I hope to come out again and ski at Snow Bird.', 'I like people from Utah. Some of our closest and best friends come from your great State.', 'Let me express my deep appreciation to the Kearns High School band as well as to the Davis High School band. The music that was played by both was wonderful, stirring, the kind of music that I like.', 'You know, music usually provides us with great beauty, but sometimes it provides us with the truth as well.', 'Last week, I went back to my hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan, and we had a big night rally in an arena at Calvin College, much like this one. As I came into the building, I heard the master of ceremonies ask the band for just one more selection, something that would be appropriate for the President of the United States.', 'So, they played ""Nobody Knows the Trouble I\'ve Seen."" [Laughter]', 'But I do express my gratitude for the warm and very friendly welcome, and I cannot think of one trouble I could ever have in the State of Utah. You are the kind of people I like and enjoy.', 'It convinces me that when I agreed to come to visit Utah today, this is one Ford who really did have a better idea.', 'And let me congratulate you--because I know them, I have met them, I have worked with them--on the exceptional slate of Republican candidates that you have here in Utah. I have seen a lot, and they are among the very best. And I look forward to working with them next year in Washington, D.C.', 'I have seen a lot of mayors. I worked with a great many Senators. And it is my honest judgment and recommendation that the country, the State, all of you as well as myself, need Jake Garn in the United States Senate.', 'I never got that kind of an accolade when I was running for the House of Representatives in my own district. So, lake, you are doing very well, and for good and sufficient reasons.', 'But I am a product, as all of you know, of the House of Representatives, and I am proud of the 25-plus years that I served with 435 other Members on both sides of the aisle. So, I know a little bit about the kind of Members of the House that will do a good job, and I can recommend to you Steve Harmsen for his youth, his vigor, his organized approach to the problems that he will face on your behalf.', 'I strongly recommend Steve to be returned and sent to Washington on your behalf.', 'And although my contact with Ron has not been as extensive, I am impressed with a fine, strong, able young man. Good luck to you, Ron.', 'There is one particular area where Jake Garn and I wholeheartedly agree-and this really ought not to be a partisan issue, because there are as many Democratic mayors in this country as there are Republican mayors who have the same thoughts, the same beliefs--that decentralization of the Federal Government would make our system work far, far better. And therefore, in my opinion, there is no more urgent need or item, if I might say, of long-range, national business before us to day. We must cut the power. We must trim the size of the bureaucracy in Washington. It would be good for the country.', 'I should add that I have ordered a cut of 40,000 in the bureaucracy, in the Federal bureaucracy, and we are going to achieve that end. It will save us about $300 million in 1 year, but it will make the system work better just as well.', ""There is only one real way that we are going to solve some of these difficult problems that we face as fellow citizens in this country. We must communicate more effectively with one another. And frankly, that is why I am here in Utah. I can learn much more about the needs and the desires of the citizens of Utah in 1 hour's worth of conversation with men like Jake Garn, your great senior Senator, Wallace Bennett, than I could learn in 8 months back in the Oval Office talking to Potomac bureaucrats about the problems of Utah."", 'Frankly, that is precisely the problem with an overgrown, all-political bureaucracy. There is no two-way communication. Each State and locality in this Nation has its own needs, its own priorities, and the priorities of Salt Lake are different than those of Miami, and the ones of Seattle are quite different from those of Baltimore.', ""So, these unique, these unusual needs and priorities cannot be understood and dealt with from a very, very remote vantage point in the Nation's Capital."", ""The day is past, in my honest judgment, when an octopus-like Government in the Nation's Capital can stretch its tentacles across the Nation and literally squeeze into itself more and more power."", 'In my judgment, we have to chop off those tentacles, and as each of those tentacles wither, we have to return the power and the revenue that they have grasped back to the States and to the local communities where they honestly belong--back to the taxpayers, the local taxpayers who made the funds available in the first place.', 'As we carry out this decentralization process, it is absolutely essential that we have men in Washington who can tell us precisely what their constituents want and how they want it done.', 'And that is why, without any hesitation, reservation, or qualification, I urge you to send Jake Garn to the United States Senate.', 'As a local official, Jake has a unique and firsthand knowledge of what the people of Utah really want. As a Senator, he will be able to put that knowledge to use, firsthand.', 'Now, one of my primary goals as President is to return governmental control to the American people, and I need Jake in Washington to help me achieve and realize that very important goal.', 'It will not be an easy job. I am not standing here trying to kid you. It is never easy to dismantle a rickety structure that has been reinforced in a patchwork way for decades. If you knock out the wrong section, the whole thing could or is liable to fall and hurt a lot of innocent people.', ""We do not want that. But the job has to be done. For too long, politicians have operated on the principle that you can bring heaven to Earth by piling Federal programs like layer cake and frosting them with Federal money. It won't and it has not worked."", 'The result or the consequence has been a huge, cumbersome, totally unresponsive central government that increasingly threatens to assert control over nearly every aspect of our personal lives.', 'The intentions of the people who have helped build the Federal layer cake are noble ones. I do not challenge their motives or their intentions. They actually, sincerely believe that if the Government ministers to every need and to every concern that it has among all the 213 million citizens, those citizens will be happier and will be better off. But let me make a critical, crucial point. What they really forget, and what millions of Americans are now remembering, is that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.', 'But what they forget, and what millions of Americans are now remembering, is that in the end, no government can make us better and happier people if it takes from us that one essential ingredient for happiness, our individual freedom.', ""The lesson of the past few decades has been a basic one. We cannot spend our way into happiness. But we can spend ourselves into debt, and we can spend our Nation's strength straight into raging inflation."", 'That is why, in these past few weeks, I have been speaking out for realistic, fiscally responsible Congressional candidates.', ""Inflation is our Nation's public enemy number one, and one way to beat inflation most effectively is to keep the lid on Federal spending. That is why I urge you to send to the Congress an inflation-proof Congress next Tuesday."", 'If the people who wish to spend and spend--and they can be called big spenders--win heavily on November 5, we are in danger of electing a veto-proof Congress, rather than an inflation-proof Congress. I think you want an inflation-proof Congress, not a veto-proof Congress.', ""Such a Congress threatened, or unrestrained by a threat of a Presidential veto, would spend the dome right off our Nation's Capitol. Our Nation, in this very challenging world, simply cannot afford a veto-proof Congress controlled by those that want to spend all of your money and much more, too."", 'Big spending got our economy into the trouble it is experiencing today, and now we are threatened with a Congress whose prescription is more spending.', 'I do not think it makes much sense. It is my judgment that the immediate medicine our economy needs is a good strong dose of fiscal discipline. And frankly, that is why I am asking voters all across this Nation, all across the political spectrum--Democrats, Independents, and Republicans--to vote as inflation fighters rather than as political partisans.', 'I pledge to do everything possible in my power to hold down excessive spending from the Federal Treasury, and I ask you to send men and women to Washington, men like Jake Garn, who---I know from his record, his experience, his knowledge--will help me in this vitally important task.', ""I don't stand here and kid you that it is an easy task. There is no easy cure for the inflationary illness that infects our economy, and I do not think it makes you any happier for me to be able to say that our inflationary rates, our increases in the cost of living are less than those in Japan or Great Britain or any one of a number of other countries; that does not help us do something about the problem."", 'But we have to understand that it takes patience, it takes hard work, it takes strength of character, and it takes a little time, unfortunately.', 'It will also require some short-term sacrifices to serve our long-term national interest. As I said in my 31-point program to Congress, which is aimed at controlling inflation and stabilizing and strengthening our economy and also calling upon people to help us in the conservation of energy, in the building of greater energy potential--in the 31-point program that I submitted to the Congress were suggestions by individual citizens who might participate in the battle against inflation so that we as a country, 213 million of us, can share that burden equally.', 'Each of us must make a little sacrifice so that none will suffer. And as you know, the sacrifice that all of us make, I think, will make it better for everybody.', 'Now, one important recommendation in my inflation-fighting and energysaving program, one of the 31 proposals that I made was to tighten up and to increase the penalties for antitrust and price-fixing action.', ""That legislation has been lying dormant in the House Committee on the Judiciary. I think it is legitimate to ask every member of that committee why haven't they acted."", 'If we can do something about price fixing, if we can do something about the antitrust action--and let me illustrate what I recommended: that we increase the penalties for violations from $50,000 to $1 million--and nothing has happened in the Congress or in the Committee on the Judiciary.', 'You may remember that I recently made a speech to the Future Farmers of America in which I attempted to outline some specific ways in which all Americans could pitch into the fight against inflation.', 'But as I prepared these remarks for this wonderful audience in Utah and as I thought about your wonderful way of life in this tremendous State, it occurred to me that perhaps what I was suggesting in the speech to the Future Farmers of America was not really sacrifice at all. Perhaps I was just suggesting that my fellow Americans return to those good, sound, basic values of self-sufficiency, thrift, and self-reliance.', 'Those are the values, combined with a belief in God and a love of family, that built this great State of Utah.', 'Fortunately, those are the same fundamental values that made America great. Yes, I have asked Americans to save. I have asked them to budget. I have asked them to economize. I have asked them to guard their health. And I have asked them to cut out waste--and that includes the Ford family as well.', 'As I prepared these remarks, I realized that what I have been suggesting to millions and millions of Americans was simply accepted practice in the State of Utah. So, there is really no need for me to preach about those old basic values to all of you, for your daily lives in Utah are shaped by those wonderful values that I respect and admire.', 'But I do want you to know that by living those values, you are a source of inspiration to all Americans, including myself. And I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for proving to all of us that old values are alive and well and working.', 'And I can also tell you that Wallace Bennett has done an inspiring job. And when Wallace leaves, we will miss Frances just as well. She has been great in every, every way possible.', 'I just told Wallace that he may leave the Senate, but we are going to make use of him someplace. Anybody that is as strong and as good and dedicated as Wallace--America needs him, and we are going to take advantage of him.', 'I know, because our careers started relatively the same time. Here was a man, a giant of the Senate: strong, a stainless moral leader, and a tireless champion of fiscal responsibility.', 'We all hate to see him go, but our prayers and our very, very best wishes will be with him and Frances as they come home again to their beloved Utah. And with people like Wallace Bennett and Jake Garn and people like all of you to serve as examples. I am more and more confident than ever that we can bring our economy back to full and lasting health.', 'And perhaps in the process of doing so, perhaps as we do cut away frills and nonessentials, we will rediscover something valuable about ourselves that some of us may, unfortunately, have forgotten.', 'You understand very precisely here in Utah what those basic values are. Now it is time to get out and to preach them to our fellow Americans in the other 49 States. Now is the time to apply them to the war against inflation.', 'Let us let the first shot in that war come out of the ballot box next Tuesday, and let it be a shot heard around the country and around the world.', 'Cast your vote for the party that will, with a cooperative Congress, reestablish stability in our economy and common sense and good direction to our government. Cast your vote for the men who will be a part of a strong, responsive, responsible, inflation-proof Congress.', 'We need them now, much more than ever. As one TV commentator put it recently, and let me quote him: I am looking for a Congress that will praise the Lord and pass the legislation.', 'Thank you very much.']"
13,Gerald R. Ford ,"November 02, 1974","['Pete, Governor Vanderhoof, Lieutenant Governor Strickland, my former colleagues in the House of Representatives, Jim Johnson, who represents an area of this great country that I love and adore:', 'It gives me a lot of trouble--Vail, Colorado--but let me also say it is wonderful to be here with my old and very, very dear friend, Wayne Aspinall, who took the same oath of office that I did on January 3, 1949. I am proud--you know, I just feel emotional about our relationship over a long period of time.', ""I can tell you that his office was opposite mine on the corridor--as a matter of fact, Jack Kennedy's was just a couple of offices down--and all I am saying is that in Wayne Aspinall, I developed a close, personal rapport that transcends partisan politics. He and I disagreed, but friendship you don't sell out. You keep it. You love it. And that is my relationship with Wayne Aspinall."", 'You know, it is great to be in Colorado--West--again. It has often been said that Colorado is a land of breathtaking beauty, and after crowning your homecoming queen and her lovely court--I would have a tough time picking who was going to win, I might add--a breathtaking beauty as well, and I congratulate you for everything. A college homecoming is a happy time and I wish Mesa College Mavericks--Mesa but we have some community names out in Michigan all of you could not pronounce, either. I love you, anyhow.', 'But I understand this has been one of your better years, and as a former football player at the University of Michigan, I know what a 1-5-1 season is. You know, my senior year at Michigan, after being national champions with undefeated teams for 2 years, the year that I was supposed to be constructive we ended up with a one win and seven lost--and we lost to Ohio State 34 to 0. We are going to do better this fall.', 'Well, anyhow, I was elected the most valuable player by my teammates after losing seven out of the eight games, and I did not know whether to sue or smile. [Laughter]', ""Well, as some of you already know, the Ford family has a very special place in our heart for Colorado. It is our second home. We are not voting taxpayers, but we don't mind because we think we get our money's worth under your good Governor and under Pete Dominick and the others, so we just love being here in Colorado. We wish we could be here more often, and we might surprise you."", 'I just hope you get a little more snow earlier than you did last year. Have you got some?', ""That is Vail over there, I guess, isn't it? All right. We love it. We will be here if we get a cooperative Congress. I wish you could promise me that; it would be good for the country."", 'Well, anyhow, Betty and the Ford children and I have had great times here. We have been to Aspen. We have been to Vail. We have been many other places in Colorado and we love the people. We love the country. We love the total atmosphere, and it is so nice to be here on a Saturday afternoon. We are looking forward to coming back, and thank you very, very much.', ""Let me just say that when I come to a place like this with a ballpark and so many people and so many fine public servants and your Governor and Pete and Jim Johnson and my former colleague, Wayne Aspinall, it just convinces me that this country is predicated on the strength and the diversity of people-Democrats, Republicans, Independents--you know, people who were born here, people who came here, people who migrate to Colorado. Aren't we lucky to have a country where all of these assets and attributes just come out in a place like Grand Junction? I think it is wonderful."", 'You know, you are a long way from Florida, you are a long way from Alaska, you are far, far away from New York and California, but you have something special. The Continental Divide does not divide our country. As long as we remain one people in spirit, as long as we continue to share the ideals of freedom, dignity, opportunity that brought us together in the first place, we will remain united.', 'And it is because of this ""grand junction"" of interest in ideals that I am optimistic when it comes to America. There are plenty of big problems that are waiting to be solved--inflation, energy, pollution, crime--to name only a few. But there is not one of them that we as Americans can\'t lick if we pull together and act responsibly. There is, however, one thing our elected officials must remember. No government can expect the people to act responsibly when it fails to do so itself.', 'If your government does not act to give you an example, if it does not tighten its belt, if it does not give you vision, imagination, strength, courage, dedication, how can government ask you to respond accordingly?', 'You cannot, from a governmental point of view, ask people to do something about whipping inflation if the Congress is dominated by the people that want to spend and spend and spend, keep on stoking the fires of inflation with excessive spending. If they are going to spend more than they take in, year after year after year, how can we ask honest, decent, responsible citizens to act a little differently if you cannot do it? There is not a double standard.', 'Well, we cannot expect people to set aside their differences and pull together as long as a spirit of irresponsibility--irresponsible partisanship, if I can define it a bit--and rankling prevails in government.', 'And this is one of the reasons, quite frankly, that I am here today. I want to ask for your help, your help in giving the American people the kind of problemsolving government all of us want and every one of us deserves. And believe me, as Coloradans there is plenty of that that all of you and I, as a taxpaying but nonvoting Coloradan, can do, too.', 'Again and again, as I have traveled around this country in recent weeks--and I have traveled around 18,000 miles--I have tried to stimulate people in our country. Yes, I have a little partisan interest, but I have a greater interest--and I think Wayne Aspinall would agree with me--I have got an interest that involves you, whether you are Democrats, Republicans, Independents, or otherwise.', 'Gosh, what a stake we have in a country like this. If you have ever traveled abroad you have understood the comparison between what we have and what others might have.', 'It is almost unbelievable, but I am told that the speculators and forecasters are saying that 42 percent of the people eligible to vote on next Tuesday will cast their ballots. Forty-two percent; which means that if 21 percent of the people eligible to vote, or slightly over 50 percent of those 42 percent, decide something, you are going to be in the minority; you will have decisions made by people that are in the minority. I will abide by what the majority of our people say, whether they are Democrat, Independent, or Republican. But I cannot accept the fact that Americans--bearing in mind what so many have given in the way of their life, their sacrifices overseas and otherwise--that only 42 percent are going to let 21 percent of the people make their decisions. Is that American? Is that what our country was rounded on, what is the concept of our whole system?', 'We want people to get out and vote and to express themselves, to make a determination. And if we do, we will accept it, and it will be better for all of us. And you in Colorado know that if that is done you will reelect your fine Governor, who has done much to make your State healthy economically, burgeoning in activity, and yet who has done a great job in keeping the right balance in-between growth and our environment. And I am glad to be here, John, to participate in something that is a tribute to you and your leadership in the statehouse.', 'Something I have been interested in for a long time is reorganization of the executive branch. We are going to do something about it in the Federal Government, but your fine Governor has already done something about it in the State government. And I congratulate you and compliment you for this achievement.', 'Now, let me say something about your Congressional delegation. You have got, in Jim Johnson, you have got a person who represents this district with great capability, character, and dedication. Now, Jim--when I was minority leader in the House--did not always agree with me. We always disagreed without being disagreeable. But I respected his independence; but I also appreciated his willingness to be a teamplayer when he could move and be strong and helpful. So, I express to you, Jim, my deep gratitude not only for your teamwork but your independence. It is good for our country.', 'Bill Armstrong, another one of your fine Members of the House of Representatives--I think he is great. He came when Jim did. He represents a little different part of your great State, but it is an important, an integral part of our great State of Colorado. And I congratulate him, and I hope you will support him in this reelection campaign.', 'I had the opportunity of knowing Don Brotzman for a number of years, and Don--I have skied with him and I also served with him--he is a little better in both respects, and I therefore recommend him to be reelected by the people of Colorado.', 'Well, you have got some challengers, some candidates, that I hope you will support. Keith Records 1--I hope you will give him the best support, and the biggest help that you possibly can. He has got a good, sound approach to the problems that I think are important to our country.', 'Then you have Frank Southworth.2 I know Frank. I know the problems, some of the difficult areas of the city of Denver. He has got range and depth and experience. He served on the school board and has been a leader in trying to give quality education to the people and to the students of Denver. I congratulate him and urge his full and total support.', 'But now I come to something that really--if I could just make a special contribution here, it is to Pete Dominick. You know, Pete and I have known one another for 30 years, so it is not one of these political convenience acquaintanceships. I have known Pete when he was a law school student and I was. I have known Pete in subsequent years. I knew him as a Member of the House of Representatives. I watched him when he was a Member of the Senate and I was the presiding officer as Vice President. I have watched him intimately as I have been President and he has been a Senator. I think he has done a great job. And if I were in Colorado with the right to vote, I would vote for Pete Dominick as strongly and as effectively as I possibly could.', 'Well, Pete gives me the kind of representation that I would like, and therefore, I am delighted to be in Grand Junction. He has all the attributes, the wisdom, the experience, and the kind of knowledge that makes the difference between doing what is right and what is wrong.', 'Well, let me turn very quickly, if I might--I am going to throw away this part of my prepared text and talk to you frankly. I come from an area in Michigan that probably has more people with the name of ""Van"" of any area in the whole United States. I had Holland, Michigan; Zeeland, Michigan; Great London, Michigan, et cetera. Gee, they had good judgment. They voted 76 percent Republican. And I was not a Hollander, but I had, I think, a sound philosophy, or at least they think I did.', 'And so, when I come out and see a Vanderhoof, that is like talking to my old friends that I tried hard to represent in Holland and Zeeland and Great London and all the other places for 26 years. So, I understand a good public servant in John Vanderhoof. You better reelect him. He is good for Colorado.', 'Now, certainly, after I meet this great gang here today on this platform, I am going to meet with the Colorado cattlemen. This is not the first group of cattlemen that I have met with in the last week. I have met with a group in Oklahoma City. I met with a group in Washington. I met with a group in Portland, Oregon, yesterday, and I am looking forward to meeting this group in Colorado this afternoon.', ""I know that they have got particular problems, and you have similar problems here in this area of this great State. But let me make an observation or two. I intend to carry out the meat import law, which means there will be no meat imports in violation of that legislation. We will not grant any exceptions or waivers thereto. And I suspect there are a few dairy farmers in this group. How many are here? Aren't we lucky? They are all out working, and we are having a good time."", 'But let me say this: I intend to not change the present dairy import quotas, because I do not think we can, under the present circumstances, justify any increase in the quotas. And therefore, I think the dairy people will support the fine, firm, discerning action that Secretary Butz has recommended to me.', ""But let me add one other thing. You know, we as Americans like competition. I don't mind a German or a Dutchman or a Frenchman competing with me on an equal basis, but I will be doggone if I want the Government to subsidize the product he is trying to sell to the American people."", ""We will challenge him on the open fields, head-to-head, and we will do all right. Some of the foreign governments in Western Europe have been doing-by what they call countervailing duties--subsidizing dairy products in their countries. We won't stand for it, and if they are going to do that, we will challenge them, head-to-head."", 'Now, one final observation in the great field of agriculture: You produce tremendous cattle in this country, either cattle feeders or out on the range. I like it either way, but let me say this: We know that in some of the countries such as Australia, Argentina, and elsewhere, they have got tremendous numbers that are about to be exported, some perhaps to us.', 'In the meantime, Japan, Western Europe, Canada has imposed arbitrary limitations on the export of American products to those countries. I will say to you: They are .not going to limit our imports, and we are going to hold the line on exports to the United States.', 'Let me make one final observation and comment. Inflation, according to all the scorecards, is the biggest problem that faces most Americans. Eighty-three percent of the American people think this is the hardest, the toughest, the strongest issue in this great campaign, and I think I agree. As I travel around the country, I have listened to a lot of people; I talked with many. And it does bother people.', ""One of the root causes of inflation in America is the irresponsible fiscal policy of your Federal Government. We have to change it. Now, I don't believe that in good conscience I could stand here and say that every Republican is an inflation fighter and every Democrat is a spender. I could not honestly say that, and if I have any conscience, I want to be honest with you. But I will say that the tilt of spenders is in the opposition party, and the tilt of savers is in our party. So, as I travel around the country, I want savers not spenders elected to the Congress, so we can whip inflation."", 'Well, there is one other thing that I would like to mention before closing. You know, we have three great branches of this Government of ours. I fervently respect it as a lawyer, as a public servant, as a citizen. We have a strong President, supposedly, in the White House. We have a strong Congress, supposedly, in the legislative branch. We have a strong Supreme Court, supposedly, heading the judiciary system. They are equal, coequal branches of our Government. Our forefathers, some 200 years ago, put together this system that was to be so finely tuned that it would protect our freedom, give us the opportunity for participation, and also make it right for us as we moved on to pass through the years ahead.', 'How lucky we were they were right, they did it correctly. But now we face a challenge, and I do say it fight to all of you. There is the possibility that through apathy, you could end up in this next Congress with what I very pragmatically call a veto-proof Congress.', 'What does that mean? It totally disrupts and tears apart that finely tuned balance so that you no longer have a system of checks and balances. It means that one branch of our Federal Government will have a totally dominating, controlling impact on how your Government is run.', 'Wayne knows that. He and I have not always agreed on whether a veto ought to be sustained or not, or whether it ought to be done on a Democratic or Republican basis. But if you so distort the ratio in the Congress so that the Congress can totally override by a veto-proof Congress whatever a President decides, you have destroyed, you have upset, you have literally torn asunder a basic concept of what is good for America.', 'I don\'t want to come back here 2 years from now and say, ""I told you so,"" because I think you have more judgment. You are going to send Jim Johnson, Pete Dominick, and your good Governor, not only to Washington but to your State capital, to give you the kind of government that will be balanced, that will be right, that will have vision, that will have responsibility. It is the kind of government that is good for all of us, and I pray you will do your very best on November 5.']"
14,Gerald R. Ford ,"November 02, 1974","['Bob, Larry Winn, Garner Shriver, Keith Sebelius, Bob Bennett, other distinguished officeholders and candidates, wonderful Kansans: It is great to be here, despite the weather. I love you. Thank you.', 'You know, it just came to my attention as I was sitting here that I have been at a good many cities, communities in the last several months as I have tried to get out and meet people and talk to the American people. And we have had abnormally wonderful weather, until tonight. There were only two places where we had any rain--one in Tucson, Arizona, where they are never supposed to have any, and the other in my home of Grand Rapids, Michigan, when I went back for a homecoming last week.', 'Well, they were great in both Tucson and Grand Rapids, and you are superb here in Wichita. And I thank you for your warm, friendly, enthusiastic welcome.', 'As Bob was going through the process of making the introduction, I tried to think of how many times, how many places I have been in Kansas in the last 25-plus years as a Member of the House, as minority leader, as Vice President, and President.', ""And I wrote down, I think, most of them--I am sure I have missed some-but we went out to Great Bend. Wasn't that wonderful out there last year? It rained there, too, but that was all right. But I have been in Dodge City, and you know what they do to you in Dodge City. And I have been in Kansas City, Kansas, just recently, and I have been in Wichita here several times."", 'Well, I like Kansas. I like Kansas because of the people, but I have another good reason. It has been the home of one of the finest Presidents this Nation has ever known, the great statesman from Abilene, Dwight D. Eisenhower.', ""As you look at the history of Ike Eisenhower, you know that he set a standard of integrity, achievement that is everlasting, both to his country and to his State. Ike's record was unblemished. And I pledge to you that I will do, to the very best of my ability, to follow the path and the footsteps of that great American. If I can achieve just a bit of what he did, it will be worth every hour, every day of anything I can do in the years ahead."", 'I have another reason to enjoy coming to Kansas. The campaigns here always seem to have a little more fun than other States. You know, take the race for Governor. Somebody just told me the latest Republican slogan. It goes something like this: ""Let\'s put Bob Bennett in the driver\'s seat and keep Vern Miller in the trunk."" [Laughter and applause]', 'It is obvious from the reaction that you have a great candidate in Bob Bennett. His honesty, reliability, complete and total integrity--the only thing that Bob has ever covered up is his chin. [Laughter]', 'But speaking of things that, you know, get at a little different perspective once in a while, a long time ago when I was at the University of Michigan, I played center on the football team. And normally, of late at least, I have been getting some very stately and dignified introductions. But I can remember quite vividly an introduction I got about a month ago from an old teammate of mine. He was a quarterback. And in the process of the introduction he said, ""I played center on the same football team with Jerry Ford. I was a quarterback, but I want you to know I got a little different perspective of the President than most of you."" [Laughter]', 'Well, as I have looked at the great Republican slate that the party has put up here for the Senate, State offices, Congress, I must say that I am proud to be a Republican, and I hope you will all support it.', 'Having said that, let me add this as a postscript: I am not here just because of party labels. And as Bob said, I suspect there are many in this audience who are here who are Democrats, Independents, Republicans, but I am here to say a word of personal support for those individuals that I know and who I know, over the past years, have done a super job in working in the Congress for Kansas, for you, and for our country.', 'I come because of a personal affection that I have for everyone whose name I mentioned and a respect for a group of people that I have known since all of them came to the Congress, because I came before any one of them.', 'And I have seen them come. I have seen them grow. I have seen them assume great responsibilities far beyond that of others in comparable seniority.', 'Bob Dole, for example. I got to know Bob when he came and spent 8 years in the House of Representatives--all of it I was not the minority leader, but a part of it was, and the rest of the time I was a senior member of the House Committee on Appropriations. And I learned then, in that capacity, in these responsibilities, that Bob was smart, hard working, independent, and I can assure you that when he disagrees with you, it is firm; it is a little friendly, but it is firm.', 'He can disagree without being disagreeable. But what I want you to know is that his independence is predicated on conscience, and his support, when he can and does, is based on teamwork. You just could not get a better combination. So, if I were in Kansas, I know who I would vote for.', 'Now, I have talked about a personal relationship. Let me talk to you about a very pragmatic reason why you in Kansas should support Bob. Next year, with a new Congress, Bob will be the senior Republican member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture.', ""You in Kansas have a great State. I won't get into the argument of whether seniority is right or wrong. The fact of life is that in the Senate of the United States, they will keep that system, and Bob will be in that very influential position which has a great impact as far as your State is concerned."", ""But the combination of that responsibility on the one hand and a member of the Senate Finance Committee on the other, plus the added duty under a new setup of being on the Senate Budget Committee--I don't know how Bob is going to handle all these great responsibilities, except I know him, and I know he will do all three in a first-class way for Kansas and the country. So, as a pragmatic reason, you darned well ought to vote for Bob for the United States Senate."", 'I am told Bob is in for the political fight of his life. I suspect that is true. But Bob has been through those fights before. He did it in the service of his country. He has done it in one political campaign after another. And I say the test of the man is the achievement that he has accomplished.', 'And when I look at his record, believe me, you just could not do better.', 'So, I am here to help in any way I can to say to Kansans, whether they are Democrats, Republicans, or Independents: You ought to keep something that is as good as Bob is. And he is great.', 'I have also gotten to know all of your House Members extremely well. After all, it was part of my duty as the Republican minority leader for almost 10 years to try and corral votes to organize the minority, to do the best job we could despite the fact that we were outnumbered 240-something to 180-something.', 'The Kansas delegation always seems to have quality, and in Garner Shriver you have got one who has nothing but quality, and he comes from this great community, Wichita, in this great Congressional district. Garner deserves your support.', 'And let me say--again, going from what I would say would be maybe ideological reasons to pragmatic reasons--a little over a year ago, we had a fuel oil shortage. I can recall vividly in the process of allocating a shortage, the initial decision was to cut back the portion or the allocation for general aviation.', 'I was Vice President then. Larry Winn, Garner Shriver, Bob Dole, Joe Skubitz, Keith Sebelius--all of them came and knocked on my door. But the ones who came first, for good and sufficient reason, were Bob Dole and Garner Shriver. And the result was that you got a better break, and therefore, you ought to support them just on that ground, if not for any other reason.', ""Well, I don't have to say a lot about Larry Winn, Joe Skubitz, Keith Sebelius. They all have tremendous records. They have done a great job. We are not in their respective districts. You just ought to be darned proud of the Kansas delegation. They are responsible, and they are responsive. And how much better could you ask a delegation than to have that kind of a reputation?"", 'Now, let me speak, if I might, about some issues. Our biggest problem is twofold. Our biggest problem is to keep a strong economy, to whip the problems of inflation, to save the energy that we have, and develop plans and programs to produce more. That is our domestic issue.', 'On the other hand we have a major responsibility of maintaining the peace and building and broadening and expanding it, working with our allies, trying to expand our relationship with any potential adversaries.', 'Yes, those are serious problems, and I know some have predicted that the United States is in worse shape than some of our partners in Europe. Others say that they are far worse off than we. And then they make allegations that the free world as a whole--economically, militarily, diplomatically--is in serious trouble and that we should be cowed by and we should be fearful of those who have a different ideology or political philosophy.', 'Let me start out by making this one strong, categorical, firm statement: I have faith in America. We are going to make it, and our allies and our philosophy will prevail, both at home and abroad.', 'Now, we have to do this with the help and assistance of Republicans, Democrats, Independents. I know in some instances partisanship has interjected itself, become a principal element in some of the Congressional or senatorial or gubernatorial races.', ""Well, in the case of Bob Bennett, I don't know why it should, because you have a great candidate and he is going to win. I don't know why it should in the case of Bob Dole, because he has a proven record, both at home and abroad."", ""I don't know why it should in the case of Larry or Garner or Joe Skubitz or Keith or your fine new candidate, John Peterson.1 These are people who ought to be supported just on the basis of their background and experience and their dedication."", 'And I am not going to condemn a Democrat--because there are some good ones--but what I am concerned about is the kind of strength in programs and policies.', 'Let me take the problem of inflation and strengthening our economy, saving energy, 31-point program.', 'I think it is good. I believe it will meet the challenges that we face. One of the important ingredients is to hold down Federal spending. There are other parts of it, but I know that Bob Dole, Larry, Joe, Garner, and the others are the kind of people who will be most effective in holding down unnecessary spending, and you and I know that Federal spending of the magnitude that we have had over the last 10 or 15 years has been a significant cause of the inflation that we have today.', 'So, when you go into that voting booth next Tuesday, take a look at the voting record of those individuals on this issue. It is important to you if we are going to win this battle to save our economic system from the disasters of others historically and to give us the strength to meet the challenges of some of the weaknesses in our economy.', 'But let us turn, if I might, to the problem of building, strengthening, expanding peace. When I went to the Congress 26 years ago, or almost that, a great, great Democratic President working with a fine Republican Congress--the 80th--laid the foundation for the rehabilitation of Europe and the broadening of our free world throughout the total globe. It was started with the Greek-Turkish aid and the Marshall Plan and some of the other programs implemented by a military capability and strength that is aimed at deterrence, not at aggression.', 'And you in Wichita have a significant part of it with the Boeing operation here. Strength means peace, and weakness means war.', ""Well, anyhow, this combination of strength in the diplomatic field and the military has given to us in this great country, and to our allies, this kind of opportunity worldwide. And it has given us the opportunity to open the doors of greater and broader relationships with some of our potential adversaries, whether it is the Soviet Union or the People's Republic of China."", ""We, at this moment, have a unique opportunity, both at home and abroad, to do something to give us for the next decades--not one; two or maybe three--a brighter America and a better world. And when you look at this next election-and I don't mean in a partisan sense--what you have to decide is who, what Members of the Congress, what candidates are best qualified to give us strength here and vision and strength abroad."", 'I think you have got them in the kind of people I have mentioned, and I know you have because I have worked with them. I have seen them under pressure. I have seen them do things that might not have been popular at the moment because they were right. I have seen them just perform as wonderful representatives of the people of Kansas and the people of the United States.', 'One of the great men of this and any century, of course, was Winston Churchill. He led, as we all know, Great Britain through a period of far, far greater danger than anything we face today. But he, too, like myself, was an optimist. When many, many in Great Britain, and some of the free world back in those dark days in the late thirties had given up, Winston Churchill would not succumb to tyranny or the dark era or age of defeat.', 'Churchill still--and I can recall vividly because I was driving a car in, I think it was 1939, and I heard that wonderful blood, sweat, and tears speech. It was a great speech in an era, in a period, in a day of challenge to Britain.', 'Sometimes, maybe we ought to go back and listen to what Winston Churchill said in that hour of darkness for Britain and the free world. He said then, and not that precise day but on another occasion, and I quote: Do not let us speak of darker days. Let us speak of sterner days. There are not dark days. These are just great days.', 'I say to you in all sincerity, we are living in great days. We are going to have to work maybe a little harder and sacrifice just a bit more. But if we do our best and keep faith in ourselves and our values, America and all the other great things that we as a country stand for, our Nation will emerge stronger and better than ever.', 'I know there are some who wish to have the Government do something for everybody in massive amounts, but as they seek to promote these kinds of efforts in the short haul, I do not think they really forecast what the long pull means.', 'Let me put it this way: I think it is fair to say a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.', 'So, as I close my participation in this great campaign--and I have no apologies for traveling some 20,000 or more miles, being away from the Oval Office, seeing people as I did in Los Angeles, in Fresno, in Portland, Salt Lake, and here in Wichita, being in many other places for the last month or 6 weeks--I think the American people have the right to see their President and to have him discuss face-to-face with them his views and to get from them, by one means or another, their reactions, their views, their expressions. This is what I think America was built on.', 'The town hall concept may be a little out of date, but the town hall concept was good enough to take America through the Revolution and all the other trials and tribulations that followed. And if it was good enough in those days, I think it is good enough for a President to participate in 1974.', 'And so, as we move to that fateful day next Tuesday, not in a partisan sense but in an objective sense, I think we should all say a little prayer before we go into the sanctity of that voting booth where you and your neighbors will make some decisions that will have a great impact on you individually and your community, on your State, on your Nation, and some 4 billion people all over this great globe.', 'So, do the best yourself and find literally hundreds of others to get them to do their best under these circumstances.', 'I ask you to pray, for the benefit of our country and all mankind, and to do your duty.', 'Thank you very much.']"

You know, it brings back a good memory I have, going back to 1932--my first visit to Minnesota. [Laughter] I came up here with the University of Michigan football team and played against some of those great football players you turn out up here.', ""I was a sophomore. It was five below zero, and that stadium was very cold. I wasn't good enough to play very much, so I sat on the bench most of the time. I won't tell you the score, but 2 years later you made up for it and beat the devil out of us. [Laughter]"", 'Well, I think you know every visit I have ever made to Minnesota has been memorable, and it is without exceptions.', 'As I was getting off the plane at the Twin Cities International Airport last night, an amazing thing happened to me. Somebody asked me how to get to the State capital in St. Paul. What made it so amazing--it was Governor Anderson. [Laughter]', 'Obviously, I am pleased to be with such a tremendous gathering of Republicans here in the great State of Minnesota. And I understand from Chuck and the others that you have earned your way here in a tremendous effort in raising money for the party in your local communities.', ""I know, from my long, practical experience in trying to get reelected to the Congress, the heart and the soul of the Republican Party depends upon what all of you do in your local communities. So, I thank you. I just hope you don't have to give two-thirds of that money to the DFL [Democrat-Farmer-Labor Party of Minnesota] as well. [Laughter]"", 'But even more importantly, your individual achievements and accomplishments must give you a great deal of satisfaction, because you know what you have done will have an impact on the party locally, statewide, and nationally.', ""It has been my experience that there is a rising tide of enthusiasm and a great deal of optimism as far as the party's election prospects in November of 1976."", ""Frankly, as I travel around the country, I like what I see, and I am glad to see this same spirit here in Minnesota today. You've got a great chairman in Chuck Slocum. I talked to Chuck, as he indicated, after he was selected, and it is wonderful to meet him here today. He is a young man with energy, talent, plenty of talent to spare, and no time to waste. I know he will do as fine a job and good a job as Bob Brown did before him."", ""Now, if I could tick off what I think about these three gentlemen in the back here--[laughter]--I'm only going to tell you the good things I know about them. [Laughter]"", 'Of course, Al Quie has been one of my long-time and dearest friends in the Congress, and he is a great Member of the House of Representatives. Bill Frenzel, a fine, fine, upstanding, effective Member of the House of Representatives, who has done--and I am sure will do--a great job. And of course, Tom, a newcomer, but I have had some experience in seeing newcomers. Some come and some go, but I can feel in Tom that he is the kind of a person that is going to stay there a long time and do a good job.', ""I see among the group here today a number of your Republican State legislators from around the State, and I had the privilege of meeting many of them just before I came in here. They are the foundation of the Republican Party. The only problem you have is you need more and we need more in the State legislature after the next election. Let's be sure that happens."", ""Grassroots Republicans have traditionally been the real strength of the Republican Party. I don't care whether it is in Michigan, Minnesota, Iowa, or elsewhere, we as candidates can't get elected without the help and assistance of people like yourself at the grassroots level."", 'And I am convinced, as I see this group here, as I saw a great group in Iowa last night, that the Republican Party is on the upbeat, the upswing, and I just thank you for being among those who started when our fortunes were low and our prospects were bleak. You had enough dedication to principle, enough dedication to what is good for the country to start when things looked bad and are willing to work as hard as you have and be successful as evidenced by being here.', 'People in Minnesota, from my experience, are known for your pioneering spirit, your taste for a real challenge, and your ability to excel in a wide range of endeavors.', 'After talking with a number of your Members of Congress over a period of time, I know that you here in Minnesota are known as somewhat independentminded, and I am convinced that this year and next the Republican Party can appeal to the independent-minded voter here in Minnesota and across the country.', 'I am convinced--I am very strongly convinced--that the independent voter is ready for a fresh start. And that is exactly what we are prepared to offer them. The independent voter wants a sound and prosperous national economy without recession, without inflation, and so do we as Republicans.', ""The independent voter wants jobs for those who can work and sensible help for those who can't. The independent voter wants his country to achieve energy independence, and so do we."", 'This wonderful independent voter wants a good education, good housing, good health care, and good food for his family at prices he can afford, and so do we as Republicans.', 'The independent voter wants the scales of justice to balance the right of the criminal defendant with the rights of a law-abiding society, and so do we. Our crime program is aimed at domestic tranquillity, with deep concern for the victim of crime. And the independent voter wants that as well.', 'This independent voter--and more and more of them are appearing in every State of the Union--wants an America at peace with itself and throughout the world. But the independent voter knows that peace is too easily broken, and he knows that the surest guarantee of peace is a strong and ready national defense, and so do we.', 'The independent voter wants relief from higher and higher taxes, from more and more Government programs intruding into his business and into his private life, from bigger and bigger Federal budget deficits, and so do we.', 'And this above all, if I might, the independent voter wants America on the move again, moving in new directions with a vision of what can be, and so do we.', ""As we look toward the future, none of us can be certain and positive what is in store for us. But if we approach the future with faith in ourselves, in each other, and in our country, we need not fear the future's mysteries nor miss its opportunities."", 'We, as Republicans, and millions, millions of more throughout the country as independents, can help create a future bright with promise by our decision on election day, November 1976.', ""I have come here to this great meeting--and it is a great meeting--to ask your help in getting the message of commonsense government and hope for the future to the people of Minnesota. In one way or another, all of you have distinguished yourselves as enthusiastic supporters of the Republican Party. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here today. But now I am asking each and every one of you, all good Republicans, to go that extra mile for the party--indeed, if it is necessary, that extra thousand miles for the party. We have the principles, we have the programs and the people to do it."", ""And what's more, we have the year to do it--1976.

Thank you very much. [Laughter]', 'Let me thank George Parker, most affectionately known as the State pen. [Laughter] I enjoyed the fact that George met me at the airport along with Ody Fish, but most importantly it is great to be back in Milwaukee again, particularly on the day before a favorite American event, Halloween.', 'In fact, on the way in from the airport I asked Ody Fish if there was any special way people in Milwaukee and particularly Wisconsin celebrated trick or treat. Ody said, ""Well, for the treat we pretty much give out the traditional items like candy, apples, popcorn, things like that."" I said here in Wisconsin do you have any special treats--or tricks I should say. He said, ""Mr. President, only when the Democrats in the legislature work on the State budget."" [Laughter]', 'Ody said this is one year Wisconsin Republicans could have used Houdini. He was an expert on getting through locked doors.

Congratulations.', ""Since this is our Bicentennial year, let's remember that the history of the United States and the Republican Party are closely linked. No history of America can be written without that of our Republican Party. We have over 100 years of sound principle and good people, and we should be darn proud of it."", ""You here in Wisconsin know better than anyone for much of the groundwork of the Republican Party was laid right here in Ripon in 1854. Of course, I better mention Jackson, Michigan, for some very obvious reasons. [Laughter] But tonight I want to talk with you not only of our common heritage but our common journey into the future; not only of the proud principles of our Nation's past but of those upon which we must build for the future."", 'There is an increasing expression in America today that the beliefs and the values of our past are no longer relevant to our present nor to our future. Some suggest that America has seen its best days, that our decline has started, that the quality of life in America is sliding downhill, that our economy is on the skids, that the values most of us hold high are out and the new counter-culture is in.', 'To that I say, nonsense--with emphasis. And to those who would write a sell fulfilling prophesy of doom for this country, I say you are out of step with the vast majority of Americans, Americans who believe in this country and in themselves, and they are proud of our country and they are proud of themselves and their families.', 'Let me make certain there is no misunderstanding. I did not take the sacred oath of President to preside over the decline and fall of the United States of America. I totally reject the scenarios of pessimism. I have no sympathy with those who have a self-destruct attitude for this great country.', 'Instead, I look to the future of America, a future which will be built upon a proud past. I look to a nation that was not only able to conquer the challenges but provide its citizens with unmatched personal fulfillment by the year 2000.', 'Only a short 25 years from now, I see America, whose citizens reside in a community of peace with other nations; share the still highest standard of living in the world; live longer because killer diseases have been conquered and the quality of life enhanced; and enjoy opportunities and housing and education and jobs limited only by their personal initiatives and long-range objectives; experience individual liberties and freedoms which have not only been secured but expanded; whose citizens share a national will and spirit which is still climbing as this Nation moves well into its third century.', 'To make this vision come true, we must return government to sound, responsible Republican principles. And we will. We must elect to your State and local offices and to the Congress responsive and responsible Republican candidates who believe as we do and who share our collective objectives.', 'The battlelines for 1976 are being drawn between these opposing forces:', 'Between those who believe in fiscal responsibility and those who believe every problem will go away if we just threw enough tax money at it.', 'Between those who believe in a strong national defense is the best insurance of peace and those who would spend your tax money instead for controversial social experiments.', 'Between those who believe in local control over local problems and those who believe Uncle Sam should help solve all problems individually and collectively.', 'Between those who believe that American business should be unshackled from Government overregulation so it can expand the economy and create jobs and those who believe Federal papershufflers know what is best for America and for its business community.', ""Between those who believe in the expansion of individual freedom and liberty and those who believe in big government and that it should direct people's lives. That is a fundamental issue."", ""Let me emphasize 1976 is more than an election year. It is also a year of decision for all Republicans. It is the Republican Party's golden opportunity to prove to all that it has the strength to survive setbacks, the resolution to rouse the Nation's greatness, and the will to win elections. We can do it, and we will do it."", 'But to make this proof secure, we Republicans must make some practical changes in our political ways; not in principles, but in approaches.', ""We must discard the attitude of exclusiveness that has kept the Republican Party's door closed while we make speeches about keeping it open. We must invite into our ranks all who care about the great country in which we live and all who share our goals enough to work through the Republican Party to achieve them."", 'We must build, step by step, a party that works year round and not just at election time. Most important, we must emphasize our differences with Democrats rather than with each other. We must concentrate on winning elections instead of arguments.', 'As we look toward 1976---and what a year to have before us--the apathy and the cynicism which have overtaken some Americans must be overcome by offering candidates of outstanding ability and rock-hard integrity.', 'We must develop programs that are forward looking and problemsolving, and we must elect a Congress that will carry them out, and we will.', ""In Bill Steiger and Bob Kasten you have got quality, but we need a lot more quantity from Wisconsin. Isn't that right?"", ""I proposed to the 94th Congress--that is the one in session now, or I guess it is in session--[laughter]--some people say it has been more out of session than in, but I wouldn't allege that--but I proposed to the 94th Congress a permanent annual cut in your Federal tax bill of $28 billion and a corresponding cut in the growth of Federal spending of the same amount."", 'But all I get, so far, from this Democrat-dominated, ""Can\'t Do Congress"" is it can\'t be done. I say it can, it will, and it must be done this year. If this Congress isn\'t capable of doing the job, let\'s elect a Republican Congress that can and will.', ""America's vitality, its prosperity have been sapped by the irresponsible spending of this Congress, which is controlled 2 to 1 by the Democrats, and a previous Congress, which has been controlled by Democrats for 38 out of the last 42 years."", 'I might add, parenthetically, for 33 out of those 38 years, there have been deficits which have run up the cost of living and run down the value of the dollars that you earn by the sweat of your brow.', 'Under the Democratic spenders, the Federal budget for the first time in our history topped $100 billion in 1962. It doubled to $200 billion 8 years later and will more than double again to $423 billion in this coming fiscal year unless we get some action.', ""Let me emphasize, the $28 billion reduction in taxes which I proposed must be accompanied by equally substantial cuts in the growth of Federal spending. This means the spending ceiling must be $395 billion. That is adequate to meet our needs both at home and abroad, and we must get that ceiling, period. We will keep a scorecard on those that don't vote for it."", 'You know that under the laws Democratic Congresses have already written-they are piled high in statute books--without a single new appropriation or program, and despite everything I can do as President by vetoing further increases, our Federal expenditures will increase next year by $50 billion. That is just growth.', 'I was in California the other day, and the growth in the Federal budget in 12 months is five times the annual budget of the State of California. Something is wrong.', ""The Democrats in Congress don't like my vetoes, but these vetoes have already saved taxpayers some $6½ billion. I will go on vetoing unwise, unnecessary spending bills again and again and again and again. I will do it as long as it saves you money, but more importantly, it saves our Nation's future, and that is the crux of the battle we are facing at the present time."", 'What concerns me most is what I see as government without consent, the increasing encroachment of government in our lives and in our future, the irresponsible government action on the local as well as the national level.', ""Let's make sure we understand each other. It is neither responsible nor compassionate to spend a city or a nation into bankruptcy."", 'I am going to say this quietly--[laughter]--I can assure you this President will never allow the doors of the United States Treasury to be flung open to every city with a hole in its fiscal pocket.', 'I suspect some of you know I spoke to this problem yesterday. I said that if the Federal Government goes on spending more than it has, providing more benefits and services than it can pay for, then a day of reckoning will ultimately come to Washington and to our entire country just as it has to New York City. And tonight let me ask each of you and all of you collectively the same ominous question I asked in Washington little over 24 hours ago. When that day of reckoning comes, who will bail out the United States?', ""Believe me, it is neither responsible nor compassionate to erode the value of people's hard-earned money through inflation by piling Government spending on spending, program on program without the revenues to pay for them. This is not compassion; this is pure and simple irresponsibility."", ""I know it, you know it, and 214 million Americans know it through the length and the breadth of this great country. And by this time next year we should make darn sure every responsible voter knows who did it and who didn't do it."", 'The message of the Republican Party and what it stands for must be carried to all of the American people. We must let people know that this is the party of openness, the Republican Party, an open party that insists on open government. And that is precisely what you are doing here in Wisconsin, and I congratulate your legislative leaders. For the young and old, rich and poor, black and white, Independents, and discerning, and, yes, deserted Democrats--for all of these Americans and more, we have something in this great party to offer them.', ""We are the party of principles, not pessimism; the party of answers and solutions, not the disseminators of doubt and despair; the party of reason, responsibility, and restraint, not the party that purveys promises which can't be kept or programs which can't be achieved."", 'Responsibility--that is the key word, one we equate with Republicanism, and we have a record on this point that Republicans can stand on with pride.', 'But we are not only a party of principles, we are a party of people. And this magnificent demonstration here tonight proves it beyond any question. You can be missionaries in every one of the 71 counties in the great State of Wisconsin. You can say with conviction that principles can be converted into action only when they are supported by a majority of the people.', 'We must bring people and principles together across our land in Wisconsin and 49 other States. That is the answer to the pessimists, the doom pushers of today. We believe in people, and we believe in principles.', ""The Republican Party's goal is to unite the American people in the principles that made our Nation great over a period of almost 200 years."", ""In the first hundred years of our Nation's history, we developed a form of government that provided more liberty, more opportunity for more people than any nation in the history of mankind."", ""In the second hundred years of our Nation's history, we developed an industrial and agricultural capacity unmatched in the history of this great globe."", 'In our third century, we must dedicate ourselves to expanding the opportunity for freedom and liberty, individuality, yes, and the Republican Party can be the mechanism for that.', 'In 1976, together we can celebrate a great victory with those principles and those people, a joint victory--not merely for the party, believe me, but for the people of the United States.', 'Thank you very much.']"

We can and will offer hope to all segments of our society--the poor, the rich, the handicapped. We will do a job that will make everybody proud to be an American and proud of America.', 'In the political arena in which we are operating, we can talk about the headway we have made and the expectations that are down the road, but we know from past experience that a good organization such as you have here, that you are all a part of, will make a meaningful difference, whether it is in New Hampshire or Massachusetts or Florida or any one of the other States where we either have a primary or whether we have a convention.', 'This is a group that I am proud of.

But whether or not you help in that regard, you have already given me great, great encouragement by showing what Americans can do.', 'In recent years, when many leaders of communities, large and small, voiced despair and turned to the Federal Government to open its gates to solve local problems, the Gate City opened its gates to traditional Yankee initiative. You built a showcase of industrial growth, new jobs, new homes, new hopes for the thousands of new residents. Your vigorous growth helps to tell the Nashua story.', 'Your community is highly productive and has generated many, many new jobs. Your .story is in the finest American tradition of how local people can solve local problems, of how individuals can respond to possibilities rather than surrender to pessimism, and how this is not only the State of the Great Stone Face but of granite fortitude and granite character.', 'All Americans in all 48 or 49 other States can learn from your example of the ""can do"" spirit, and I congratulate you for it.', 'As you join in the national celebration of our Bicentennial, we are reminded by the historical archives in Washington that New Hampshire was a ""can do"" State from the very, very beginning.', ""The First New Hampshire Regiment fought from the first repulse of the British on Bunker Hill. Through Valley Forge and Trenton to the surrender at Yorktown, your regiment had the longest service record of any unit in George Washington's army, a total of 8 years and 8 months in strong, tough, military action."", 'The first warship to fly the American flag, the Ranger, commanded by John Paul Jones, was built in your great shipyard at Portsmouth, which we are not going to close.', 'If any State can take pride in the Bicentennial, it is New Hampshire. And if any community can take pride in the achievements of this Bicentennial Year, it is Greater Nashua, and I salute you for your thriving enterprise and individual initiative as you day by day and month by month build for the future.', ""What I like most about the Nashua story is that you expose the Nation's pessimists as exemplified in that fable about Chicken Little. You may recall Chicken Little was hit on the head by a single acorn and then ran around telling everybody that the sky was falling."", 'The fact is that America has been hit on the head by some very heavy acorns in recent years and recent months--recessionary acorns, inflationary acorns, unemployment acorns, energy acorns.', 'Just a year ago, I heard many fearful outcries that we needed massive Federal programs spending billions and billions of dollars to save the economy, that a terrible depression was descending upon us, that bread was going to $1 a loaf, and that unemployment lines would only get longer and longer and longer.', 'But I was convinced that we had to take consistent and balanced action, neither too much on the one hand or too little on the other, the right steps and not the wrong steps. I knew that measures taken in panic would be counterproductive. The proper response would prove, as has been established, that our Nation is resilient, resourceful, and very, very sound, and we should be very proud of it.', 'Make no mistake, things were not good this time last year. Nineteen hundred and seventy-five was the year of very hard decisions and very difficult compromises, but it was also a year of new realism that taught us something--something important about America. It restored common sense and the same kind of discipline that kept the First New Hampshire Regiment in the line through Valley Forge to final victory.', 'The economic discipline we have maintained is justified by the statistics released yesterday. They reported that the unemployment rate just took the sharpest monthly drop in over 17 years.', 'The number of unemployed is today the smallest since December 1974. Employment has increased by 2.1 million since last March, at the bottom of the recession. Over 86.2 million Americans are now at work. Better than 92 percent of the work force is actually gainfully employed.', 'We are today headed not only in a new direction but in the right direction. It is the right direction because we follow the 200-year-old wisdom that national problemsolving requires far more than a central government which promises too much and delivers far too little.', 'A free society, according to Jefferson and Adams, depended upon qualities that they called ""republican virtues""--civic virtue, the ethic of honest work, and local control by local people.', 'During the recent years of very rapid change, more and more people looked to Washington to solve local problems. Too much was expected; too much was promised. Some citizens felt automatically entitled to a constantly rising living standard without regard to their own efforts, to their individual productivity, or their personal contribution to the community and to the economy.', ""Freedom is today misinterpreted by too many to mean the instant equalization of everyone's social and economic situation at the public expense through the machinery of the Federal Government."", 'I pledge to you today that my administration will strive to deliver everything we promise. I will never promise more than I can deliver.', 'The false premises and false promises of years of social experimentation distorted the Federal system. Power was drained away from Nashua, from New Hampshire, and from every community and every State to an increasing centralized Federal Government--always bigger, always more powerful, but not always more efficient nor more responsive nor more protective of our traditional freedoms.', 'The patriots who built America understood that poverty is abolished by economic growth, not by government-imposed redistribution of money. They knew that only initiative and work could create a society with economic prosperity and political participation by everyone.', 'They knew that local problems are better understood and solved by local people rather than by the bureaus and agencies of a distant, impersonal central government. They knew that the pendulum of power must never swing too far away from the people in every one of the 50 States.', ""If this year's Bicentennial is to be more than a historic pageantry, we must restore to the people more power to decide how their taxes are spent, how they live, how they work, how they fight crime, and how their children go to school. Should the Bicentennial achieve nothing else, this alone would be a triumph for our heritage."", ""Despite our recent gains in employment, too many people who want jobs still can't find them. Five out of six American jobs are in private business and private industry."", 'I, therefore, am deeply concerned by the difficulties of various industries like the shoe factories in New Hampshire. The Trade Act of 1974, which I supported as Vice President and signed into law as President, provides the mechanism, now activated, to assure that our American shoe factories receive fair treatment. I want such traditional American factories to have access to every remedy provided by law and a full say in their own destiny.', 'To create more jobs, there must also be a greater incentive to invest without the strangulation of Federal taxation and redtape. I am seeking from the Congress a reduction in the growth of Federal spending, accompanied--and this is crucial--by a reduction of Federal taxes.', 'And let me reemphasize, if I might, we cannot have an honest bona fide tax reduction unless we put a legitimate restraint on the growth in Federal spending. But, if we are firm in our desire to restrain the growth of Federal spending-which has been at the rate of about 11 percent per year for the last 10 years--if we just cut that growth in half to 5 to 5½ percent, we cannot only balance our budget in 3 years, but we can have an additional tax reduction over and above the one that I hope and trust will be extended beyond June 30, 1976.', 'Let me add one or two other features about taxes. My job creation tax incentives submitted to the Congress this year would speed up plant expansion and facilitate the purchase of millions and millions of dollars of new equipment. These incentives would concentrate in areas of unemployment in the next 12 months. We must create the economic climate in America to generate productive, permanent, and private jobs rather than temporary, make-work, inflationary, government-sponsored jobs.', 'This weekend we have new evidence that we are moving quite dramatically in the right direction. The latest employment figures released on Friday show 800,000 more people at work in the month of January than in the month before. The unemployment rate is down from 8.3 to 7.8. This is the largest reduction in percentage since 1960. We have regained 96 percent of the jobs lost to the recession, and most of it has come in the private sector, where the greatest opportunity exists for future improvement.', 'The Nashua Telegraph is correct in saying editorially that I want to create ""concrete and lasting jobs in the private sector rather than manufacturing styrofoam cutouts which the public sector would have to prop up artificially with public funds.""', 'I appreciate that dramatic description of what some people want to do, but which I categorically resist, and I thank Herin Pouliot1 and the Nashua Telegraph for those, I think, very perceptive words. I might add with a postscript, it was a very nice editorial.', 'I also strongly believe--and have for some time--tax changes to encourage people to invest in their own future and that of America. I want to give moderate-income families tax deductions or tax deferrals when they make long-term investments in common stock. I want as many people as possible in this great country to be partners, however modestly, in the growth and the strength of America.', 'We must also preserve the vigor and the continuity of the family-owned small business and family farm. These enterprises are bastions of the real American values. And I will submit to the Congress the estate tax legislative changes to assure that a family business and a family farm can be handed down from one generation to another. Too much labor and too much love go into these enterprises for them to be sold to pay Federal taxes.', 'Those who invest in new enterprises invest in American progress and in jobs for their fellow citizens. An example of job creation is the brewery opened here in 1970. It represents an initial investment of some $40 million and now employs, as I understand it, some 400 people.', ""But I hope no one will contend that the cure for unemployment is to build Government breweries to brew Government beer. Quite honestly, I don't think the United States Government could make beer for less than $50 a six-pack. [Laughter]"", 'A very necessary condition for the success of your brewery and all of your other industries is the entrepreneur spirit. This cannot be achieved if the Government is to go on piling regulation upon regulation and stringing redtape over redtape and assessing tax after tax to cover new Government spending. Such policies impose an inflationary burden on business as well as the consumer, and I will never lead this Nation down that road of stagnation.', ""The people are as fed up with the petty tyranny of Federal regulations today as when patriots defied the tax collectors over 200 years ago and threw the tea into the 'Boston Harbor."", ""Some of you, I am sure, have experienced serious difficulty at the not always tender hands of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. I know some of you would like to throw OSHA into the ocean. In fact, some of you couldn't be more upset with OSHA if Ron Nessen was running it. [Laughter]"", 'I have studied, to be frank and honest with you, some very valid complaints about OSHA and concluded that while everyone is for safe and healthy working conditions, many are troubled by the manner in which this objective is sought.', 'Congress wrote the law, and we must obey it. However, under my authority as President, I have appointed a new director with specific instructions to deal with citizens as friends, not as enemies. I will not tolerate the unnecessary and unjustified harassment of citizens. If this does not stop, I want you to let me know.', 'Another indication that we are moving on the right track is the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, which I proposed to the Congress last year and which I was pleased to sign into law several days ago. It upgrades railroad facilities in a way that will keep our recovery rolling. Your State is eligible for several millions of dollars to improve rail service under this act, and I think this is all to the good, not only for New Hampshire but for the Nation as a whole.', 'I am deeply concerned by an issue which has a particular impact on older Americans, now retired, who have always paid their own way. I refer to medical costs involving senior citizens and their families who suffer ruinous expenses because of an extended hospital and nursing home care. I have, therefore, proposed health insurance to cover any catastrophic illnesses suffered by anyone covered by Medicare.', ""I think most of us in our daily lives over the years have known an individual or known a family where there was a catastrophic illness that went on and on and on with the costs and expenses which are impossible to bear. We have to do something about this' Therefore, under the proposal that I have suggested, after reaching the age of 65, no person will have to pay more than $500 a year for hospital or nursing home care, nor more than $250 for doctor bills in any one year."", 'But let me add this. While we must help those who need it most--and in the United States in this category there are roughly 3 million--we cannot realistically afford federally dictated national health insurance providing full coverage for all 215 million Americans. It is not only the cost, but as we look around the world, the experience of other countries raises questions about the quality as well as the cost of such plans.', 'In another most important area, the time is long, long overdue for Congress to renew general revenue sharing for the next 5 years. I have asked Congress some 10 months ago to act on this legislation to bring power back to the people.', ""General revenue sharing is a program that I think best exemplifies responsive federalism. It provides assistance to State and local units of government with a minimum of redtape and administrative expense. It returns Federal dollars to your community or to your State. It permits local officials elected by you in your respective townships or communities to set priorities and to plan ahead to meet local needs, and it doesn't require you to raise local taxes."", 'From the beginning of general revenue sharing in 1972, which was a real breakthrough, the projected total for 1976--the Nashua share will be between $4.5 million and $5 million. Mayor Sullivan, you know how important it is.', 'The sums expended in this community, according to the wishes of your local officials, provided as of last year over $1.6 million for public safety, including police and fire departments, over $1.1 million for environmental protection, over $200,000 for health, and other sums involving social services for the aged and for the poor. Almost $5.2 million more would be returned to this growing, this vigorous community by 1982 under the proposed extension of the legislation if Congress will move.', 'From the beginning in 1972 through the projected total for 1976, New Hampshire will receive $96 million. Under the program proposed, which I hope Congress will act upon, another $125 million of your tax dollars would come back to New Hampshire between 1977 and 1982.', 'For many reasons--the people I have met here tonight, the people I have met during the day--I am as optimistic about Nashua and its future as you are. I am equally optimistic about the future of New Hampshire, in fact all of New England, and I must add very quickly, all of our 50 States and 215 million Americans.', 'Let no exaggeration of inflation or unemployment blind us to the genuine progress we have achieved within the last year. Our economy is steadily growing stronger. Our policies are designed to keep us on a very steady and progressively better course. The course is set for a new balance in the relationship between the individual on the one hand and the Government on the other, a balance that favors greater individual freedom and self-reliance.', 'We must also seek a new balance that favors greater responsibility and freedoms for our State and local units of government. We must have a new balance between spending on domestic programs and spending on defense, a balance that ensures we will fully meet our obligations to the needy while we are also protecting our security in a world that is still hostile to freedom.', 'The genius of America is its incredible ability to improve the lives of its citizens through a unique combination of governmental and free citizen activity.', 'It took many years of excessive spending, combined with a fourfold increase in international oil prices, to create the economic difficulties of 1974 and 1975. It will take several years of sound policies and reasoned restraint to restore sustained, noninflationary growth.', 'I will not make promises which I know and you know cannot be kept. We must restore full strength to our economy as quickly as we possibly can, but in so doing, we must not reignite the fires of inflation.', 'Escalating inflation, as we all know, makes steady growth and full employment totally impossible. It breeds instant instability and disruption.', ""I strongly reject the view that the only way to reduce unemployment is to accept chronic inflation or rigid controls. We certainly don't want either. Inflation and unemployment are not opposites, but actually related symptoms."", 'The way to treat the disease instead of these symptoms is by the use of proven remedies prescribed throughout New Hampshire--the medicine of initiative, enterprise, investment, development, growth, and just plain common sense taken together with the therapy of good hard work.', 'Yes, we see the results. Your unemployment is lower than many other areas of the Nation. You must be doing many things that are right here. I believe in the example that you hold forth, the living demonstration of what people can do to determine their own fate.', ""America's spirit is alive and vigorous here in Nashua, and America's spirit is alive and vigorous because of communities like Nashua. Never let that spirit die so we can continue to be proud to be Americans and proud of America."", 'Thank you very much.']"
19,Gerald R. Ford ,"February 14, 1976","['Thank you very, very much, Joel, Lou, and all the distinguished public officials, all of you wonderful youngsters and oldsters, and everybody else:', 'We get the combination of energy from these young people and the real experience and enthusiasm from all the rest of you--we just have to win. We are bound to win.', 'We have had, as Joel said and as Lou indicated, a wonderful reception from the time we landed in Orlando. And this group here is another indication-despite what some of the skeptics have said--that we not only have the numbers but we have the talent, we have the enthusiasm. Our organization is good, and we are going to win with them.', 'The nicest thing for a candidate to have--and I think Lou and the others would agree with me-is to find when the chips are down, when the going, in the minds of some, is at least rough, that all of your old friends from a good many years back or some of your new acquaintances or some of the neighbors that you lived next to or people you went to school with or were associated with in business, come to help. And as I walked through this wonderful crowd this morning, I must admit, 50 people fitted into one category or another that were friends of the past or newly made acquaintances.', 'This is what makes a candidate feel good, because of their feeling of closeness and their feeling of knowledge about whether you are good or bad. And I want to thank not only all of those old friends but to thank all of you who have done so much and are so important in this crucial campaign.', 'Let me just take a minute to talk about what has happened in the last 18 months. About 18 months ago, the burden fell on me to become President of the United States under very difficult circumstances. I think we have made a tremendous amount of progress. We have restored the public faith in the responsibilities of the Oval Office.', 'But as I look back in that month of August of 1974--what were the circumstances? We were suffering as a nation from inflation of over 12 percent. We were on the brink of a very serious economic recession. Our allies abroad had some fear and apprehension as to whether or not a new President could rally the American people and contribute to the growing and essential strength of our alliances abroad.', 'Instead of panicking, we took a firm, steady, realistic, commonsense course of action. And the net result is we have made tremendous progress. And we are not coming up with any quick-fixes that look good on paper, but burn up about as quickly as it possibly could.', 'So here we are in February of 1976, roughly 18 months after those circumstances faced us squarely in our eye. I would like to add a little extra comment. I know from the mountains of mail that I have received and Betty has received over this 18 months, we have had the prayers of young people and old people. We have had the prayers of the American people, and that has been extremely helpful to us. And we thank all of those who were kind enough and thoughtful enough under those circumstances.', 'But here we are in February of 1976, and the skies, all of a sudden, seem to be opening up and brightening considerably and they are that way because we have done the right thing. We are coming out of the depression. Employment is going up. Since March of last year we have added 2,100,000 more jobs. We regained 96 percent of the jobs lost during the recession. The unemployment trend is down, and it is going down.', 'We had some encouraging news just yesterday in two respects. One, the Wholesale Price Index, which is the basis of the Consumer Price Index--jr you get that under control, you have got a great big handle on trying to cut back the cost of living for the consumer. For the month of January there was no increase in the Wholesale Price Index. The month before there was a 1.6 drop. The month before, it was zero, so we are really doing something effective in the Wholesale Price Index. And that will have a beneficial impact for young and old and people in every one of our 50 States.', 'But to create jobs we have to have our economy really moving. And, again yesterday, we got some excellent news--that industrial production was up again.', 'So as we look across the domestic spectrum, I find a great reason for encouragement, even more so than I tried to say during the State of the Union Message about a month ago. But it does not do us much good to get things straightened out and problems corrected at home unless we are sure that our national security is in the right direction.', 'I said last week, and I reiterate it here--the policy of this administration is one of peace through strength. I submitted in January the largest defense budget, I think, in the history of the United States--$112.7 billion. This is the first real step to make certain that we have not only the capability to deter war but the capability to make certain that our security is secure.', 'But more importantly, we are making the right kind of headway because we are strong in our reestablishment of our alliances abroad. I have had some excellent personal contacts with the heads of government in Britain, in France, and West Germany and other Western European countries. Today, the NATO alliance is in the best shape it has been since its inception.', 'It is important that we keep a strong partner and many friendships in the Pacific. Our relations with Japan today are the best they have ever been. That is a bulwark of strength in that vast ocean area.', 'At the same time, we can look with great pride at what has been accomplished in the Middle East. We have moved forward to a just and permanent peace in the Middle East. Why? Because the Israelis trusted us and the Egyptians trusted us. And it is the trust they have in us which convinced them that they could move toward a settlement of some of their differences. This is the result of America being strong and America being trusted.', ""But we do face some adversaries around the globe. We face the People's Republic of China. It is important that we continue the negotiations and the open relations that we have with them. We recognize that their ideology, their political philosophy, is totally different from ours, but you can't ignore 800 million people. And we will deal with them in a way that we benefit and in a way that is good for the world as a whole."", 'We face the problem of dealing with the Soviet Union. Let me say one thing categorically. I am a good Yankee trader and we are not going to get out-traded in dealing with the Soviet Union.', 'But I think it is important, as we negotiate with the old traditions of American Yankee traders, to recognize that if we can put a cap on the nuclear arms race and push back the vast expenditures for more and more and more nuclear arms, it is in the best interest of all of us. We will keep our powder dry, but we are going to be darn sure that that agreement, if it comes about, is in our interest and in the interest of world peace as a whole.', ""I don't think it is in the best interest for us to do two things: One, to increase the proliferation of nuclear arms all over the world. And I don't think it is in the best interest of the world to deal in this area with your finger on the trigger. I think it is better to be strong and keep your powder dry."", 'Now let me close with just one final comment. I reiterate my appreciation for your all being here. I know how hard you have worked and I know how much of an impact you have had. We have about a month to go. What we do in the weeks ahead, the days before us, is vitally important. The reception we have received here in Florida has been tremendous and I am deeply grateful, but campaigns are won, and this kind of a campaign will be won, by what all of you do and the policies that we pursue.', 'We are going to try, as we move ahead in the policy decisions of this administration, to have this kind of a balance. I want a balance between the taxpayer on the one hand and the recipient of Federal assistance on the other. I want a balance between the private sector and the government sector. I want a balance between the Federal Government and the State government and local units of government. It is vitally important that we have that balance. I want to free the individual from as much government control as possible', 'I will make one statement that sort of puts all of my philosophy in a very simple sentence. I say it often because I believe it. Some of you may have heard it, but it wraps it all up: A government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.', 'We want that balance. We want honest government. We want strong government. We want fair government.', 'And let me conclude with this final comment--as we move ahead, and we are moving ahead both at home and abroad, I get prouder and prouder of the fact that I am an American, and I get prouder and prouder of America. And I know you do, too.', 'Thank you.']"

And I hope that we will all be hearing from you on Tuesday the 24th.', 'THE PRESIDENT. Let me take just a minute or two, if I could, to tell you what has happened in the last 18 months. Eighteen months ago we were faced as a nation with a very difficult period of time. We were faced with very high inflation of 12 percent or more; we were on the brink of a very serious economic recession; we had some problems worldwide. Our allies and adversaries were not sure what the United .States was going to do, how we were going to handle our affairs.', 'But I think in the last 18 months the American people have had a restoration in better faith in their government and I think the credit is primarily due to 215 million Americans. And their faith has made the job that I try to do for them a great deal easier. And I thank all of you in New Hampshire, and particularly those here, for that faith which has made it so much easier for me to try and do a better job for all of us.', 'Now let me take a minute to tell you where we are. Things are a lot better in America, but they are not as good as they are going to be. Unemployment is going down; employment is going up. Real wages are increasing. The rate of inflation has been cut in half. And we got some excellent news this morning which shows that the cost-of-living rate of increase has declined and we making real headway against some very tough and difficult circumstances.', 'As we look at home I think the bitterness that existed some 2 years ago or more has actually been dissipated and all Americans, whether they are Democrat or Republican or Independent, are pulling together basically to make this the kind of a country that we all want.', 'As I walked in and shook hands with many, many people I saw some older people and some younger people. We owe a great deal to the older people in this country. They took this Nation through the most difficult times economically in the thirties and they met the challenge of World War II as well as World War I. And our country is better off because of their sacrifices and their capability to do a first-class job.', 'And then I saw some younger people who are the beneficiaries and they have a great responsibility in America--the responsibility to carry on and do for their children what their parents and grandparents did for them.', ""But I have a lot of faith in young people. They are better educated I think, they have more opportunities to see the country and to see the world, and the net result is America's young people are going to carry the torch for freedom as well if not better than any previous generations."", 'But now we have got some big decisions to make, not only in New Hampshire but elsewhere throughout the country. Then, of course, the big final decision on November 2. I am here and Betty is with me because we want your help on next Tuesday. We can do a better job for you if you can help us. And we pledge to you the same honest, frank, candid efforts that we made in the past, which I think is the way our country ought to operate--frankness and candor and forthrightness between a President and the American people and between them and him.', 'I thank you for your consideration.

We have had, as I think all of you recognize, a very difficult time economically for the last 12 to 18 months. When I became President inflation was over 12 percent. Unemployment was starting to go up; employment was starting to go down. We really faced a very serious crisis in America. We didn't panic. The American people responded very well. We have had the right policies."", ""I can't help but refer to something I read in one of the Boston newspapers this morning which, I think, indicates we are on the way to a real economic recovery--not a quick fix, not a phony, but a good, solid economic recovery, and that is what we want. We want permanent jobs for people with an opportunity to make their way up the ladder of success and this is the way to do it-the way we are doing it."", 'But two outstanding people in Government made some reports yesterday-Alan Greenspan and Dr. Arthur Burns--and the headline says: ""Greenspan and Burns Optimistic About The Pace of Recovery."" I would expect them to be responsive because, after all, I think they are nonpartisan, nonpolitical, and they are both what you would call economists who have got a real objective look at things. So, they look at the figures and know we are going in the right direction.', 'But I couldn\'t help but read part of the second paragraph. Let me read it to you--we have really got a convert--and here is what it says: ""They were joined by U.S. Senator Hubert Humphrey, Democrat of Minnesota, who said at a Joint Economic Committee hearing, and I quote, am a little more bullish on the economy than most people I listen to.\' ""And he must have been listening to Greenspan and Burns.

If you are unemployed it bothers you--probably more so if you are unemployed. But we got an announcement on the Consumer Price Index this morning. It showed it was at .4 percent, which means that on the basis of that, if you annualize it all year long it is less than 5 percent per year. Bear in mind that 18 months ago it was 12 percent or more so we can say we are on the right path and we are getting results and this is what the American people want.', 'As long as you work at the job and you are doing the right thing and you produce, that is what the American people want and that is what we are doing, and that is why we are going to win with all your wonderful help.', 'Thank you very, very much.']"

And we are the one country in. this whole globe that has more freedom than any place else, any place else, and we should be thankful.', 'But in the process of having freedom, it means you have to do something to protect it, to save it, to expand it, to make it more available for more people. I have great faith that 215 million Americans--those in Lantana, Lake Worth, and elsewhere--are going to stand tall and strong and keep moving forward to protect what we have but to help other people too.', 'I have to say goodby now, and I hate to leave Lantana, but let me add, if I might, as I have shaken many hands and looked in many eyes and heard from many people right on this street, I have a feeling that I have a friend or two here.', ""I think friendship is the greatest thing, and may I ask for your help and support on March 9?

It is freedom from an oppressive, irresponsible, inconsiderate government. It is freedom from the fear of war, and it is great power for peace and a good healthy economy.', 'Let me now take a minute and say in a few words what I think all of us-Democrats, Republicans, Independents, or otherwise--ought to be thinking about. We want an America that gives to everybody not only freedom but the responsibility that goes with freedom. We want a country where government is responsive to you, each and every one of you. We want an opportunity for a job for everybody that wants to work. We want an economy that is free from the ravages of inflation. And we want a Defense Department that is strong enough to make certain, to make sure, that this country deters war and is strong enough to protect us against any aggression.', 'Listen very closely.

If you look at that picture most carefully, you will find that some of the faces in that picture are not clearly drawn out, are not identifiable. And people come into the Oval Office, and as I walk out with them, oftentimes they will stop and look at that picture and they will say, ""Why isn\'t that individual identifiable? Why hasn\'t his face been clearly drawn?""', ""Let me tell you the answer. I think that the portrait painter decided that those men who signed the Declaration of Independence weren't the only people who were going to make America free and strong. They knew they had that great belief and feeling that there would be millions and millions of other people who would come along and would continue the struggle for freedom, and that they were only a small part of it."", 'What I am really saying is, as I look across this great crowd, see some people I know and some I want to get to know, I know that everybody in this crowd here this afternoon wants to be a part of that crusade for freedom in the United States of America.', ""That freedom means, as I said at the outset, freedom from unemployment, inflation, freedom from a government that doesn't take into consideration your legitimate needs and wants, freedom from the fear of war, but most of all a freedom of the soul and the heart, a freedom to pray and to speak and to write as only people can do in a free country."", 'Now let me close with this final comment. I was in Florida several weeks ago. I have been here many, many times because I love Florida, but in the trip that was several weeks ago, the momentum for a great, great success on March 9 was obvious.

Runaway inflation and ominous beginnings of a recession threatened our economic strength and our economic stability. International tensions threatened the peace throughout many areas of the world.

It's inevitable with our spirit and our determination and our background, and you are the ones that really make it, not those of us in Washington."", 'Let me cite some things that I think are worthwhile for us to recollect. Our national economy is growing stronger and more prosperous every single day. Unemployment is going down. It is not as low as it ought to be, and it will get lower, but we are headed in the right direction.', 'Consumer confidence is going up. We have had almost a 180 degree turn in the last several months, and that feeds on itself, and that is going to get better and better. And that is what we need to keep this momentum going.', 'The Department of Commerce announced just 2 days ago, that the index of leading economic indicators rose by 2.2 percent in January, the largest gain in 6 months. It is just getting better almost every day.', 'That index showed improvements in the length of the average work week, the job layoff rate, wholesale prices, vendor performance, stock market prices, contracts and orders, net business formations, new orders and building permits. This shows that almost every segment of our economy is rebounding in a strong, dynamic, and encouraging way. We are on the road to a new prosperity in America, and we are not going to be sidetracked now. We are certainly not going to be sidetracked by some of those phony fixes that some people want to prescribe for America.', 'The rate of inflation has been cut almost in half from what it was a year ago. Real earnings for the average American have increased significantly. We have recovered 96 percent of the jobs lost to the recession, nearly 2,100,000 job gains since last March, and 800,000 in the month of January.', 'We have cut in half the annual growth of the Federal budget this year, and if we can keep the pressure on and hold the spending down, we can balance the budget in 3 years, cut your taxes, and give you an awful lot more economic recovery of your own. That is our target.', 'The fact that we have turned the economy around is a credit to the American people who did not panic and to the American free enterprise system which responded to one of its toughest and greatest challenges. The forecasts of gloom and doom were wrong again, because the false prophets among us once again underestimated the courage and the determination and the ingenuity of the American people.', 'I have never underestimated the American people, all of you and 215 million others like you, and I never will. I thank you for all these great characteristics. We have recovered our economic strength without starting a new round of double-digit inflation and without resorting to unsound inflationary remedies for our present day problems.', 'Through commonsense steps, I initiated tax cuts for individuals, tax incentives for business expansion and job production, and extended economic cushions for the Americans out of work. We worked our way out of the worst recession in 30 years.', ""I have always believed the harder you work, the luckier you get. Hard work and hard decisions have made the difference in this recovery. We are lucky we didn't listen to those who would try to spend our way out of our recession instead of working our way out."", 'In fact, as Skip and Lou know, I vetoed 46 bills since becoming President. The interesting point--and I want you to listen very, very carefully--I did this without endangering or weakening our economic recovery. And incidentally, those vetoes have saved the American taxpayer $13 billion, and we will do it again and again and again.', ""One of those vetoed bills which some of you were particularly interested in was the so-called common situs picketing bill. We all know that a healthy striving construction industry is vitally important to any real long-term economic stability, whether here in Sarasota or in the Nation as a whole. The common situs bill, as presented to me, might well have threatened that stability. Even in Latin, common situs spells trouble, and trouble we don't need."", 'Something else that spells trouble, unless the Congress acts promptly, is the problem of deficit spending in the Social Security system. This year, the Social Security Agency [Administration] will pay out $3 billion more than it takes in. Next year, unless corrective action is taken, that deficit in a 12-month period will be $3.5 billion, and it will get worse year by year instead of better.', 'In my State of the Union Message in January and in St. Petersburg 2 weeks ago, I pledged--and I reiterate it here this afternoon--the integrity and the solvency of the social security system. In my budget for 1977, I am recommending a full cost-of-living increase in social security benefits. They must be paid this year and in the years hence.', ""As I look around this wonderful group and refresh my memory with the occasions I have had to shake hands with many of you, let me say something that comes from the depth of my heart, and I know you join with me in the same feeling: Aren't we all proud to be Americans? Aren't we proud of America? Aren't we sick and tired of these skeptics and cynics and critics who downgrade and undercut what has been so beautiful in America for 200 years? America needs our support, and we are proud of it, and we are proud to be Americans."", 'I think it is time we remembered that we are the most richly blessed nation in the history of the world. We have special gifts and special resources and very special responsibilities greater than any other nation in the world.', 'The social security system, obviously, is something that has to be good, strong. It must be kept secure for this generation and future generations. We must think of the kind of country that we will leave to those future generations in our time.', 'America, we all recognize, has had its share of problems, but we are going to solve them. We will solve the social security problem. We will solve the economic problem. I am an optimist about our great country, and we will be a great country in the future. In that future that we must chart, at least a part of it is predicated on what happens in the election of 1976. The American people will make crucial and far-reaching decisions this year. Each of you must decide what role you want your government to play in your own life and in the life of your Nation.', 'Let me sort of simplify something I believe in very deeply. We must never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.', 'But in the process of deciding what what we all do in 1976, you must decide what qualities and what characteristics of leadership you expect in your public officials. You must decide what course you want our national economy to follow in the years ahead--a firm, steady course of growth and stability or a course of drastic turns, costly experiments, and increasing government control.', 'It is the strength and the genius of the American political system that you can make those decisions, each and every one of you, for yourself, and how lucky we are. Election day is a celebration day for freedom. I hope that you will join in that celebration, and I hope that you will give me your support on March 9, November 2, and in the 48 months ahead.', 'Thank you very, very much.']"

That's a sizable list of things on the up. This shows that in almost every segment of our economy, there is a rebounding, strong, dynamic, encouraging way."", 'We are on the road to a new prosperity in America, and we are not going to be sidetracked now. We are going to move ahead strongly, affirmatively, and healthily.', ""Let me speak for just a minute about some things that concern all of us. Employment has gone up. In January alone, we gained 800,000 new jobs, the biggest monthly increase in nearly 16 years. And that's progress by any measurement. In January alone, unemployment fell by five-tenths of 1 percent, the biggest monthly drop in more than 16 years. We are still not moving as fast as I would like it, particularly in Florida. But we are moving and moving in the right direction; and I am not going to let up until every American who wants a job will have a job. That's a promise to you."", ""During 1974--just let your memory go back a bit--inflation was raging at an annual rate of more than 12 percent. The latest indicators show we have cut it almost in half. Again, I am not satisfied; that's still too high. But by any standard, that's real progress. And the American people know it, and I think they kind of like it, because we are going to do better and better as we move ahead."", 'The latest index of-consumer confidence--and that is all of you, how you and your family and your neighbors look at the future--it is double that of a year ago. The American people know that we have gone through a tough time. But they know we are on the way back up, and so consumer confidence is indicated in every place in almost every household.', ""Real earnings for the average American worker rose significantly in January, well above the rate of inflation. That means that your purchasing power is on the increase. Now, when you get a bigger paycheck--and I hope you get a lot of them--it doesn't buy a smaller bag of groceries, and that's the real test for the housewife."", ""Nearly 2,100,000 jobs have been recovered since last March. That's 96 percent, almost 100 percent of all the jobs lost during that worst recession in more than 30 years. And we did it--this is the encouraging thing--we did it without strapping fiscal responsibility, without massively tapping the Federal Treasury, and without sapping the American taxpayer. Again, that's the way to do it, and that's the way we have done it."", ""We didn't resort to expensive, temporary, quick-fix Government solutions. Through the commonsense ideas that I initiated and promulgated--listen to them--these were the good polices: tax cuts for individuals, tax incentives for business expansion and job production, and extended income cushions for those Americans out of work. With all of these programs and with your help, and the fact that you didn't panic, we have weathered the worst of the storm. As a result of this administration's action, we have begun a vigorous economic recovery. But the price of America's economic recovery was not a new round of double-digit inflation, nor was it billions and billions of extra dollars from the Federal taxpayer."", 'I think all of you here know where I stand on the critical issue of unnecessary Federal spending. I vetoed, and I underline ""veto,"" 46 bills since becoming President-and without endangering or weakening the economic recovery. Listen to this: These vetoes will save the American taxpayer $13 billion. That\'s a lot of headway. And let me assure you, let you in on a little secret, I will continue to veto those extravagant spending bills again and again and again, until we restore some self-control in the United States Congress.', 'We have to keep our financial house in order, and you have every right to expect that the Federal Government, your Government will do the same thing. If we can hold the line on Federal spending, if we can keep the budgetbusters in Congress under some control, then another major tax cut will be entirely possible in the latter part of this year and another one in 1979, and we will balance the budget at the same time.', ""As I've said, I think we've got a strong economy, and I intend to make it even stronger. I want more jobs for Americans, and I want those jobs to provide Americans with a future to give you pride, as well as a paycheck. I want to sustain our prosperity not only as a goal but as a fact of life in the United States of America."", 'But economic progress is not the only progress we have made. Today America is at peace. Today, there are no Americans fighting anywhere in the world. I want to keep it that way. We will keep it that way, and that is good for America as the rest of the world.', 'I believe in peace and freedom through strength. We will stand tall and strong and keep our powder dry so the United States of America can negotiate from a position that commands respect and invites cooperation from those that waist to deal with us. I have taken very firm steps to ensure that our major alliances are strong, our commitments are valid, and our defenses are without equal throughout the world.', ""I have proposed in the last 2 years--and I hope you will listen to this because it is true, and some people have made some sly, slight remarks about it--I have proposed the largest two peacetime defense budgets in America's history, reversing a trend that was reducing our defense expenditures year by year to levels that were dangerously low."", 'The price of our national defense may be very high, but the price of freedom is one that Americans have always been willing to pay in blood, in sacrifice, in treasure. We are no less willing to pay that price in America today to keep our Nation secure.', ""And if we continue the kind of defense budgets that I have recommended and if the Congress cooperates and doesn't slash them as they have in the past, America will have peace and freedom. We will deter war, and we will maintain our national security. Help me. The Congress needs to get the message."", ""But America's security rests on more than armaments alone. It rests, in part, on our determination to make the lives of our own citizens here secure at home. This is especially important for America's older citizens to whom this Nation is so deeply indebted."", 'In my State of the Union Address to the American people and to the Congress, I pledged to ensure the integrity and the solvency of the social security system. I am fighting to maintain that solvency. American working men and women who have labored too long and contributed too much to the greatness of America to be denied the income that they have earned for their retirement in later years.', 'I will continue to push, prod, and press the Congress to make sure that your social security benefits now, as well as in the future, will be responsibly funded and fully protected.', 'To be sure, strong, and secure from within is a great bulwark of our liberty, and that is something that we must never, never forget. But our ultimate strength is the one of the spirit, the love of freedom, the pursuit of justice, the commitment to progress which Americans have shared for 200 years. We live in a nation that is the envy of the whole wide world.', 'Frankly, let me just say this: I am darned fed up with those Americans who downgrade America, and I hope you are, too. Obviously, you and I agree. We believe in America. We believe in its strength. We believe in its purpose. We believe in its goodness and, believe me, I believe in you, the American people, and I thank you for your support.', ""Let me say something that means very much to me. We in America need frankness, candor, forthrightness. We shouldn't promise more from Washington than we can produce, and we shouldn't tell the American people that they can have everything. We should tall them the facts, and we should produce everything that we promise. And I say to all of you here, the wonderful people from Tampa, everything I promise you, we will produce, and we won't promise you anything we can't produce."", ""Let me add this: Working together--that is you and me--we can look to an even brighter future for our children and their children. These wonderful young children, boys and girls, give me an inspiration. We inherited--those of us alive today--a country that was given to us by our forefathers, and they gave us a great country. I think we, through wars and depression and recession and other problems--when the scorecard is kept, when the historians write the books, they will say we didn't do too badly, either."", ""But we have some things we've got to do, not for us, necessarily, but for these great kids, these great young people. That's our obligation, and I know that you will join me in making certain that that obligation, that responsibility, is maintained."", 'But let me conclude with just this observation and comment, I look out that way and you are looking here, but all of us can see an America today in which all men and women live in dignity and security and harmony and peace.', 'We can see a people taking pride in the work and finding pleasure and purpose in their lives. We can see America--and Tampa and Florida and 49 other States--in which government is the capable servant and not the master of its people.', 'We can see America, which cherishes those old values of honesty, compassion, determination, and courage. We can see America, in which those dreams we have dreamed since our youth--and these young people are dreaming today--we can see an America in which those dreams will come true.', 'That is my goal. That is what we want for all of America. And that is why I ask you, and I ask you very deeply, I ask you for your support in these coming days and these coming years.', 'Thank you very, very much.']"
34,Gerald R. Ford ,"March 06, 1976","[""Thank you very, very much. It's wonderful to be here, and I thank the Chairman; I thank the good mayor, Mr. McJilton. It's delightful to have with us here the outstanding Secretary of Agriculture, Senator Chuck Percy, Congressman Ed Madigan, Congressman Paul Findley, my very good friend and your former great Governor, Dick Ogilvie. I hope I haven't missed anybody."", 'The last 2 days in Illinois have been superb and, of course, this meeting here today is likewise a very wonderful experience for me. And I thank all of you for coming out on a Saturday afternoon, whether you come from your farms or your business or Chanute field.', ""And speaking of Chanute field, we've got an outstanding Secretary of Defense in Don Rumsfeld who comes from the great State of Illinois. And I think Don ought to come down here and take a look at it."", ""I might add, I had a wonderful experience out there listening to that delightful chorus. They sang just the kind of songs I like, and I suspect all of you do, too. But I also understand that the band from Rantoul High School postponed, at least, if not didn't go to the State Band Championship to play while I'm here. And if they delayed their departure, I'm thankful. And I am most appreciative, obviously, if they forewent the opportunity to go down to the championship. That kind of dedication I am most grateful for."", ""Now, let's talk about farm policy and let's say a word or two about defense. Let's take farm policy first. I, of course, have long believed in the kind of farm policy that Earl Butz has been promoting--full production, exports of the greatest amount that the United States has ever done. We were checking some figures last night. Between our commitments to sell to Japan, to Eastern Europe, to Western Europe, to the Soviet Union, we are expanding America's greatest resource in a very responsible way. And farmers will be prosperous and America will be prosperous because of the importance of agriculture to all of us."", 'But let me assure you that we are going to support the exports to the maximum, and I can assure you of one thing: Farm exports will never be used as a pawn in international politics.', ""But let's take a minute to talk about national security. The United States today is second to none in military capability, and that's because we have the best weapons, we have the best personnel, we have the best aircraft, we have the best trained people. The United States is strong. It can handle the problem of deterring aggression, it can handle the problem of protecting our national security, and through strength we can maintain the peace."", 'But I have to warn you that if the trend that has gone on for the last 10 years, where we are spending relatively less a percentage of our overall Federal expenditures for national security and a correspondingly greater percentage of our total expenditures by the Federal Government for domestic programs-we will be in jeopardy.', ""Ten years ago, out of the total Federal expenditures, we spent roughly 42 percent for national security, and we spent about 31 or 32 percent for various domestic programs. Last year, we spent about 24 percent for national security and about 51 percent for all our domestic programs. Now, we can't tolerate that situation."", ""Domestic programs have been going up at the 'rate of about 11 percent a year, and the military spending has been under pressure to hold the level or to go down. And the budget that I submitted a year ago, at that time was the largest peacetime budget in the history of the United States; Congress cut it $7 1/2 billion. They shouldn't have done it, but they did."", ""In January of this year, I submitted the biggest peacetime budget for the Defense Department in the history of the United States--$112.7 billion--the largest peacetime military budget in the history of the United States. But it's important, and Congress had better not cut it. They just can't, because while we, for the last 10 years were spending a corresponding lesser amount of our wherewithal in national security, the Soviet Union was adding to their expenditures."", 'Now, we are strong. We have the necessary capability to deter aggression, to protect our national interest, and to maintain the peace through strength. But I need your support to make sure that we get what we want, so the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marines can continue to do the outstanding job with the best equipment, the best personnel, the best training--just the best.', ""I need your help, and I say I think the Members of the House and Senate here will support me. But keep your eye on them. [Laughter] Don't let them cut it. If they want to add to it, that's all right with me, but we've got enough and we will be strong. We can 'reassure our allies, and we can negotiate from strength with any adversary."", ""It's great to be here. It is just a wonderful day here in Rantoul. It has been a great day and a half in all of Illinois. And I wish Betty were here, but she wore herself out last week down in Florida trying to help get my polls up to hers so I might win. [Laughter]"", ""I do thank you very much. It's great to be here with all of your fine Congressmen, and I thank you very much for the chance to come to Redwood Inn."", 'Thank you.']"
35,Gerald R. Ford ,"March 11, 1976","['Thank you very, very much, John Anderson, Senator Chuck Percy, Governor Ogilvie, Dave Martinson, ladies and gentlemen:', ""At the very outset let me thank, from the bottom of my heart, this fine group of young Girl Scouts who are the Bicentennial Choir. Let's all give them a great big hand. And we should do exactly the same thing for the Proud American Singing Group. Let's give them a hand."", ""May I ask everybody to be quiet for just a few minutes. What I will say won't take long but what I will say I hope you will listen to because it is what we have to believe, what we have to do if we are going to make America what it must be for older people, for younger people, for all of us. So please be quiet just a minute."", 'It is a great privilege and pleasure, it is an inspiration to be here in Rockford on this occasion. It is a great experience for me to come to this Cherryvale Mall where I see in brick and mortar what a vigorous America can do and will do.', 'I thank John Anderson, my very good friend, for the very kind and thoughtful comments he made in the introduction. Let me assure you that I will aspire to be all that John has said because that is what a President of the United States should be. And I promise John and I promise you that I will seek to accomplish and to achieve personally and in policy what John Anderson has outlined for you tonight.', 'As we were driving over here this evening, I thought of what the circumstances were 19 months ago, and let me quickly review where this country was at that time in August of 1974.', 'The American people in Rockford, in Grand Rapids, in all of our 50 States, for reasons that we all know, had lost confidence in our country, in our government. We all know that 19 months ago we were experiencing the most disastrous inflation, we were on the brink of a horrible recession with unemployment shortly to go up and employment about to go down. We also know that 19 months ago our country? torn apart. No public official could go onto a campus in this country. Few public officials could talk to any group without confusion and chaos and all of the things that were so foreign to the country that we had inherited from our forefathers. America was on the brink of the most frustrating and traumatic experience, certainly during my lifetime.', 'But in the last 19 months, tremendous progress has been made. Most of the credit for that progress should go to you, the American people, because you did not panic, you did not lose your cool, and you had faith in our government.', 'But let me outline some of the things that I think have happened, that have come about because there was some leadership. It is my judgment that the American people have had a restoration of faith in our country and in our government, and you should have it.', ""It is my feeling that because you got some straight talk from the White House, from the Oval Office, you believe what your President tells you. Let me be very straightforward. I don't intend to promise more than I can deliver, and I assure you we will deliver everything we promise."", 'I know that although we have made great progress in going from the depths of the recession in March and April of this year and that we are headed upward to a new prosperity in America, that in Rockford you have an unemployment that is much too high. I know that in many areas of this country unemployment is still too high, but let me give you some reassuring facts--facts that should prove to you beyond any doubt whatsoever that the right policies have been in place and the right course of direction is taken--whereas 19 months ago inflation was 12 to 14 percent, today it is half of that, and the rate of inflation is going down, and it will keep going down.', 'We also know that in the last 2 months there has been very encouraging news on the national front that employment is going up and unemployment is going down. Again, it is still too high, much higher than we want it and much higher than we are going to permit it to be, but from a high of 8.9 percent several months ago, it is now down to 7.6. The trend is right, and that trend is going to continue. Employment is going up and unemployment is going down, and we are going to keep both trends going in the right direction.', ""But there are some other things I want to talk to you about. As I travel around the country and meet wonderful people like you, whether it is in Peoria or Champaign or other States and other cities, I find that people generally, regardless of what occupation they may be in, are disillusioned with the fact that government is too big, that government does not treat them right, that service to them for the taxes they have paid isn't in the right proportion."", ""What we are trying to do is to give to you the kind of Government service at the Federal level that will restore and renew your faith in what the Government is doing. I think we ought to get rid of those programs that don't work. We ought to do better with the programs that are good but that are not working as well as they should, and we ought to strengthen the good programs that have been helpful."", 'Let me take an example. Here in Rockford, you have been the beneficiaries of one of the very best programs that I know that the Federal Government has ever undertaken--we call it revenue sharing. It is where Federal tax dollars are sent to Rockford and to Winnebago County so that the locally elected mayors-and some of them are here with their city councils or city commissions or board of supervisors--can make decisions with that money to provide services to you, to build public works, to do what they have been elected to do by all of you. And in the 4½ years that general revenue sharing has been in effect, the city of Rockford will have received about $8 million and Winnebago County about $16 million.', 'That money has been put to good use in your city and in your county. And we are fighting right now, with the help of John Anderson and Chuck Percy, to make sure that that program continues so that those tax dollars will be utilized at the local level by the decisions made by your elected officials. That is a lot better than having some bureaucrat do it in Washington, D.C.', 'I said a moment ago that we were headed in the right direction to improve the status of our economy, to keep the trend of higher employment and lower unemployment and a lower rate of inflation going all in the right direction.', 'Now, there are some in our Presidential campaign group that say that the answer is more Federal Government programs, that the Government ought to provide the jobs, that we ought to spend more money so that the Federal Government can take the credit for jobs throughout this country. I strongly disagree with that philosophy. The way to solve the problem is through the private sector of America. Five out of six jobs in this country today are in the private sector, and if people are going to have permanent, meaningful jobs in the future, we have to stimulate the private sector. How can we do it? We ought to pass another tax reduction. We ought to pass tax reduction legislation that will give to industry more incentive.', 'John Anderson and Chuck Percy have been in the forefront for what we call the investment tax credit, but I think we ought to expand that. I think we ought to extend it to give to business the incentive to build a plant and to buy equipment now so that they can give jobs now.', ""In the interim, while our unemployment is too high, I think we have to be compassionate, we have to be concerned about the people who want to work but can't find a job, and for that reason we have extended our unemployment insurance and broadened the coverage. They don't like it because they want to work and they want a job, but we have to think of their families and of themselves."", 'But we want them to have an opportunity to get that job back or to get a new job and the best way to do it is through a tax incentive to individuals to stimulate consumption or to business to stimulate more factories and more expansion.', 'Let me make one other point. As I sit in the Oval Office of the White House I get letters, I get communications, I get legislation sent to me from the Congress, and there is a trend. People say why don\'t you do this, why don\'t you expand that program, why don\'t you spend more Federal money? Let me give you two answers to that. If we followed that course of action, if we did what the expansionists wanted us to do as far as the Federal Government was concerned, I don\'t think they have understood one of the fundamentals that is so important, and let me phrase it this way. I warn them, I look them in the eye and I say, ""Do you realize that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have?""', 'You know, I have been criticized for saying that the Federal Government should not spend as much money as some of the big spenders would like us to do. Well, I am proud of the fact that in 19 months I vetoed 46 hills, most of them adding extra funding to the Federal budget. And I am also very glad to note that 39 of those vetoes have been sustained by one-third of the House and for the Senate. What does that mean? What has been accomplished by those vetoes that have been sustained? One thing we should not forget--those vetoes that have been sustained have saved $13 billion in Federal expenditures and that is a lot of money that we saved.', 'And to those that are telling me they are going to send some more legislation like that down to the White House, I have looked them in the eye and said, ""We\'ll veto them more and more and more because that kind of spending is not good for America today and it isn\'t good for the future of America.""', 'Now, let me conclude with just one or two additional comments. As John Anderson said, this is one of the most inspirational meetings that I have ever attended. They tell me there are 10,000 people here. I can see that every place in this area is filled, and for that I thank all of you for coming out in a March night when it could have been just as easy to stay home, but you are interested in your government, and for that I thank you very much.', 'This is our Bicentennial Year. We have had 200 years in America. Refresh your memory just a moment. About 200 years ago some 50 elected delegates put together this Constitution by which this country has been governed. They met from March until September. They deliberated, they compromised, they worked to put together the greatest document for the governing of people in the history of mankind.', 'There is a wonderful story that is told about Benjamin Franklin who left Constitution Hall in the city of Philadelphia, and as he walked down following the last meeting of that great Convention, he was accosted on the street and he was asked by a bystander, ""Mr. Franklin, what have you given us--a republic?"" And Mr. Franklin responded by saying, ""We have given you a republic if you can keep it.""', 'Our forefathers for 200 years have kept this Republic for us. This Republic has gone through difficulties unbeknownst to us. We have met challenges from abroad, and we had a war between us in America. We have had depressions, panics; we have had all kinds of difficulties at home. But through that span of time with the kind of government that we have, America has met the challenge, and America is great today.', 'I happen to have the belief that America will be kept great by the people here in Rockford, in Michigan, and Wisconsin and the other 47 States. All of us of an older generation know that we inherited from our forefathers a great country. They worked and they labored and they did much to make America the great country that it is. And as I look through this audience and see some of these wonderful young people and those Girl Scouts and others here of a younger generation, I think everybody who has a chance to participate in government-whether it is an elective office or a party worker or as a voter--feels a sense of obligation in the decade of the seventies to make sure that this country is good to these young people. These young people deserve what we inherited from our forefathers. It is our solemn obligation to keep us strong at home and to keep us strong so that we can deter aggression, so that we can keep the peace, so that we can meet a challenge against our national security.', 'Let me say this country is strong. We have a Department of Defense--the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, Marines--some 2,100,000 of them; some stationed here in the United States, many of them stationed around the world, who are alert, who are well-equipped, who are well-trained, who are welt-led. They are giving us the kind of security that protects America against aggression, preserves the peace, and protects our national security.', 'So, let me close by simply saying we are making headway at home in keeping America strong, and we have the military capability to make sure that our security and our lives are not in jeopardy.', ""This is a team effort--the workers, the managers, the people in public office, the professional people, the young people, and the old people. America's 215 million wonderful people under a wonderful form of government, with great hopes and aspirations, the protector of freedom, one country in the world that can give to others the inspiration to have what we have."", ""This is our mission, our responsibility. I know that America won't let us down, and I know America won't let others down. I am proud to be an American, and I am proud of America just as you are.Thank you very much."", '[At this point, the President proceeded to another level of the mall to address part of the overflow crowd which had gathered there.]', 'I first want to thank the Kabala Drum and Bugle Corps. Thank you very much, fellows. I am just overwhelmed. So many good looking young folks, boys and girls, so many nice parents, so many nice people, period. I thank you all for coming very, very much.', ""Now, I don't know whether you heard what I said down below. Did you? Well, I won't say it again if you did or didn't. I just want to express my real appreciation for the wonderful turnout here in Rockford. I want to thank the Cherryvale people for making it available. I want to thank everybody who has come."", 'I think we have done the right thing for the country. In the 19 months that I have been President, we have gone through a tough time, but we are coming out of it, and we are going to do better and better. In the meantime, we have been able, through strength, to keep the peace, and we are going to keep the peace through strength.', ""Then let me just conclude by saying I would appreciate your help next Tuesday. I wound appreciate your assistance on Election Day. I won't let you down. I will do what is right. I will give you straight talk. I won't promise more than we can produce, and we will produce everything we promise. That's a deal."", 'Thank you very much.']"
36,Gerald R. Ford ,"March 12, 1976","[""Thank you very, very much, John, and Senator Chuck Percy, Governor Ogilvie, Bishop O'Neil, Mayor Lundstrom, Dave Martinson, Peter Kostantacos, ladies and gentlemen:"", 'Almost 73 years ago Theodore Roosevelt came to this city to dedicate Memorial Hall. That was the same year that the Wright Brothers launched the age of flight at Kitty Hawk. Since then Memorial Hall has entered into the rolls of the National Registry of Historical Places and Americans have landed on the Moon. That was the year also when the Federal budget was just over $500 million per year.', 'Since that day in June of 1903 when President Roosevelt journeyed to this very vigorous, this very industrious community in northern Illinois, Americans have faced many challenges--two world wars, a great depression, the atomic age, and now the space age. Throughout those 73 years, we have tested our institutions and found them very strong. We have mastered science and technology and have made them serve humanity. We have challenged our national character and found it resourceful and vigorous. And throughout those years, I think, as a nation we have learned many, many lessons.', 'One of those lessons that we learned is that bigger budgets and bigger government are not the magic answers to every problem that faces us as a nation. We must never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.', ""Since Teddy Roosevelt's day, the Federal budget has increased 600-fold. Yet only a dozen years ago many Americans sincerely believed that more Government spending could heal all of our social ills."", 'We found that more government spending too often made these ills worse, and there is plenty of evidence to sustain that position. And the resulting inflation spread that illness to all Americans, especially to retired people and others living on fixed incomes. It spread to the supermarket, to the department store, and it struck where it hurt the most--in our family budgets, our savings, and our take-home pay.', ""None of you here could manage a business or a household very long by spending more than you earn. Government can't be managed that way either. You have a right to expect that the Federal Government will practice fiscal restraint and make its ends meet."", ""I don't need to tell you that just 1 year ago this country was in very serious difficulty as the end result of unwise Federal spending over a long, long period of time. We were confronted at that time with both inflation and recession. In the face of more popular solutions that sounded good on the surface, we held the line on bigger and bigger spending. In many cases, a majority in the Congress wanted to take the very popular course, or what seemed to be the popular course, with budget-busting proposals."", 'I strongly disagreed with that approach and since becoming President some 19 months ago, I vetoed 46 bills sent down to the Oval Office from Capitol Hill. Thirty-nine of those vetoes were sustained, and John and Chuck were very helpful in that regard. And it is interesting to note that those vetoes amounted to a savings to the Federal Treasury and to the taxpayers, eventually, of some $13 billion. And may I add parenthetically, if there is a continuation of that kind of irresponsible action by the Congress in sending one after another inflationary budget-busting proposals to the White House, they will be vetoed every single time.', ""I think we have set a very firm and a very steady course toward recovery, and we have stuck to it. We didn't try to tinker with any quick fixes or superficial answers to the great American economy. We recognized and we encouraged the natural strengths in our free enterprise system, and I think it is working."", 'It was Teddy Roosevelt who said--I don\'t know whether he said it here in Rockford or not, but he did say, and I quote: ""It ought to be evident to everyone that business has to prosper before anyone can get any benefit from it."" And I will add that the heavy hand of government interference must be lifted before business can prosper. John Anderson in the introduction mentioned our attempt to deregulate the American business--a program of deregulation that, in my opinion, will work. We have made some headway with the enactment of the Rail Revitalization Act. We are pushing for deregulation in virtually every other independent agency, and we have a task force, or several, I should say, that are going through every department of the Federal Government--not people from that agency or that department but a group from another agency or another department that is requiring that every department justify all regulations and all forms that they require that department\'s constituency to make out or to prepare. I think we can reduce very substantially the redtape and the regulations that have been on the books, so to speak, for a long, long time, and I guarantee you that we will make progress in this regard.', 'And when I say the elimination of forms and the simplification of what individuals have to do, it is not just that business will benefit. I saw the other day-it is hard to believe--the number of forms and the depth of information that is asked of people who are, unfortunately, on welfare. They are as confounded by and irritated with the government as businessmen are. This is a proliferation in government agencies, period. And it has to stop, and it will stop.', 'Now, with five out of every six jobs in our economy in the private sector, it just makes sense that real, secure permanent jobs can best be developed in the private business and industry sector of our country. I think the private sector must be encouraged by healthy economic policies to grow, to expand, and to provide more jobs. And as John said in the tax proposals that I have recommended, one, I urge that beginning on July 1 of this year we will have an additional $28 billion tax decrease across the board, 75 percent of it going to individuals and 25 percent of it going to business.', 'In addition, I think, as was indicated by John, the best way to get unemployment reduced in individual areas or metropolitan portions of our country is to have a tax incentive for more rapid amortization so that business will expand in those high unemployment areas more rapidly.', 'Those are the kinds of jobs that will produce permanent, encouraging employment, but as also was mentioned, I announced last week to sponsor or to favor the estate tax exemption from $60,000 to $150,000. It was indicated to an agricultural group that the facts are that that proposal will help small business just as much as it will help those who own family farms.', 'Yes, family farms will benefit. Small business will benefit. It will permit both categories to pass from one generation to another without forced liquidation or, as John more dramatically said--what was the term you used?--auction. I think in either case it is bad for the small business or for the small family farm. I think it would help to provide continuity, enterprise, and bring added stability to the business and farming communities throughout our country.', 'Let me say, at least I believe so, it takes some experience in government and an intimate understanding of the Congress and our government institutions to take the courses that we have taken and to pursue them successfully, to stick with them, to see some results. I think this experience is helpful, and I am confident it was beneficial in keeping us on the right course. That does not mean I have to agree or they have to agree with me, Chuck and John, every single time. But you do get some special benefit knowing people on both sides of the aisle, knowing how the Congress works, whether it agrees with you or disagrees with you. And, therefore, I hope and trust that you can say that continuity has some benefit in the tough circumstances we are in today.', ""Now, I don't mean to recite the statistics which I think nationally confirm the fact that this economy is moving in the right direction. If we go back to March of this year or go back 19 months ago, you know that inflation was rampant, you know that we have cut it in half, you know that we went through a very traumatic experience with the worst recession this country has faced for 30 or 40 years, you know that we are coming out of it, consumer confidence is up, unemployment is going down, employment is going up."", ""Wherever you look, the statistics are encouraging. That does not mean that we are completely out of the woods, I am the first to admit it, but we didn't panic, we didn't lose our courage, we held a firm and steady course, and we are headed in the right direction. I think by all honest measurements we are headed in the right direction. We are beginning to see some of the familiar landmarks of recovery leading us to a better prosperity."", 'Any expert who is objective will tell you that across the country business is improving, farm income is improving, employment statistics are all encouraging. The budget that I submitted in January of this year and those that I plan to submit in the next 4 years will bring us a balanced budget in 1979 and will permit us to have at the same time, providing of course the Congress cooperates, another major tax reduction lifting more of the burden from our Federal taxpayers across the board.', 'In short, by any analysis, the directions we are going will bring us home in the right direction, and I am convinced that the direction we are moving abroad is also right. We will continue to maintain our diplomatic leadership in seeking constructive and cooperative solutions beyond our national borders. We know from past experience that world peace can only be assured by a very strong defense. As a nation today, we are second to none in military capability. And I might add most emphatically, we intend to keep it that way.', 'If you look at the trends that have been going on for the last 10 to 15 years in military expenditures, the facts are in constant dollars we have been spending less and less. That is a fact. But if we are going to be able to meet the challenges in any one part of the world and to deter aggression and to maintain the peace and to protect our national security, that trend line must be reversed.', 'I submitted a budget in January of this year, the largest peacetime military budget in the history of the United States--$112.7 billion, 25.2 percent of our total national expenditures. It was the first time that that trend line has started up.', ""That decision was not predicated on anything that had to be done immediately for our national security because we do have the best trained, the best equipped, the best led, the most alert military force in the history of the United States. That is what we have today. But the decision to add more spending to reverse the trend was to protect whoever might be President 3, 4, 5, 6 years from now because you don't turn a switch and all of a sudden have more missiles and more submarines and more aircraft, et cetera. The decisions made today in a defense budget materialize basically 2 to 4 to 5 years from now."", ""I repeat, this country is second to none in the capability that is required to protect our country, but we have to look down the long road and we cannot tolerate that trendline that has been going on. Somebody in the audience might ask, well, why didn't you do something about it last year? The facts of life are that in January of 1975, I then submitted the highest military budget in peacetime. Tragically, the Congress cut it $7.5 billion. But we can and we will make it up, and I ask you to support the kind of military programs and policies that we are undertaking at the present time."", 'And if we all join together--Democrats, Republicans, across the board--the current capability that we have as a nation now is fully adequate to meet any challenges from any sources, under any circumstances, and that is what is needed, that is what is essential for our security. And I pledge to you, as I am sure Chuck and John will do the same, under no circumstances will we play second fiddle to any country in military preparedness.', 'Quite frankly, as I say goodby, it has been a great experience to be in Rockford. I have been here several times in the past. It was a great opportunity yesterday to talk firsthand with a very fine cross section of American agriculture. It was a thrilling experience last night to be at Cherryvale Mall. And it was kind of nice to see my wife again, as she came back from California. You know, she has been out in Arizona and California trying to get my votes up to her polls. [Laughter]', 'But as I leave you this morning, I want to thank you for the great hospitality. I am proud to be here with John and Chuck and Dick Ogilvie and Dave and all of the others. I am proud of the record that we have tried to undertake for our great country in the last 19 months, and I am even prouder of the American people because I think they have done a great job in not reacting with panic and cynicism and skepticism. And I am proud of our kind of government, it is something worth protecting. And with your help, we are on the right direction building together an even greater America. Thank you very much.']"
37,Gerald R. Ford ,"March 13, 1976","['Thank you very, very much, Governor Jim Holshouser.', 'Coming back to Winston-Salem and back to North Carolina is almost like coming back to home for me. Our oldest son graduated from Wake Forest 3 years ago. A long time ago, I went to the University of North Carolina Law School and stayed at Carr Dormitory. There must be a little rivalry there. And then in the early days of World War II, I was stationed at the pre-flight school down at Chapel Hill. And over a period of 20-some years, I have campaigned for candidates for Congress, candidates for the governorship, candidates for the Senators. And so I think I have been the length and the breadth of North Carolina and hopefully, I have a friend or two. And thank you all for coming here.', 'I do want to thank every one of you for coming here on a Saturday afternoon to express your support, your interest, and with this kind of enthusiasm, we are bound to win a week from Tuesday.', 'Now, let me give you a little straight talk, because I think you are interested in straight talk. First, I hope you will listen very carefully. Since I took office about 19 months ago, we have given you straight talk. We have not promised more than we can deliver, and we have delivered everything that we promised. And we will keep that commitment in the future. Secondly, I think all of you recognize that for the last 19 months this country has gone through a very difficult time domestically.', 'When I took office, inflation was up here about 12 percent or more per year. We have cut it in half or more, and we are going to continue to make progress in the battle against inflation. When I took office some 19 months ago, we were on the brink of the worst economic recession this country has had in 30 years. And very shortly after August of 1974, unemployment started to go up and employment started to go down.', ""Now, there were some people who said we should make a quick fix, we should put everybody on the government payroll, we ought to bust the budget. I said there is a better answer. Ford's got a better idea. And so we tried to hold the line on Government expenditures against the budget busters. As a result, I vetoed 46 bills in 19 months. That's a record. And we have 39 of them sustained by the Congress, and we saved the taxpayers $13 billion. That's progress."", ""Because we didn't panic, because we didn't lose our cool, because we had a firm hold on the tiller, we have come out of that recession. And we are on the way up with employment going up and unemployment going down--and it is going down more and more in the months ahead."", ""But now, let me talk to you for just a moment about the problems we are going to face in the future, and we faced some of them in the past. There are some--I don't challenge their motives, I just think they are dead wrong--who want to expand the Federal Government at the Federal level and who want to take more and more power away from the States and more and more authority away from local communities. I happen to have great faith in Governors like Jim Holshouser, and I believe that we should give more faith and responsibility to your good local officials. There is nothing that sanctifies the wisdom of people in the bureaucracy in Washington, D.C. You have got good people in North Carolina who can make good decisions if we give them the money to do it."", 'But there are some people who think all answers have to come from Washington, D.C. They want to expand the bureaucracy, they want to put more power in the hands of those people who run things in Washington.', 'Let me give you a word of warning, and I think this summarizes it as about as cogently as you can. And please listen. We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.', ""Now let me say a word about our circumstances as we look around the globe, as we look at our national defense capability. There are some who want to downgrade America, who allege that we are weak, they don't know what they are talking about. And let me say it very firmly--America is strong today, and it is going to stay strong for our national security."", ""There have been some charges made that we don't have enough of this and enough of that. Let me just be very specific. In strategic capability we have more warheads, we have better accuracy, we have more strategic aircraft--America is fully capable of meeting any challenge under .any circumstances. We can deter aggression, we can keep the peace, and we can handle our problems of national security because America is strong. And let me assure you that under this administration this year and for the next 4 years we are going to stay strong because we have peace. And we are going to keep it because we are strong."", 'Let me conclude by saying that this is one of the most exciting, one of the most inspirational audiences that I have seen any place in this campaign. The momentum is going. We won in New Hampshire, we won in Vermont, we won in Massachusetts, we won in Florida, we are going to win in Illinois, and we are going to win in North Carolina. And when we get to Kansas City, we are going to win there, and we are going to win November 2.', 'Thank you very, very much.']"

Gee, it is great to be here, and thank you for coming out.', ""You know the Ford family isn't a stranger to North Carolina. Let me give you a quick recitation. I went to law school at the University of North Carolina one summer, and for 9 months I was with the Navy preflight school down at Chapel Hill. Then my son, Mike, and his wonderful wife, Gail, graduated from Wake Forest."", ""But, in addition, during 27 years that I have been in public office in Washington, I visited, time after time after time, the great State of North Carolina, trying to help Republican congressional candidates or senatorial candidates or gubernatorial candidates, trying to help to get good government. And let me say one of the finest efforts that has ever been made--and I can't take credit for it, but I am sure proud of him--and that is Jim Holshouser, your great Governor."", ""Let me take just a minute and talk to you right from the shoulder, straight talk. This country needs some language that all of us can understand. What we need is somebody in public office who won't promise more than he can produce and produce everything that he promises."", ""Now, let me take a minute or two to review what we said we would do and what we have done. Let's take in the first instance the economy. Nineteen months ago when I became your President, we were going through inflation at 12 to 14 percent per year. We were on the brink of the worst recession in the last 40 years in this country. We were about to see unemployment soar and employment drop off precipitously. But instead of panicking, all of the American people knew that the right thing to do was to have a firm, steady, constructive course."", ""The American people didn't buy these quick fixes, these phony proposals that so many wanted to sell around the country, and the net result is that we are on our way in America to a new prosperity. Unemployment is going down, employment is going up, and the cost of living is getting under control."", 'Just yesterday we got some more good news out of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The increase in the cost of living in February was one-tenth of 1 percent, the smallest increase in 4 years.', ""I can remember back in the spring when everybody was blaming me and the administration because we were in a recession. Well, we knew we would come out of it because the American people had a lot of courage and wisdom, and we knew we would come out of it because we had the right actions to take, and now that we are doing well and everything is improving, they don't want to give us any credit. But I think the voters will because they have more sense than some of those politicians who have been doing all of this talking."", ""But, you know, gee, last March and April when the clouds were covering the sky and there wasn't much sunshine, about every other day up on Capitol Hill we would hear of some quick-fix formula. They wanted to solve our problems by adding to the Federal payroll not a few, but millions, and they wanted to spend money like it grew on trees."", ""Well, those aren't the right answers. I call them budget busters, and in the process of trying to send to us down at the Oval Office some of these wild spending programs, I vetoed 46 of them. The Congress sustained 39 and, because I vetoed them, because we had enough people in the Congress who were voting fight, we saved the taxpayer $13 billion, and that ain't hay."", ""But there are also some people in Washington, and I guess around the country, a few who think that the way to do things better is to have the Federal bureaucracy grow and grow and grow; put more people on the Federal payroll to harass you on a day-by-day and a day-by-day basis. I don't agree with that. I think that is the wrong solution. And there is a very serious danger involved in that and, listen, because it is a very fundamental point. These people who want a bigger and bigger Federal bureaucracy and more and more control in the hands of a few all-powerful people never tell you what the ultimate is, and here it is: We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have."", 'Let me talk for just a minute about something that is very fundamental, I think, to all Americans and something that I understand has a great significance in this wonderful part of North Carolina. There are some people in Washington, not myself, some of the so-called liberals, who want to make every person who is a lawful owner of a gun register the gun or register the gunowner. I am against it, period.', 'The way to handle that problem is to make sure that the penalty is strict and that the courts send the people who use a gun unlawfully in the commission of a crime--goes to jail and stays there.', ""Now, let's talk for just a minute about a couple of things that the Federal Government has to do, must do. Number one, we have some 32 or 33 million citizens in this great land who have reached the age of maturity. They are sometimes called senior citizens. They are wonderful, wonderful older people. Your mother and father, our parents, they brought us up. They have earned the right for an honest, good retirement."", 'Now, there are some people that want to destroy the social security system. I disagree. We want to make it stronger. We want to make certain, we want to make positive, that the Social Security Trust Fund is there for those who are on retirement and those who are about to retire. And this administration is going to demand it.', ""Now, there is one other area of responsibility that the Federal Government has under the Constitution; that is, the national security, the defense of this great country. Let me tell you--and I say it very firmly and very strongly-the United States of America today is second to none in military capability, and we are going to stay there. Oh, I know there are some critics who charged otherwise, but I don't really have much faith in those who downgrade America. I think we ought to speak up for America."", 'Let me say that the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines are well-equipped, well-trained, alert. They are on the perimeters, and they are doing a great job for us. We should support them, and we do. They are strong enough to deter aggression, they are strong enough to maintain the peace, and they are strong enough to protect our national security. They are great, and we should give them 100 percent support, as we do.', 'Now, let me talk for a minute, if I might--I understand there is a rodeo in town. Well, sometimes this job, you know, in the Oval Office reminds me a little bit of riding a bucking bronco. But let me tell you one thing--I am not going to get thrown. With your help and support, I will stay in the saddle for 4 more years. While I am there, I will be riding herd on that Congress to get them to do some things right for a change.', ""But, then, let me take just a minute to talk about this great election that is coming up in the State of North Carolina on Tuesday. Back around January everybody said Jerry Ford was through, he couldn't win the nomination, we were going to lose here, here, and here. What happened? We came from behind in New Hampshire, and we won. We won in Massachusetts overwhelmingly. We did very well in Vermont. We surprised them and beat them quite badly in Florida, and we walloped them in Illinois."", 'We have the momentum going, and we need your help on Tuesday to keep that momentum going so we can go to Kansas City and get the nomination, which will be the clincher for a victory on November 2.', 'Thank you very, very much.']"

For the hour and a half, or whatever the time was, that Jim and I were in the car, I learned more about this mountain area than I could have learned anywhere else, because Jim is proud of the fact that he comes from here, and he praises you, he commends you.

It just makes me feel awfully good. I know that you sacrificed a lot, but I just have the feeling that you are not going to let me down on Tuesday, just like you are here today.', 'Now, let me take just a minute or two to talk about some of the things that I think are significant.', 'First, I am not a stranger to North Carolina. Quite a few years ago I went to your great law school at the university. I spent 9 months at the Navy preflight school at Chapel Hill, and then my son, Mike, and his wife attended and graduated from Wake Forest University. So, the Fords have a lot of connections with the State of North Carolina.', 'As Jim said, I have traveled a good bit in your great State, trying to help Governors get elected, Senators get elected, Members of the Congress get elected, and also to help in any way I could for the great cause of the Republican Party, which is a good cause and a cause that we should be proud of. It represents the philosophy, it represents the cause that is important as I look down the road for the future of America.', 'As Jim said, we have gone through some tough times in the last 19 months. When I became President, the cost of living was rising at the rate of 12 to 14 percent. We have cut it in half. As you might have read in the paper, or heard on radio or television, just yesterday we got some great economic news--the cost of living increased at the lowest rate in 4 years. We are on the right track, and we are going to keep going that way.', ""When I became President, we were right on the brink of the worst recession in 40 years. Economic clouds were dark. Everybody was pessimistic. The doomsayers were predicting all kinds of catastrophe for this country. But we kept a firm, steady hand on the tiller. We didn't panic. We had a good course of action. We had the right kind of plans to keep America strong in the future. And although unemployment went high and employment went down, we ended up with the right trend right now. Employment is going up and unemployment is going to go down, and it is going to get better and better in the months ahead."", ""Now, let me talk about two of the things that I think are vitally important. There are some people up in Washington who have been trying to sell the idea that the bigger the government got, the better it was for everybody. I don't agree with that. There is no person in Washington who knows all the answers."", 'Some of the people that have been trying to sell these quick fixes, these patent medicine solutions, are wrong. Let me tell you what we are trying to do under this administration. I have a lot of faith in your locally elected officials, your mayors, your councilmen, your sheriffs, your Governors, your State legislators. They are good people. They can make better judgments, they can make better decisions than some of those bureaucrats that sit behind those fancy desks in Washington, D.C.', 'So, we are going to send some of the money back to you so you can make the decisions at the local level. We are trying to cut down on the bureaucracy in Washington, get rid of the redtape. I think we can run the Government an awful lot better. Oh, there are some who want to bust the Federal budget and pile one bureaucracy on top of another. That is the wrong approach.', 'You know the Congress challenged me a good bit in the last 19 months. They sent down to the Oval Office in the White House a lot of bad legislation. I vetoed 46 bills, almost an all-time record. I was sustained 39 times by at least one-third of the Members of the House and Senate, and do you know how much money we saved by those vetoes?--$13 billion.', 'If a spendthrift Congress, a budget-busting Congress sends any more big spending bills down to the Oval Office, they are going to be vetoed again and again and again.', ""Now, let's talk about the affirmative, what we ought to do in government, what the responsibility is of the Federal Government. First, we have an obligation to our older people who are on social security. We have a social security program at the present time that people have paid into, they have earned their retirement, and we are going to keep that Social Security Trust Fund sound."", ""There are some that have gotten fancy schemes one way or another. I won't get into the details, but I will promise you as your President for the next 5 years that you will have a sound and secure social security program to take care of those who are now on retirement and those who are working and earning their retirement."", ""But let me say at the same time, the social security program is run well. There are some programs in the Federal Government that aren't any good, and we are going to get rid of them. There are those in Washington who want to pile this bureaucracy on top of another bureaucracy. That is the wrong way to give freedom in America. I am scared that if we go down the wrong path, we are going to lose our freedom in America. And that is as valuable and that is as priceless to us as anything."", ""Now, let me just say if you put the wrong people in Washington, you have to be fearful that they are going to husband all this power, take it away from you. There is one real fundamental danger that we have to watch, and it is put in about one sentence--just don't forget this--a government big enough to give you everything you want is a government big enough to take from you everything you have."", 'And now we are at peace. We have the military strength and capability to keep that peace. We have the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marines that are. strong enough to prevent aggression. We have the Department of Defense that is powerful enough to protect our national security and, if I am elected President--as I think we will be--on November 2, I will guarantee to you that the United States of America will stay strong, will be strong, and will keep the peace in the future.', 'You know, back in January of this year there were a lot of doomsayers saying or writing or talking that President Ford couldn\'t make it. And they looked at the polls, and they said, ""He never won an election outside the State of Michigan."" We went up to New Hampshire; we were behind. We had good people as volunteers; we worked hard; we had good programs. And, by gosh, we won.', 'Then we went to Vermont and Massachusetts, and we won real well there. Then we went down to the State of Florida, and some politicians clown there were saying that President Ford is going to lose 2 to 1. All these doomsayers and pessimists were predicting the worst results. We had a lot of fine people-just like you are--down there in that State of Florida. They went to work. We went down and campaigned. It rained a little bit down there, too, but people came out. We had a lot of enthusiasm, and we won real good.', 'Then we went up to that area that I come from, the Middle West, and in Illinois we had again some tremendous inspirational leadership. We had lots of enthusiastic people, and we just walloped the devil out of them out there in Illinois. [Laughter]', 'Now we are right here in North Carolina. What are you going to d o in North Carolina? As I look over this great, great crowd here tonight that came out and stayed out and are here now, I can look in the eyes of those old people and young people and everybody else.

You did the phoning and did all of the other difficult chores. We won, coming from behind. It was a total effort, the basis coming from people like yourselves who were volunteers. We had a great many other people, Members of the Congress, that went up there on their own. We had others who volunteered from various walks of life to go up and give us a hand.', 'Then, of course, was Massachusetts, where we did extremely well; Vermont, where we were entered and the opposition was not. It all helped to accumulate the position where we are in.', 'Then we went to Florida and again, according to the campaign manager for our opponent, we were behind 2 to 1--33 percent to 66 percent. But because so many people in Florida--and I literally mean this--gave their time and made the effort as volunteers, they turned it all around. We again had a broad spectrum of help and assistance. I went down twice. The momentum got going, and we had a very significant win.', 'Then we went to Illinois last week, and the momentum that had begun in New Hampshire, that had carried through, really gave us--well 59 to 40 percent. That is not bad.', ""Now, we've got a real test here in North Carolina. Again, the initial forecast was that we were going to lose. I don't think we are going to lose. I think we are going to win. You know, five is great, but six would look even better. [Laughter]"", ""But the momentum is definitely in our direction. I can foresee nothing but a real victory in Kansas City as a steppingstone, as a clincher for the victory in November. In the meantime, we have to maximize our individual efforts.

We are the minority party, and we have to solidify ourselves. I think we can, and I think we will. And the net result will be a real triumph on November 2.

We have been trying to get a better balance between the role of the Federal Government and the responsibility in the role of the State governments and local units of government.', 'As Governor Knowles1 knows, there was a period of time, over a period of some 20 years, when the Federal Government grabbed everything, and the net result was there was a corresponding loss in responsibility and decisionmaking at the State and local level.

I think there has been an overemphasis in the last 10 or 15 years on not being too harsh on the criminal. I believe that we have got to put the emphasis on the rights of the victim. We have got to look after the victims of crime and prevent crime from being undertaken.', 'And so this balance has to be restored. I think we have to restore better balance between domestic programs on the one hand and what we invest in our national security on the other.', ""So, we have tried to do this. We have made a lot of headway. We have taken ourselves to a great extent out of the worst recession in 40 years. If we just keep cool, don't succumb to all these quick-fix, panic propositions, we are going to end up with the healthiest, strongest, most equitable economy in the history of the United States."", 'Then, we have to make absolutely certain and positive that we are unsurpassed militarily, that we maintain our superiority in the productivity of our industry, the productivity of our agriculture, the superiority of our science and technology. When we put it all together, the United States is number one, far ahead of everybody else. And our responsibility, mine and 215 million other Americans, is to maintain that strength so that we can make it easier and better for all of us at home and to protect our national security from outside forces.', ""We have the strength agriculturally, industrially, commercially, scientifically. But the one thing that is even more important than anything else--I happen to believe as I travel around the world, on occasion traveling one country to another, that the great strength of America is its moral and spiritual leadership. We can't lose it because that is what ties everything together."", ""Thank you for your help. We are going to work with you, and I can't thank you enough.""]"

One, I have a great interest in, and have always had a wonderful affection for, the Green Bay Packers, but I also have always had a great time up here. I visited Green Bay on a number of occasions with one of my closest and dearest friends, Johnny Byrnes, who was your Congressman for so many years.', ""You know, I knew Gary Dilweg's1 father back in Washington, D.C., so I am very familiar with the Dilweg name. And it is just wonderful that they have worked as the chairmen here and working with all of you to help my candidacy next Tuesday and again in November of 1976."", 'Let me make one or two comments. From the very day that I was sworn in, I decided that I was not going to promise to do more than I could produce, and I was going to produce everything that I promised, and that is the policy, basically, that we have in this administration. We are going to be straightshooters, we are going to be candid, we are going to be honest, and I think that is the only way for us to be successful. And it is certainly the only way to create the kind of trust that I think is needed and necessary between a President and the American people.', ""We had our share of troubles beginning in August of 1974 up until a few months ago. We had very difficult economic conditions. We had to face up to them. We had rising unemployment, we had decreasing employment, we had inflationary problems, but we kept our cool, we didn't panic. We decided that a steady, firm, constructive course of action was right, and, by gosh, it has turned out to be right because things are getting better."", 'As I think we all recognize, there had been a great distrust developing between the people and government. And it has been a slow process of trying to rebuild that necessary trust, so that government and people work together. But I see strong signs all over the country that people and government are working together because they trust one another a lot more. We are going to keep that up.', 'Then, we have had some challenges from abroad. Some of our allies in the last year and a half have wondered whether the United States would stand by its commitments, whether the United States really wanted to continue to be a leader in the world. And some of our adversaries, I think, might have been tempted to try and challenge our capability. But, you know, the main thing is our allies today know that we can be trusted, they know that we have the strength to work with them to achieve what we all want, and our adversaries have not challenged us because they know we are strong in capability and strong in will.', ""Let me just make one final comment. Some people have alleged, some people have challenged whether the United States is number one. Let me put it this way: The United States is unsurpassed in military capability; the United States has the greatest industrial capability in the history of the world; our agriculture out-produces any other nation in the history of mankind; we are ahead in science and technology. But the most important thing is that the American people--plus all of these other things--we have a deep conviction morally, spiritually, and religiously. And when you put all of this in one package, America is number one, and those that challenge us don't know what the facts are."", ""I want to thank every one of you. We have got a big ballgame Tuesday, and you up here in Green Bay know what you mean by a big ballgame. It is a game that we have got to win, but it is a game we are going to win, and it will be the kickoff for a great victory November 2 of this year. And, boy, at the end of that we can all say we're proud to be Americans, and we're proud of America."", 'Thank you very much.']"

But I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to meet so many people in this 2-day period and to stop here and see all of you.', 'We will do our best as President.

It just is great, and I thank you all from the very bottom of my heart. It is wonderful. Thank you very, very much."", ""As I indicated, I have been to Amarillo on several occasions, and every time I come back, I see a greater spirit, a more wonderful drive, and I love those kind of people. I like to see progress, and you in Amarillo have the right spirit; you have the right objectives; you are agriculturally oriented; you do the best. You have got some oil and gas, you are doing well. You have got some retail, wholesale centers, and you are doing darn well there. Amarillo doesn't do badly in anything, and I am proud of you, and so should you be."", ""You know what it all comes back to, it's the right kind of spirit. If you think you can do something, and if you work at it, you can accomplish it."", 'And now let me relate that to what we have tried to do in the last 20 months since I have been President. Let your mind go back to August of 1974. We were in trouble. We had inflation at 12 percent or more, we were about to fall into the worst economic conditions, the worst recession we have had in 40 years. We had our allies abroad concerned about whether the United States would stand tall and strong. We had some adversaries who might have been tempted to take advantage of a new President.', ""First, we decided that we weren't going to panic, we weren't going to let the Congress smother us with some quick-fix legislation in order to get a superficial answer to our economic problems."", 'We decided that the best way to get jobs for Americans, to lick the inflationary problems, was not to add thousands and thousands and thousands of people to the Federal payroll, but rather to try and find a way to provide an incentive for the private sector, where five out of six jobs are available anyhow.', 'So what has happened in 20 months, I think we can be darned proud of the progress we have made. Inflation has been cut from over 12 percent to about 6 percent, and it is going down. A year ago unemployment was a terrible problem-8.9 percent unemployment. In the last 12 months, we have taken employment up 2,600,000 more jobs. Last month, we added 375,000 more jobs in the American economy. Unemployment is going down, and employment is going up because we decided to stick with the free enterprise system instead of having the government try to satisfy the problems.', ""But you know we also had a little pressure from Congress. Congress wants to spend money like you just haul it out of those wells. I don't know what your well situation is here, but in Michigan, I tell you, we have lots of them, and the Congress wanted to spend money like it was water. And believe me, that is not the way to balance the Federal budget. It is not the way to reduce your taxes. So, what we decided to do was veto all the big, budget-busting bills that Congress sent down. We vetoed 47 of them and 39 of them have been sustained. The best news is that we saved you $13 billion by those vetoes that Congress sustained, and $13 billion in savings is worth the effort. And I thank you for supporting us in that attempt we have done. I might say to the Congress if they send down some more bills that bust the budget like that, we will veto them again and again and again, period."", ""Now, let's talk about where our country--and I speak of it as our country because 215 million Americans have a great stake not only in the peace we have but in the peace that we want to keep, not only in the liberty we have and the freedom we cherish at this time but the freedom and liberty that we want for these young people that I see in the audience here tonight."", 'The United States today, and I say this with firmness and very direct-talking to you in the way that I think you understand--the united States of America is unsurpassed in military capability, and we are going to keep it that way.', 'If we take a broad look at this country with an unsurpassed military capability, with the tremendous industrial base and capacity that we have, with the agricultural production that is by any standards the greatest in the history of the world, when we look at our scientific and technological progress, our superiority in these areas, and when you add that important ingredient of moral and spiritual and religious dedication, the United States of America is number one.

You don't want a handout from the Federal Government, you want your Government to create the environment and the atmosphere that makes us great in the future like it has been in the past."", 'One of the basic truths that I think we all have to understand--and this audience I know feels as I do--that basic truth is: A government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.', 'So, we want our Government to create the atmosphere that gives all of you in Amarillo, and all of your fellow Americans all over the country, the opportunity and yet the responsibility to make America a better and better country.', 'But, in the meantime, we should stand tall and strong and say we are proud to be Americans and we are proud of America.', 'Thank you very much.']"

As we get more or less to the halfway mark, we are well above the 50 percent of the delegates that we need to win in Kansas City in August of this year. And when we keep going down the road with the momentum that we have gotten from the various primaries and from the various convention States, that momentum is real, and we are going to Kansas City and win, and win in November thereafter.', 'And let me tell you why I think we will win. We have got great organizations and outstanding leadership in every State of the Union, and you here in Indiana are typical. You have got the top people at the head, and we have got tremendous volunteer support.', 'I think also we have the right programs. And what are those programs? Those programs are aimed at having a strong economy that is going to provide jobs in the private sector, and those jobs have come because we have got the right programs.', ""As you will recall, when I became President we were on the brink of a very serious recession--the worst in 40 years in this country. We didn't panic. We took the right course of action. We decided that the best place to get jobs for people was not in government, loading up the Federal payroll, but getting jobs in the private sector, and it has paid off because right now we are moving up. Everything is going up that ought to be going up and everything is going down that ought to be going down, so keep the faith. We are going to win on this. It is the best program of any for any candidate to have this kind of a move, this kind of a trend that we have right today."", ""But let's talk about our other big assets. I think the old traditional programs are still sound. If you have got prosperity at home and peace around the world, those are the programs that are successful. And right now, for the first time in a good many years, there isn't a single U.S. military officer-man in combat around the world. We have got peace, and we are going to keep it that way."", 'Now let me just make one or two other comments. A lot of politicians-and I exclude Bill and I exclude the great Governor and your fine, outstanding Lieutenant Governor and any other Republicans who are here--[laughter]you promise only what you can produce, and you produce everything that you promise.', 'This administration is going to be frank and candid and honest with the American people. We have been, and as a result of that we have their faith and their trust.', 'So, I say to you, we have got the right organization with the right leadership. We have got not only quality but quantity in the volunteers. We have got the right programs both at home and abroad. We have got the enthusiasm, we have got the momentum and, believe me, we are going to win in Indiana on May 4.

I thank you very, very much.', 'It is obviously a great pleasure to be in Conroe, Texas, the third fastest-growing county in the United States--Montgomery County, I gather I have a friend or two here in Conroe and Montgomery County. Thank you very, very much.', 'The purpose of my visit can be summed up in a very few words. As much as I believe in a strong and prosperous American automobile industry, I am here to say that this year there is absolutely no reason to trade in your Ford for a new model. [Laughter]', ""The year 1976 is a very important, very critical year for this great country. It marks the turning point for our country as we enter the last quarter of the 20th century and begin the third century of America's independence."", 'It is good for us sometimes to take stock where we have been, where we are now, and where we are going as a people and as a nation. America has come a long, long way in the last 200 years. We have grown from a very small, poor, weak, and struggling collection of colonies to the greatest nation in the history of the world--the United States of America--and we are very proud of it.', 'We have come through wars, depressions, droughts, riots, assassinations, scandals, practically everything that fate can throw at America, but we have also enjoyed phenomenal economical, technological, and social progress in America. And that progress has made our way of life the envy of all peoples all over the world.', ""Despite all the problems we have had, I don't think any one of us would trade places with the people of any other country in the world today."", ""We hear some talk these days about America being in a state of decline. We hear that America's best days are behind us. We hear that America is only a second-rate power in the world today. Frankly, I am tired of hearing those who would run down America."", ""I am proud of America, and I am proud to be an American. I know that each and every one of you feel exactly the same way. I believe in this country. I believe in its values, its traditions, its institutions, its people. I believe deeply in America's future."", 'We have the capacity in this country to do just about anything we set our minds to. America today remains the best hope of peace, the strongest guardian of freedom in the world, in the globe, and we are pursuing a policy of peace through strength, and we are going to keep it that way.', ""I can assure you that America's defense capabilities are fully sufficient to keep the peace, to deter aggression, to protect our national security and our freedom. And let me assure you once again, without any hesitation, qualification, or equivocation, we intend to keep it that way."", ""But America's strength is measured by more than armaments alone. America today is the greatest agricultural power, the most prolific producer of food and fiber in the history of mankind. I want to see the family farm survive in this great country. I want to make it easier for people to pass on their farms, the product of many years of hard work, love, and faith, to their sons as well as to their daughters. I want to make it easier to keep those farms in the family, rather than sacrificing them to the tax collector."", 'I have proposed two measures to help promote that result: First, a proposal that Congress act to stretch out estate tax payments at greatly reduced interest rates over a 25-year period and, second, I have proposed an increase in the estate tax exemption from $60,000 to $150,000. We need that kind of action.', 'These proposals, if enacted, would help not only family farms but family businesses as well. Family-owned businesses, like every other segment of our economy, suffered very heavily in the worst recession in 40 years. But thanks to some strong, commonsense policies at the outset of the recession and thanks to the determination and the courage of the American people, we are working our way out of this economic difficulty.', 'With one favorable economic indicator after another pointing the way, we are on the road to recovery and to prosperity in America, and we are picking up more and more speed every day.', 'One of the main reasons this recession hurt us as much as it did was our dependence on foreign energy sources. Price increases, as we all know, in 1973 quadrupled the cost of foreign oil. Our dependence on foreign oil was too great then, as I recall 30 or 31 percent, and that dependence cost us a great deal more than the long lines at the neighborhood gasoline stations.', 'It cost us hundreds and hundreds of thousands of jobs, billions of dollars in production, increased inflation, and many, many months of major economic problems. But the really shocking thing about all of this is that our dependence on foreign oil has actually increased since 1973, because the Congress, or a majority of the Congress, simply refuses to recognize either the urgency or the severity of this problem.', 'This is an oil country, I understand, around Conroe and Montgomery County, and you very fundamentally understand the problem. We in America need energy independence. We must have it, and we are going to get it.', ""The sooner we get the government regulations off the back of America's oil and natural gas producer, the sooner we will achieve energy independence for America, for 215 million Americans. And obviously, I say, the sooner the better."", 'Fifteen months ago, as Senator Tower and Congressman Wilson know, I recommended decontrol of oil and new natural gas prices. The Congress deliberated, delayed, debated, and dawdled all the way from January to December of 1975 and finally sent me an energy bill. Believe me, it was a long way from perfect, as John and Charlie know, but at least it was a start.', 'In that bill, the Congress agreed for the first time to remove control over oil prices. Unfortunately, the Congress insisted that full decontrol be carried out over a 40-month period. I indicated last December that I would order immediate steps to remove controls of petroleum products. I also pledged that I would use all of the flexibility available in that legislation to allow the increases in crude oil prices that are absolutely necessary to stimulate domestic oil production.', 'We have already sent to the Congress the plan for the decontrol of residual oil, and this decontrol plan will go into effect in a very few weeks. Plans are also being prepared to decontrol distillates and gasoline. We are moving in the right direction in this whole area, both to provide the incentives that we need and to reduce the control of the Federal bureaucracy over this great industry.', 'But my goal has been, will continue to be, the removal of all price controls from oil and new natural gas as the very, very best way to achieve energy independence for the United States of America.', 'Last week, obviously, I was very pleased that the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association expressed its support for my efforts to achieve energy independence for America. I deeply appreciate that support from one of the largest and most influential petroleum associations in Texas.', 'Let me assure you, as well as them, that I intend to keep right on with these efforts for the next 4 years.', 'Furthermore, I will do all that I possibly can to see that government regulations and redtape do not enslave free enterprise and personal freedom in this great country. The heavy, heavy hand of government has found its way into too many areas of our national and personal life.', 'If there is one thing that we must never forget, it is that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have. We have the very best system of government in the whole globe. It is a system laid out with great care and paid for at great, great price by patriots yearning for freedom. It is a system that can be a powerful instrument of progress and enduring peace, a source of strength and security. But it must always be a servant, never the master of the American people.', ""We want the freedom in this country to choose our own course and our own life, to chart our own future on our own terms without the government telling us everything we can and cannot do. The elections of 1976 will play an important role in deciding what course we chart for America's future. The future that I see is one in which we find all Americans living in dignity, security, in harmony, and in peace."", 'I see people taking pride in their work and finding pleasure and purpose and prosperity in their lives. I see an America which cherishes the old values of honesty, compassion, and determination and courage. I see an America which continues to stand tall and strong and free among the nations of the world.', 'I see an America which rises to its challenges, fulfills its responsibilities, and takes advantage of the opportunities for progress in every field of endeavor. These are my goals, and this is the reason why I ask for your help and assistance, your support on May 1, November 2, and in the challenging years ahead.', 'Thank you very, very kindly.']"

[Laughter] But let me just give you a quick evaluation of the wonderful day and a half or almost 2 days that we have had in Texas. Of course, we started just across the border in Shreveport near east Texas and moved from there to Longview and on further west."", ""But everyplace we have been we have had a warm, receptive, and, I think, enthusiastic reception. Let's be honest and frank. All the polls and everything else indicated we started as an underdog. But we are closing that gap, we are going to give them a real tough go, and I think we can win."", 'And let me tell you why I think we have made such substantial progress. Number one, in Senator John Tower we have got an outstanding leader, and you should all be very proud of him as your senior United States Senator.', 'Secondly, the kind of people that all of you are and the time and effort and the determination that you have had and, I said, whether it is in Longview or Tyler or anyplace else, we not only have an awful lot of quantity like all of you here but we have the best in quality in our volunteers. And thank you very, very much.', 'Then I happen to think we have some pretty good policies, both at home and abroad. So, when you call and talk from a phone bank or when you speak to your neighbor or you talk to somebody at the supermarket or one of you in your professions, whether it is the law or otherwise, you ought to have some affirmative selling points. And let me give you those very quickly.', 'We are on the upswing, and we are moving more rapidly every day to a prosperous and stable and healthy economy in the United States, and we can take credit for it.', ""When we talk about jobs, we now have 86,700,000 people gainfully employed in the United States. That is the highest figure in the history of the United States. That's not bad. In the last year, we have gained 2,600,000 jobs. A year ago, in May or April, we had a very bad economic situation. Jobs were being lost, the unemployment was much too high, but in this last 12-month period we have gained this 2,600,000 jobs, we have reduced the rate of unemployment, and the headway on jobs is up and the trend on unemployment is down."", 'But the most important factor, when we look at the overall picture, is what has happened in the area of inflation. When I became President 20, 21 months ago, the rate of inflation was 12 to 14 percent, unbelievably high, caused by a number of factors, but we undertook some sound, I think constructive, steady courses of action.', ""We didn't let the Congress roll us over--[laughter]--and the net result is the rate of inflation for the first 3 months of 1976 is under 3 percent. That's a 75-percent reduction."", 'And then there is another factor that I think we can sell. A President has to be firm and decisive. In dealing with the Congress, we have got a good batting average. We vetoed 48 bills; 39 of them have been sustained, and in the process, we have saved the American taxpayer $13 billion.', ""And the person that occupies the White House--you know he can't have any retakes. [Laughter] He has to make a decision and stand with those decisions. About a year ago some international bandits tried to capture--and did capture-an American merchant ship. And what did we do? We took firm action and got it back, and that is the kind of leadership that this country has to have."", 'And I might say that if any future international bandits want to use those kind of tactics, they have been well warned that this administration is not going to tolerate any adventurism throughout the world.', 'But let me say in conclusion, we have got strength, we have got the calm, determined attitude that is necessary and required in this country, whether it is in the handling of domestic policy or in the area of foreign affairs. We have strengthened our alliances around the world. And we have convinced our adversaries that it is more important to negotiate than to confront.', ""And so, we have some selling points. But all of it really comes down to this bottom line. All of you are an important, in fact, I would say the main ingredient in how well we do on Saturday. The phone calls you make, the efforts that you undertake--that will make the difference. We are going to be working 16, 18 hours a day between now and Friday night. We will do the best we can. We won't let you down. And I know you will make a maximum effort, and those clouds on Sunday could look awful bright, and I think they might."", 'Thank you very much.']"

And all I can say to Tom is, with his help and the help of many, many more concerned Texans like him, we are going to win on Saturday, May 1. But we are not only going to win on Saturday, May 1, here in Texas; we are going to win in Kansas City; we are going to win November 2 and go right on winning for America for the next century.', 'When I became President about 21 months ago, our great country, the United States of America, was faced with some very serious concerns. Runaway inflation and recession both threatened our economic strength and the stability of America; international tensions threatened the peace in many, many areas of the world; a crisis of confidence in our own Government and in the basic institutions of our society threatened the promise of a 200-year American experience. It was a bleak, depressing picture. It was a time that called for strong, affirmative action.', 'Twenty-one months later, the results are there for all Americans to take pride in and for all the world to note. Our national economy in the United States is growing stronger and stronger, more prosperous and more prosperous every day. Both the business community and your own families can plan ahead with a new-found certainty and a new-found security. The economic indicators are pointing day after day after day to better and better news as far as this country is concerned.', 'Almost every segment of our society, of our economy is rebounding in a strong, dynamic, encouraging way. We are on the road to a new prosperity in America, and we are not going to be sidetracked now by anybody, period.', 'Let me point out a few of the facts and factors that make this country strong and our future great. Employment has gone up--86,700,000 Americans are working today, and that means more Americans are gainfully employed right now than ever before in the history of the United States. It also means that we have gained over 2,600,000 jobs in the last 12 months, and this is progress by any standard.', ""Unemployment, it's going down--not as fast as I would like, but it's moving again in the fight direction. And I'm not going to let up in fighting this unemployment problem until every American who wants a job can find a job. That's what we want."", ""During 1974, inflation was raging at an annual rate of more than 12 percent. But the Department of Commerce--and this is the best news we have gotten-announced just last week that the Consumer Price Index 'rose at an annual rate, for the first 3 months of 1976, at the lowest rate in 4 years--less than 3 percent. We have cut the rate of inflation in the last 20 months 75 percent, and that is progress, and we are going to make some more."", 'But what is more encouraging is that the consumer sentiment index--how you and your family and your neighbors look at the future--is double that of a year ago. Real earnings for the average American worker have risen significantly, well above the rate of inflation, and that means that your purchasing power is on the increase.', ""We have achieved this economic recovery through the commonsense steps that I initiated at the outset of the recession--tax cuts for individuals, tax incentives for business expansion and job production, and extended income cushions for those unfortunate Americans that were out of work. The price of America's economic recovery was not a new round of double-digit inflation; it was not another frustrating experience with wage and price controls, nor was it billions and billions and billions of extra dollars from the Federal taxpayer."", ""I think you know where I stand on the question of unnecessary Federal spending. As Senator Tower knows, I vetoed 48 bills since becoming President-and I want you to listen to this because it's very critical--in 20 months I vetoed 48 bills sent to me by an irresponsible Congress, and I vetoed those bills because I knew they were wrong. And the Congress of the United States has sustained 39 out of those 48 bills that I vetoed, and the net result--and this is what's meaningful to all of you--we have saved $13 billion by those vetoes. And let me add a postscript, if I might. I will continue to veto those extravagant spending bills again and again and again and again."", ""As I look around this wonderful audience and see husbands and wives and wonderful citizens from the great city of Dallas, I know that each and every one of you have to keep your own financial house in order. And you have every right to expect that the Congress of the United States will do exactly the same thing with the Federal Government, and if they don't, you know what to do November 2."", ""Now, if we can hold the line on Federal spending, if we can keep the budgetbusters in the Congress under control, let me make you a promise; it's a promise that I will keep during the next 4 years. If we can keep the budget-busters in Congress under control, with your help we will give you another major tax decrease within the next 2 years."", 'In order for us to have the kind of economy that we want, I think we have to get tax reduction; we have to have a hold-down on the rate of growth of Federal spending. And what does this mean? It means more jobs for more Americans. And I want those jobs to be in the private sector, where you who work have a permanency, an incentive. And we all know that five out of six jobs in this country are in the private sector. Those kinds of jobs give you a pride with the paycheck. We want a sustained economy in America not only a goal for each of you but a goal for this country.', 'But economic progress is not the only progress that we have made. Today, America is at peace. Today, there are no Americans fighting in any place in the world whatsoever, and I will keep it that way.', 'I believe firmly in peace through strength. We will stand tall and strong and keep our powder dry so the United States can negotiate from a position that commands respect and invites cooperation from our adversaries.', 'I have taken firm, firm steps to ensure that our alliances are strong, our commitments are worthwhile, and our defenses are without equal. I have proposed the two largest defense budgets in the history of the United States, reversing a trend that was reducing our defense expenditures year by year to levels that were dangerously low.', 'The price of our national defense may be high--but let me speak very personally to each and everyone of you--the price of freedom is one Americans have always been willing to pay in blood, in sacrifice, and in treasure. We are no less willing to pay that price in America today to keep our Nation secure.', ""But America's security rests more than on armaments alone. Our ultimate strength is the spirit, the love of freedom, the pursuit of justice, the commitment to progress which Americans have shared for 200 years."", ""We live in a nation that is the envy of the world and, frankly, I am darned sick and tired of hearing from some people that America is on the downgrade. It isn't true. I believe in America, as you do. I believe in its strength, as you do. I believe in its purpose, as you do. I believe in its goodness, as you do. And most of all, we believe in what we stand for. We can be proud, we can be proud that we are Americans, and we are proud of America."", 'Working together, you and I, we can look to an even brighter future for our children and their children. We can see an America in which all men and women live in dignity, in security, in harmony, and in peace. We can see people taking pride in their work and finding pleasure and purpose in their lives.', 'We can see an America in which government is the capable servant, not the master of its people. We can see an America which cherishes those wonderful old values of honesty, compassion, determination, and courage. We can see an America in which those great dreams that we have all had will come true.', ""That's my goal. And that is why I am asking for your support in the challenging years ahead, so that I may have an opportunity to serve each and every one of you with strength, with support, with dignity, and success."", 'I thank you very, very much.']"

He has been with me in the 3½ days that I have been in Texas and no one could have been stauncher, more steadfast, and more loyal; and more effective, I might add, because so many people in Texas respect John Tower, and for good reason. Thank you very, very much, John."", ""I also want to thank each and every one of you who are working for the President Ford Committee. I know how much time it takes and how much effort it is, and I can't express deeply enough my gratitude and appreciation."", 'But, as Senator Tower said, if we win in Kansas City, I can be elected in November. I am the Republican candidate that can be elected and can carry through on the moderate conservative policies that we believe in. So, that is why Texas is so important, that is why other States are so critical.', 'So, I thank you for the efforts in getting the nomination, which I think will be very influenced by the decision tomorrow. I want to represent the Republican Party and win for the Republican Party, and the philosophy that it stands for, and I can. And I believe no other Republican candidate can win.', 'And let me tell you very quickly why I think we can win on the basis of policy and programs. You know that we have taken this economy when it was in the depths about a year ago and we brought it up so that we are now on the road to a healthy, continuous era of prosperity. I know that the women here particularly are affected by the cost-of-living increase.', 'Think back to August of 1974. The cost of living was escalating at that time at the rate of 12 percent or better and in the month of March, in the month of February, and in the month of January this year, a 3-month period, we had cut the rate of inflation to under 3 percent. That is a 75-percent decrease or reduction in the rate of inflation in this country.', 'I think that is a great achievement and we have done it because we have been strong in dealing with the Congress, vetoing 48 bills, getting 39 of them sustained, and saving $13 billion. That is the kind of strong, effective, anti-inflationary program that we have undertaken.', 'And you could take a look at the number of jobs. A year ago we were in the depths of a serious recession. In the meantime, in 12 months, because we had the right policies, we have added 2,600,000 more jobs in America. We are now up at the highest rate of people gainfully employed in this country, 86,700,000.', 'But, I am not satisfied because there are too many people unemployed. We are doing well, but I want a situation in this country where everybody who wants a job and will look for a job can have a job. That is the kind of economy we want in America today.', 'Now, let me make one comment that I think all of us who are dealing in the facts--and particularly those of us who have to go out and meet the comments made by my challenger or you who meet the individuals who are supporting my challenger--my challenger has raised the issue about whether or not our military capability was sufficient. He is alleging that we are number two.', 'First, that is totally inaccurate, but as to his credibility to make that charge, let me make this observation. On November 20 of last year, when he announced his candidacy in Washington, D.C., he was asked a question by one of the reporters at that press conference whether or not he could recommend a figure that would \'be adequate for our defense appropriations. It just happens that that answer is a matter of record, and here is what my opponent said. ""I didn\'t say what I wanted to spend. You have me in a position in which the answer is very difficult because I think only when you are in that position of command do you have access to all of the information that is necessary for making that decision. Obviously, I am not in that position and do not have that information at this moment.""', 'Then he went on following another question by a reporter and said, ""One has only to face the fact that there are facts not known to you which cannot be known to you because of classification, and this always must be kept in mind as a reservation about any opinion that you might render.""', ""What, in effect, he is saying is he didn't have enough information to make a judgment or to make a recommendation as to how much money we ought to have for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, or Marines, and now, a few months later, he is saying we are not spending enough money, that our program is inadequate."", ""I think this affects his credibility very seriously as to whether or not he can be an honest critic of the status of our defense program. And, so, I think we ought to say if you know what the facts are, you can be critical, and you can have a program, but he charges we are number two and admits himself he doesn't have enough information to make a valid accusation."", 'So, I say we are on the way because we have a good program, a program of strength for America, a program of success for our economy, and I believe as the momentum between now and 7:00 p.m. tomorrow night, we are going to surprise him, we are going to make this race one that we can win.', 'Thank you very, very much.', ""I thank all of you on behalf of Betty and Jack and Mike and Steve and Susan and myself for what you have done, and I am deeply grateful for the sacrifice and effort that each of you have made. We won't let you down. I will make sure of that."", 'Thank you very much.']"

[Laughter] Although you are a Buick dealer and my name is Ford, I have a great, great interest in a prosperous and healthy automobile industry. But as strongly as I feel the automobile industry is a great contributor to our economic well-being, I would respectfully suggest that 1976 is not a good year for all of you to trade in your Ford for another. [Laughter]', ""I was telling Billy Taylor earlier that a good many years ago I was an active member, a very devoted participant in the Jaycees in my home town of Grand Rapids, Michigan before World War II and then 4 years later when I came back and was for several years before reaching that age limit.

I know you have done a great job--phone banks and every other way to get out the maximum amount of votes that we can get in this area.', 'I am tremendously encouraged by not only the quality of people I see here but the energy and enthusiasm. When we came here first about 3 weeks ago and I spent a few days in Texas, came back, I had the feeling that we were definitely an underdog. But as I have gone from Longview, to Tyler, to Fort Worth, to Houston, to Dallas, to Conroe, here to Lubbock, and we are leaving shortly to go to Abilene, I get a totally different feeling.', 'We have the momentum going, and we believe that it is going to be a very nip and tuck, very close contest.', 'But with the momentum that we have, with the kind of leadership that we have under your great senior Senator John Tower and the quality and the energy that all of you have, I think the basic programs that we have both domestically as well as internationally and militarily, we are going to come right up to that edge and we can tip it over if we make a maximum effort between now and when the polls close tomorrow night.', 'Let me just say this: This administration, from the very outset, has adopted one very basic policy. We would promise only that which we believe we can deliver and we will deliver everything we promise. That is what the American people want, and that is what this administration will do for the next 4 years, just as we have done it for the last 20 months.', ""Now, let me talk for just a minute about some of the sales pitch that I think you can honestly make as you talk to your friends, whether it's by phone or otherwise. Just refresh your memory a minute back to August of 1974. At that time, we Were suffering inflation of about 12 percent or more. The reports came out just a week or so ago which indicated that the rate of inflation, for the first 3 months of 1976 was under 3 percent. That's a 75-percent reduction in the rate of inflation, and that's a darned good record, and we ought to be proud of it."", 'If you will recollect, just about a year ago today the unemployment was high, employment was falling, but in the last 12 months, we have increased employment in this country by 2,600,000 people. The net result was for the month of March, we had an employment record of 86,700,000. More people were gainfully employed in the United States in the month of March than at any time in the history of the United States. That is not a bad record, either.', 'Probably the most significant factor as we take a look at what we are trying to do to get this economy on a healthy, permanent basis--a year ago the consumer confidence in America was at an almost all-time low, but because we had some sound policies, because we pursued them with persistence and diligence, today the consumer confidence is more than double what it was a year ago.', 'In other words, people are now beginning to feel that they have confidence in investing in a new car, a new home, or investing in America, period. This is the basic reason why I am absolutely confident that this movement in the economy is all for the plus and it is going to be a sound, constructive economy, not just one of these peaks and valleys.', ""So, we can say with confidence that the Ford administration's policies were right. We stood off the Congress when they wanted to load up the Federal payroll, when they wanted to spend more and more money. We have vetoed 48 bills, they sustained 39, and the net result is we have saved the taxpayers of this country $13 billion. That is not a bad record, either."", 'Let me indicate also that I think this administration can be given a very high mark for decisive action. First, we had the courage as well as the wisdom to veto the so-called common situs picketing bill, and that is progress, in my judgment. Then I think it is well to point out when we were faced with a challenge by a nation that seized one of our merchant vessels just about a year ago, the Mayaguez, this administration took firm, decisive action and we recaptured the Mayaguez as any good, strong country ought to.', 'So, I think we are on the right track both domestically and internationally.

There had been a loss of confidence. Number two, we were experiencing at that time over 12 percent inflation. We were literally on the brink of the worst economic recession that this country has had for 40 years with unemployment about to go up and employment about to go down. We were still engaged in a conflict in Vietnam, some 8,000 miles away. I was faced with a Congress which was very hostile. I was faced with--well, many, many problems both at home and abroad.', ""And I think we can say with all honesty and sincerity that this country has made a lot of progress in the last 20 months. Let's take each item."", ""I think the American people know that honesty, integrity, faith in Government has been restored in the White House. The facts and figures tell you what has happened in the economy. Instead of inflation of over 12 percent per year, for the first 3 months of 1976, the rate of inflation on an annual basis is under 3 percent. That's a 75-percent reduction in the rate of inflation. I said we were literally on the brink of the worst economic condition in this country in 40 years. Shortly thereafter, unemployment went up, employment went down, and just a year ago, we were in the depths of this recession. But what has happened in the last 12 months?"", 'We have gained 2,600,000 jobs. We are now employing in the private sector, in the public sector, more people today than any other time in the history of the United States--86,700,000.', ""Wherever you look throughout our economy, whether it's the automobile industry, whether it is in industrial production, whether it's in spendable income, everything that ought to be going down is going down, and everything that ought to be going up is going up."", ""So, we're doing darn well. Yes, we had a sad and tragic development in the Pacific--South Vietnam. But let me say this: We have strengthened our alliances with our friends in Western Europe, with Japan. But what is the judgment as to whether or not a policy of international relations has been successful? We haven't given up a thing. We're at peace, and we're going to keep the peace, because we have the strength to do it."", ""Now, we've had a few emotional issues raised in this campaign, and as Jack Edwards said this afternoon--Jack is on the Defense Subcommittee on Appropriations. He knows it. He has lived with it as a member of that committee. Incidentally, I served on that committee 14 years before I became the minority leader. So my background and information on our national security program is not just a campaign rhetoric operation, but it's predicated on some background and knowledge over a long period of time."", 'But take the words of Jack Edwards, one of our outstanding Members of the Congress. Jack Edwards said the charge is a phony that this country is not fully capable, fully able to meet any challenge. And what is our mission? Our mission is to deter aggression, to maintain the peace, and to protect our national security. Jack Edwards says the challenge of that is a phony issue, and I agree with him.', 'And then we have had the problem raised by our good friend, who says something about the Panama Canal. You know his words, but did any of you happen to hear Barry Goldwater yesterday on ""Meet the Press""? Well, I unfortunately don\'t have in my possession the text of Barry Goldwater\'s interrogation on ""Meet the Press."" But he was asked this question: ""Who is right, the President or ex-Governor Reagan on the Panama Canal?"" Barry Goldwater said, ""On this I have to agree with President Ford, and I think that the Governor would agree with him, if he knew anything about the question.""', 'Just so there\'s no misunderstanding, let me give you the exact words. Here is the question from Miss Mackin [Catherine Mackin, NBC News]: ""On the Panama Canal, who is right on that? Whose position do you support, Ford\'s or Reagan\'s?"" Senator Goldwater--and I quote precisely--""I have to support Ford\'s position on it, and I think Reagan would, too, if he knew more about it.""', ""So, let me just conclude with this observation: We have a record that's good, of taking our country from a very serious crisis and making this country prosperous-on the road to prosperity of a greater and more stable basis than this country has had in a long, long time.

We strengthened our alliances."", ""And let me just add this: We are keeping the peace with an all-volunteer army, and we aren't calling on the draft for the support of our Military Establishment."", 'Let me thank each and every one of you for what you have done and what--as one of your good statewide chairmen has said--what you are going to do in the next 28 hours.

Let me tell you as succinctly as I can, the selling points that I think make sense."", 'Number one, when I became President there was a great loss of confidence in government and, in particular, the White House.', 'Number two, we were on the brink of the worst economic recession this country has had in 40 years. Inflation was 12 percent or greater. Unemployment was about to go up, and employment was about to sink. What has happened? We have restored confidence and faith, I think, in the White House.', 'Number three, the rate of inflation has been cut by 75 percent. The first 3 months of this year, the rate of inflation on an annual basis was under 3 percent. In the last 12 months, when we hit the bottom of the recession, we have gained 2,600,000 more people on the payroll of the private enterprise system of this country. We now have 86,700,000 people gainfully employed, the highest number in the history of the United States.', 'So I think we have a lot to talk about, and we are not going to be overwhelmed by some of the emotional appeals that have been made by some people.', 'I thought Jack Edwards, who really knows something about the defense program of this country and what we have in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marines, because of his very unique experience on the Defense Appropriations Committee--and Bill Dickinson is also on the House Armed Services Committee, and I am sure that Bill agrees entirely with Jack Edwards that all of this talk about the United States military being second--it is nonsense.', 'Furthermore, both Bill and Jack can tell you categorically, a year ago I submitted the highest military budget in the history of the United States. And this year I also submitted the highest military budget in the history of America, increasing the funds by 14 percent.

In retrospect, I think he was right.', 'But here is the transcript of Barry Goldwater\'s interrogation on ""Meet the Press"" yesterday, and there is one issue that has been raised. I think I have tried to get the record straight, to give the facts, but sometimes another person can do it better than yourselves.

Senator Goldwater, in response: ""I have to support Ford\'s position on it, and I think Reagan would, too, if he knew more about it.""', 'So, what I am saying--we have got an affirmative record. We should be proud of it, at home and abroad. We also have the answers to the charges that have been made in the political campaign.

We faced a crisis of confidence in government, and that confidence and that integrity in the White House have been restored.', ""The challenges of the future will be even greater. Today's generation of Americans must face those challenges as our parents and as our grandparents met theirs--with courage, with sacrifice, with determination, but always with love of our country and our God."", ""God bless all of you. All of you here today and all the other Americans throughout Alabama and all over America, it's my great honor to be your President. With your faith and your support we will fill the future with hope, with great achievement, and the progress that will keep America number one for generations to come."", 'Thank you very, very much.']"
55,Gerald R. Ford ,"May 07, 1976","[""It's great to be back in my native State. And it's wonderful to have an opportunity to give a message to my many friends and supporters here in Nebraska and to say to them that the fight to achieve the Presidency for the next 4 years begins anew right here in Nebraska, and it's a fight that's going to be continued until we prevail and are successful in Kansas City in August of this year."", ""It's a fight that will ensure the continuation of policies that have brought us from the depths of a recession to a new level of prosperity in America. It's a fight that's going to continue the policies of rolling back the bureaucracy, the red tape in Washington, D.C. It's a policy that will preserve and continue the peace that we have and the peace that we must keep for the future. It's a policy that will lead to the continuation of faith and trust and confidence in the Presidency itself."", ""As I said, this is a campaign that is beginning anew. It's a campaign that's essential for the continuation of the policies of the last 2 years that have been successful. A mandate would be very helpful in maintaining the momentum that we now have for peace, prosperity, and trust. It's a campaign and a fight that will lead to success here in Nebraska and success in Kansas City in November for the country as a whole.""]"
56,Gerald R. Ford ,"May 08, 1976","['First, I want to thank from the bottom of my heart Carl Curtis and Roman Hruska, both of them have been with me since I arrived in the State of Nebraska yesterday. They have not only been great Senators for you here in Nebraska but they have been giving great leadership to my campaign in Nebraska, and I thank Carl and Roman for their service to your State and to our country and their support for me.', 'But I also want to thank very deeply all of you who are volunteers, who have worked hard and are doing a good job in making sure that we win on Tuesday, and we are going to win.', 'But we have about 72 hours and that is not too much time to double and treble your efforts. I know you have worked hard. I know you probably are a little fatigued, but you win a ballgame by that last effort in the last quarter, and this countdown is vitally important. So, I urge you to maximize your efforts in the hours ahead. And as you meet your friends, talk to your neighbors, your farmer neighbors or your city neighbors, your professional friends or those who are in churches with you, let me give you in a capsule form what I think are the best selling points. They can be put in the label of prosperity, peace, and trust.', ""Let's take each one very quickly. Prosperity--refresh your memory--21 months ago this country was suffering inflation at the rate of 12 percent or more and for the first 3 months of 1976 the rate of inflation is 3 percent or less. That is a 75-percent reduction in the rate of inflation and that is not a bad batting average by any standard."", 'Refresh your memory--a year ago the doomsayers were saying we were on the brink of a depression. We were in a recession. We admitted that, but instead of panicking, instead of getting hysterical, we took a firm, steady, right course, and the net result is we are now having, according to the latest figures published yesterday, 86,400,000 people gainfully employed, the most in the history of the United States.', 'In those statistics that were released yesterday--two very impressive figures. We gained 700,000 jobs in one 30-day period, and in addition, from last April to this year we made a total gain of 3,300,000 jobs. The policies that we had, the programs that we followed, produced this kind of result.', 'So, the Ford administration can take credit for it, and we ought to be proud of it. It ought to be a big selling point for us when we go to the polls, or you all go to the polls on next Tuesday.', ""Now, one other point. I said indirectly to the students at Nebraska, the graduating class, they were the first class in 30 years--30 years--that could graduate and have a choice whether they wanted to go into the military or whether they didn't. This is the first time in 30 years that young people graduating from a university or a college would not be faced immediately with a mandatory obligation under selective service. And why have we been able to give them a choice--either they could volunteer or they could go into their occupation--was because we have the right military and diplomatic policy. We are at peace."", 'And let me give you another several points. I am the first President seeking election or reelection in the last 20 years who can say that the United States is at peace. So, when you put it all together, our policies diplomatically, militarily, have been right. We have the peace, and we are going to keep it because we are right.', ""And then if you will take the third word, trust. I think since I have been President, August of '74, we have had an open, we have had a candid, we have had a forthright administration. The door was never closed to any individual or to any group, we have been frank and honest with the American people, and the net result is there has been a restoration of confidence in the Presidency. And that is something that was necessary, something we can build on."", 'So, on the basis of those three words, prosperity, peace, and trust, I think you can talk to your friends and neighbors and say that Jerry Ford ought to be the President of the United States for the next 4 years.']"
57,Gerald R. Ford ,"May 12, 1976","['Thank you very, very much, Congressman Bill Broom field, Governor Milliken, former Governor Romney, Senator Bob Griffin, distinguished Members of the House of Representatives, Mayor Staples but, more particularly, all of you wonderful people from the city of Birmingham and Oakland County:', ""Thank you very, very much. You don't know how nice it is to come back home on a beautiful day in May and to see so many wonderful people who are here because they want to hear a story about what we have done and what we're trying to do and what we intend to do in the next 4 years."", 'Let me just quickly refresh what we faced when, in August of 1974, I became President. This country had gone through some very serious economic times with inflation up to 12 to 14 percent. We were on the brink of a very serious economic recession, the worst in 40 years. We were on the precipice of unemployment going up and employment going down. But the facts are that what we did was to restore confidence. What we did was not push the panic button but to have faith in the American people that, if we kept our cool in Washington, this country would turn around and be what it is today--on the uphill, on the real movement toward the kind of prosperity that we must have and will have. And we did it because of you.', ""And then let me point out to you what we've done in that area. Employment is up 3½ million more than last year. The last-report showed that we had 87,400,000 people working in America--the highest figure in the history of the United States."", ""And instead of 12- or 14-percent inflation, we have cut it over 50 percent. For the first 3 months of 1976, it's less than 3 percent. So, let me quickly summarize it. Everything that should be going up is going up, and everything that should be going down is going down. America is on the verge of a boom, and that's what we want and that's what we worked for."", ""But let me quickly refresh your memory to what was the circumstance in August of 1974 as far as peace. Yes, after the trauma of 1973 and early '74, our allies abroad were worried about the will and the resolution of the American people. Our adversaries were uncertain as to whether we were going to be weak or strong, and whether they could or should exploit the situation here at home. But what the Ford administration did was first, to restore the faith of our allies in the strength of America and the resolution of 215 million Americans strong, deep believers in our form of government that is the best by any standards in the history of mankind."", ""And let me say this as we move ahead. There have been some individuals who have attempted to downgrade this country's capabilities in a military and diplomatic way. But what is the standard by which you judge the way we handle our foreign affairs and the way we handle our military capability? The objective of all of it is the achievement and the maintenance of peace. And we have peace today. And I am proud to say to every one of you, that I am the first President in 20 years who can go to the American people seeking election or reelection, who can say that America is at peace. The fact that we are at peace is because we are strong and because we are resolute. And we are going to stay that way by strengthening our relations with our allies and convincing our adversaries that America means what it says."", 'But let us turn now to the last fact that I think we ought to take a look at. In August of 1974, there had been a shocking series of scandals in the highest offices in our land, and the American people had lost a lot of confidence in their government. And the net result was we had to restore that confidence.', 'The Ford administration has been open, it has been candid, it has been forthright. And I can look every American in the eye and say that we have worked at the restoration of confidence and the strengthening of integrity in the White House. And I can be proud of the fact that as we travel around the country, people have faith in the path of integrity and honesty that this administration has tread for the last 21 months.', 'I have talked about the past, I have talked of where we are going, and the three main areas that it seems to me is how you should judge how you vote on next Tuesday--peace, prosperity, integrity or trust.', 'But what we have to do is to make sure that those policies are in our vision and will be our efforts for the next 4 years. I can assure you that with your support on next Tuesday and with your support in November, we can continue those high, strong resolutions that we have had of peace and prosperity and trust.', ""But why do we want to do it? And I think that's a good question with so many wonderful young people here this afternoon. It has been the tradition, it has been the heritage of America that we do things for those that follow. Our forefathers did it for us. They sacrificed and they made a better America for all of us. And those of you who can go to vote on next Tuesday, I think you ought to look at what you want for America for the next 4 years--not for yourself, necessarily, but for these young people whose stake in the world is what you can strengthen and the opportunity for them which you can strengthen."", 'I ask you on the basis of performance--the achievement and the maintenance of peace; prosperity; a progress out of a recession toward a healthy and prosperous economy; and the restoration of trust in your Presidency--I ask for your help and assistance, performance versus promises. And what we have done in 21 months we can do even better for you and yours in the next 4 years.', 'Thank you very, very much.']"

And let me tell you right now, I won't let you down for the next 4 years."", ""Now, in this campaign, we have heard a lot of rhetoric. We have had a lot of criticism. We have had a lot of quick-fix answers. But let me tell you this: Jerry Ford calls them straight, and Jerry Ford isn't going to promise you anything that he can't produce and he will produce everything he promises. Now, let me talk about three things--peace, prosperity, and trust."", 'As President of these United States, I am proud to be able to stand here and tell you that our country is at peace. We are at peace because we are strong, we are respected. And I can assure you that for the next 4 years, we are going to keep strong, we are going to keep at peace, and we are going to do it because we are respected.', ""But let me talk for a minute now about prosperity. Let's take just a minute to go back and find out what the circumstances were when I became President, 21 months ago. We were experiencing 12- to 14-percent inflation. Do you know what it was the first 3 months of 1976? Under 3 percent. That's a 75-percent cut."", ""Shortly after I became President, we started on this unfortunate bandwagon of a recession. But let me tell you, in the last 12 months, because we have had the right policies, because we didn't panic, because we did constructive things, we are making real headway towards prosperity on a permanent, solid basis. And give me 4 more years, and I will produce it for you."", 'Now I know the great State of Michigan, which I love, and the people that I really feel close to have had a tough time the last 12 months. But you have had great leadership in Governor Bill Milliken; you have had a good congressional delegation headed by Senator Bob Griffin. And then let me tell you, because of their help and cooperation, I have been able to do some things that kept us on the track from the depth of that recession to where we are going uphill and where we added 710,000 more jobs in this country in the last month and 3,300,000 more jobs in the last year. And we are going to get a lot more for Michigan in the months ahead.', 'But you know we have had a little trouble, or I have had, with some people down in Congress. When we started to go on this difficult economic situation, there were some people in Congress that said, ""Spend a lot of taxpayers\' money, add a lot of jobs to the Federal payroll, do all the things that might in the short run, but in the long run would be bad.""', 'You know, they sent down 49 bills that I vetoed; 42 of those were sustained by Bob Griffin and some of the other people in the House of Representatives. We saved--listen to this now--we saved the taxpayers of this country, by those 42 vetoes which have been sustained, $13 billion. And if the Congress sends any more of those big spending bills that will add just billions and billions and billions to the deficit, increase the probability of inflation, this President will veto and veto and veto again and again and again.', ""One other thing. You know, with that $13 billion that we saved by those vetoes over a period of 21 months, that saved the average family $200. So, the Congress--the majority in the Congress, I should say--in my opinion, is finally learning a lesson, because they aren't going to roll over me in the next few months and they won't do it in the next 4 years, either."", 'But let me talk to you just a minute about trust. Let your mind go back to August of 1974. This country had gone through one terrible time. There was a loss of confidence in the Oval Office at the White House. There were scandals in the government. People had lost faith in this great country of ours and people in high places.', ""It wasn't easy to go in there after taking the oath of office, but I said at the outset, and if you will remember, I said we were going to be open, we were going to be straightforward, we were going to call them as we saw them, we were going to be candid and forthright. I have kept that pledge to you, and we'll keep that pledge for the next 4 years, just as well."", ""Now, as I look out through this audience and as I came in here from the outside, I saw some wonderful young people. And let me ask all of the parents here, what is our aim? What's our objective? What are we trying to do as we grow older and as we find our years slipping by? I know what I'm doing, and I think I can look at every parent right here and say to him, each and every one of us want to make a better world for our children and our grandchildren. That's what America is all about."", 'And when our forefathers came, or even when some of us in this audience might have come from foreign lands to the United States of America, the country of freedom and opportunity, the net result is that we have developed in America the greatest melting pot, the greatest mixture of people from all lands in the history of mankind.', ""There is an old saying, you know, that the beauty of Joseph's coat is its many colors. The strength of the character of America are the many people who come from many lands throughout this great world in which we live."", ""The ethnic heritage, the ethnic churches, the wonderful dedication that we have to our families and our churches and our clubs and our organizations, our schools, that tie to the things that we have been brought up to do and to love and to learn and to work at--and when you put it all in the pot and mix it up, we come from many backgrounds with many heritages. But that's what makes America the strong, powerful, kind, compassionate nation that we are, and that's why 215 million people can live in peace, can disagree, but still have that real depth of affection and love for America."", ""And let me say, if you will give me 4 more years, I'll promise you to go from the problems we had in August to the heights that America has never seen in the past, because that's what I want, that's what you want for your kids and my kids, and we can do it. I'll do it with your help."", 'Thank you very, very much.', 'You know, there is one thing I forgot to ask you. I need your votes next Tuesday. How many are going to vote for Jerry Ford?', ""I see a Democrat for Ford, an Independent for Ford, and there are a couple of Republicans for Ford here.

I am deeply grateful for your attendance and the wonderful music.', 'I am likewise most grateful that Governor Winfield Dunn is here. He was an outstanding Governor for you in the State of Tennessee for 4 years. He was one of the most outstanding Governors in the whole United States during the period that he served you in Tennessee. And it was my privilege and my honor as the minority leader in the House of Representatives to work with him on many, many projects involving your State and involving Governors throughout the country, and I thank you very, very much.', ""I am deeply grateful to my very good and very old friend, Howard Baker, for his endorsement. You have in Howard one of the outstanding Members of the United States Senate. Nobody in the Congress knows more than Howard involving the problems of energy, nuclear power.

And I thank you from the bottom of my heart, Howard, for your endorsement and your support."", ""Obviously, it's a great honor and privilege for me to be in Johnson City again. I was here in 1972 at a delightful and wonderful opportunity to meet many of you from Johnson City. I deeply appreciate Jimmy Quillen's generous and very, very strong support. I've worked with him in the Congress when I was minority leader all the time that we served concurrently. We're close personal friends. And he and I have worked together for 4 years for the medical school project of this community."", ""With this great crowd, it's just great to be in Johnson City, home of the Tennessee Buccaneers, the Science Hill Hilltoppers, the Constitution Hall Bandits, and the Independence Hall Rebels."", 'My message today to the people of Tennessee can be summed up in just a very few words. As much as I believe in a strong and prosperous American automobile industry, I am here to say this year there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to trade in your Ford on another model.', 'I have had the great honor and privilege to serve as your President now for more than 21 months. When I took office in August of 1974, America was faced with some of the most pressing and the most serious problems in its 200-year history. Our economy had gone haywire, with prices going up at an annual rate of more than 12 percent and with America on the brink of the worst recession in 40 years. Our national resolve to meet international commitments had been called into question by our allies and adversaries alike. There was great danger to peace in many, many areas throughout the world. Underlying these serious problems was a crisis of confidence in our government, especially in the White House.', ""There was a crisis of spirit among the American people, many of whom began to question whether our best days were already behind us. Twenty-one months later, the American scene has dramatically improved. That 12-percent inflation rate has been cut more than half. In fact, it's down to less than 3 percent in the first 3 months of 1976, and that's a 75-percent reduction, a good record. After seeing unemployment rise to nearly 9 percent just 12 months ago at the low point of that recession, we have recovered more than 3,300,000 jobs in the last 12 months alone--87,400,000 are on the job today throughout the 50 States, and that is more than ever before in the history of the United States. And I would say that's a pretty good comeback from where we were a year ago. Internationally, America is at peace with every nation on Earth. Not one American is serving in combat anywhere today anyplace throughout the world, and I intend to keep it that way."", ""The day that I took the oath of office as President of the United States I said that truth is the glue that holds government together. Twenty-one months later the record of my administration is one of candor, integrity, and openness. It's a record that has restored the people's confidence and trust in the White House, and it is a record that I'm very, very proud of."", ""The American people today are looking into the future with faith instead of fear, and that future can be as bright and as successful as we want to make it. Economically, we're on a course of steady growth and rising prosperity. We have done battle with the worst recession in 40 years and with the worst inflation in more than 50 years, and we've won."", 'Our next battle is with deficit spending by the Federal Government, and I have already begun that battle with 49 vetoes as my ammunition. Despite a supposedly veto-proof, two-thirds Democratic majority in the Congress, we got 42 of those vetoes sustained, and those 42 vetoes will save the American people $13 billion.', 'And if the Congress keeps sending me budget-busting bills down to the Oval Office in the White House, I will use my veto again and again and again. I will not be satisfied until we balance the Federal budget, and the sooner the better. My plan is to combine spending cuts with tax cuts and to reduce the growth of Government across the board.', ""We cut your taxes last year, and that led to a major increase in consumer spending, and that increase was a very major factor in our economic recovery. Last January, I asked the Congress for another tax cut of $10 billion starting July 1 of this year. But instead, it looks like the majority in the Congress wants to spend $17 billion more than I proposed, eliminating the tax cut, and increasing the national debt to $713 billion. That's the wrong program, and we've got to fight for my program."", ""And may I mention, among the tax cuts that I recommended to the Congress was an increase in the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000, and I can't understand why the Congress or a majority of them don't understand that the people in the middle-income area need that tax cut."", 'With the new budget that I proposed, we could cut the rate of growth in Federal spending by 50 percent and we can achieve a balanced budget by 1979. Now, if we can get a few more Howard Bakers, Bill Brocks, Jimmy Quillens, John Duncans, Robin Beards in the Congress of the United States, we can cut government spending, we can balance the budget, and we can win the battle. And I hope you will help us across the board.', 'The sound of real battle is only faintly heard in the world today after so many, many years of war. The United States can be proud of the role it has played in bringing peace to the world and in promoting the cause of freedom, of human dignity throughout this globe. We can play that role successfully because we are strong enough to command the confidence of our allies and the respect of our adversaries.', ""After years and years of lower and lower defense budgets imposed by the Congress, we have reversed that dangerous trend. I have proposed in the last 2 years--January of 1975, January of 1976--the two largest defense budgets in American history. And I hope that we finally convinced a majority in the Congress that it can't shortchange our national defense any longer. And we're going to win that battle against that Congress like we're winning the battle in the economy and for peace throughout the world."", ""The purpose of America's mighty arsenal is not to terrify the weak, to provoke armed confrontation, or to lay claim to that which is not ours. Our purpose is to defend freedom and to maintain a foundation. of strength on which to build a better and a safer world."", ""But our strength does not rest in our military power alone. Our major source of strength is the productivity and the success of the American farmer who, in the last 3 years, has enjoyed his highest net income in our Nation's history and whose exports have hit high, high records. Those exports have helped to put America back on the road to prosperity, and the farmer deserves the thanks of every American in every one of our States. That just doesn't mean the big farm operator; it means the small family farmer right here in east Tennessee, and I thank you all."", 'To preserve that family farm and other family enterprises, I have proposed to the Congress raising the estate tax exemption from $60,000 to $150,000. In addition, I have proposed stretching out those payments over a 25-year period at low-interest rates and, most importantly, exempting from taxation the transfer of property between husband and wife.', 'I want to see the family enterprises stay in the family rather than be sacrificed to pay the Federal tax collector. The family tradition, like the American tradition, is one of security, one of rich heritage, of pride and hope for the future.', ""There have now been eight generations of independent Americans, each one working, planning, and praying that life would be even better for the next generation than for theirs. In a very special sense, I want to continue as President because I want this generation of Americans to leave a better America to the next generation. I want to ensure that realistic, responsible policies are right for America, that have been proven right over the last 21 months, and to make sure that they continue. I want to maintain that peace that we now enjoy, to secure that peace through strength, and to make certain that the legacy of peace continues for our children as well as our grandchildren. I want to continue the policies of reliance on the private economy, of cutting taxes, and bureaucracies, and 'removing useless regulations and wasteful spending."", 'These policies have brought us back from the depths of a recession to a sustained recovery, and they can help to ensure that runaway inflation never again robs us or our loved ones of the rewards of honest work and lifetime savings.', ""Finally, I want to finish the most important job that I have begun--the restoration of faith and trust in the Presidency itself. The great institutions of government crafted with such great care by our Founding Fathers have their foundations in the people's trust. In the past 21 months, the foundation has been strengthened rather than shaken, and we will strengthen it more in the next 4 years. I did not seek this Presidency, but I will not shirk from its responsibilities."", 'Telling the truth is the secret to success in government, as in everything else. In my administration, we have faced many of the unpleasant facts of American life and we have dealt with them in a forthright and effective way. We have avoided making fancy promises and raising false hopes. And in the future as in the past, I will promise no more than I can deliver and deliver everything that I promise.', 'Peace, prosperity, and trust are the sum of my performance in the nearly 2 years since I became your President. They are a prescription for progress in America today, and they can be the greatest legacy any generation of Americans has ever left to its children.

So, he really means it. And I can see from the enthusiasm and the record that you have that we are going to do very well here. And it is not the record that I have, it is not anybody else, but it is the hard work on the telephone and in the precincts and every other way that you people do, and for that I am very, very grateful.', ""Now, let's think about what we have to do between now and May 25.

It is just a great organization of people that have either served with me in the Congress or I have known, such as Governor Dunn, when he was the Governor of your State and did so extremely well and who was the head of the Governor's Conference. These people have had an opportunity to observe, to see how I voted, how I talked in the Congress, what I tried to do, and their endorsement of me means a great deal."", 'So, I am deeply grateful to each and all of them, and I am equally appreciative of your willingness to be a volunteer out in the frontline because, as I said a moment ago, that is where the battle is won.', 'If I could give you a few words or a few ideas that you might use as you talk to your neighbors, to your business associates, to your friends, I can summarize it very quickly.', 'Why should Jerry Ford be the next President for the 4 years ahead of us? I think it is very simple. One, I have got a record. It is not predicated on promises with no experience; it is predicated on the basis of struggling with the Congress, on the one hand--not with Howard and Jimmy, but with those other fellows. [Laughter] It is experience in working with the Congress to get them to do something or to prevent the Congress from doing something. And I can tell you it is very helpful to be able to call people to help affirmatively, like Jim or Howard, or to ask them to stand with me when those goings are tough with the vetoes that we have.', 'Continuity in the office is important. Some of the things that we have to meet on a day-to-day basis relate to what happened in the past, and to have a little background is sometimes extremely helpful, both as to time and as to content. So, whether it is experience or continuity, those are important assets.', 'Number three, let me talk just a minute about the record. We try to summarize our achievements in three words--peace, prosperity, and trust. I think we have done a good job. We achieved the peace during the 21 months that I have been President. We have got it today, and we have the programs, both military and diplomatic, to keep it in the future. Let me point out, as Howard did on several occasions today, I am the first President in 13 years who can go to the American people and say our country is at peace.', ""There is one other point. The young people who are on college campuses, it is the first time in over 40 years that a young man graduating from college and/or high school isn't faced with mandatorily going into. Selective Service. We achieve our manpower requirements in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines by volunteers. And so we have a good military organization, but we also have the option for young people if they want to do otherwise."", ""Now, let's talk for just a minute about prosperity. You don't know how tough it was--I suspect some of you do. A year ago we had nearly 9 percent unemployment. A lot of people were saying, Mr. President, you have got to spend a lot more money; you have got to initiate a whole lot of new, costly programs with all kinds of new Federal bureaucracy; you have got to do a multitude of other things in a panic."", ""We didn't do it. We held the line. We vetoed 49 bills, 42 of them were sustained, and we saved $13 billion of the American taxpayers' money. That is our track record. Of course, I got a lot of help from Howard and Jimmy and some of the other staunch people, because we have to get a third in order to achieve that result--so we did."", 'What are the facts now? Twelve months after a serious drop into the depths of a recession we are on the way up, and everything that is supposed to be going up is going up, and everything that is supposed to be going down is going down. The rate of inflation has been cut better than 50 percent, and if you take the first 3 months of this year, we have cut it 75 percent from the high of 1974. We added 3,300,000 more people in our labor market in the last 12 months, including 710,000 in the last 30 days. So, the whole momentum is really surging for a good, prosperous future for this country, and I think I had something to do with it.', ""I have one quick other comment. They weren't very happy days to walk into the Oval Office on August 8 [9], 1974. The American people had lost a lot of confidence in our Government. You all know the reasons. It has been a long way up to where I think we have restored that confidence, and the restoration of that confidence was absolutely essential to get America moving again. America is moving, and I think the restoration of confidence, trust, integrity, candor, forthrightness has been a major factor."", 'Thank you very, very much.']"

And obviously, I'm particularly happy to be with you here this afternoon to participate in a small way in this wonderful Memphis new Mid America Mall, and I congratulate you."", ""The mall is a perfect example of what can be done to revitalize, to beautify one of our Nation's greatest cities. You did it with local funds through local effort and without the involvement of Federal money or Federal bureaucrats. Congratulations to all of you in Memphis."", ""As all of you know, we are headed into the final rounds of a contest which I believe will determine the direction of our country--how it will go, where it will go in the next 4 years. And I am especially grateful for the very kind words of Senator Howard Baker. And may I say parenthetically, it has been a great privilege and pleasure for me to work with him in his areas of special competence and expertise, whether it is in nuclear energy, matters involving intelligence, whether it's the whole spectrum of what is good for Memphis, what is good for Tennessee, or what is good for the United States, and I thank you very, very much, Howard."", ""I know Tennessee well enough from my many acquaintances here, as well as those in the Congress--I know Tennessee well enough to know that you appreciate straight talk. And that's what I'm going to give you here today, just like I have given it to the American people during the 21 months that I have hart the honor and privilege of being your President."", ""The day I was sworn in, I said our long national nightmare is over, and it is. We have totally dispelled the climate of darkness and despair that hung over Washington. And let me say, I won't let you down in the next 4 years. We will make the same strong record."", 'During this 21-month period, I have leveled with the American people. I said it in my second State of the Union Message, and I say it here again today: We will promise only what we can deliver, and we will deliver everything that we promise.', 'Consider, if you will, where we were in the very first weeks and months of my Presidency. Then some well-known labor and political leaders were predicting that the United States of America was headed into a depression and that only massive action by the Federal Government could avert tragedy. Inflation was over 12 percent. Unemployment was climbing, and we were heading into the worst recession in the last 40 years. But instead of listening to the prophets of doom and gloom, with their quick-fix solutions involving more big government, we pursued a ca]m, steady course of relying upon American energy and American enterprise, and we have produced results.', 'As a result, today we meet not in the gloom of a recession, but in the full surge of a steady, confident economic recovery not only in the State of Tennessee but in 49 other States. We have turned the country around, and we are on the road to renewed prosperity, mutual trust, and a lasting peace. We cut the annual rate of inflation by more than 50 percent. We increased employment in the last year by 3,300,000 new jobs in America.', 'In the last month, the month of April, we increased employment throughout the United States by 710,000. The index of consumer confidence--that is, what you here in this Mid America Mall believe--the index of consumer confidence is double what it was a year ago.', ""Now, our recovery just didn't happen--it took place because I rejected bigger spending, bigger deficits, and bigger government intervention. For example, I used the veto power 49 times, and 42 of those vetoes were sustained, saving the American taxpayer--that is you--$13 billion. And if you want to identify that $13 billion to each of you, that averages out to a saving of $200 per family that we saved by the vetoes and the help and assistance of Howard Baker, Bill Brock, Jimmy Quillen, Robin Beard. That is what we can do if we have the support of all of you, not only for me but for the good Members of the House and Senate who believe as you do and believe as I do."", 'I learned a very basic truth when I first came to the Congress, and let me give it to you, because I think it wraps everything into proper perspective: A government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.', 'But I also know that as a nation our best hope for a continued peace is to remain strong, and that way we can and we will preserve the peace. Throughout my 27 years of public service in the Congress and in the White House, my record is one of total commitment to a national defense equal to any challenge and a policy of peace through strength.', 'For 10 long years, the Congress has hacked away at the defense budget, cutting some $50 billion in this one period--a decade. Last year, this Congress cut almost $7 billion from the very first defense budget that I submitted as your President.', 'This year, in January, I decided that we were going to meet head-on the challenge of the Congress, and we were not going to let them undercut our national defense security and our military capability. So, I submitted a budget that would keep our Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines strong and capable of carrying out any of the missions assigned to them. And I am glad to report that the Congress this year is getting the word and is giving to us--to me, as President, and to you, the American people--the kind of funding that is required so that our men, whether they are airmen, sailors, marines, or soldiers, will have the equipment, the training, and the leadership to keep America able, totally committed to the defense of this great country.', 'Because we are at peace and because I think we must stay there, I am totally dedicated to maintain that peace that we now enjoy and to make certain that the legacy of peace continues for our children and for the generations to come.', ""With our Nation at peace, I am continuing the task that I undertook the the day that I became your President, which is the restoration of confidence and trust in our institutions, in ourselves, and in America's future."", ""The record of my first 2 years in the White House is peace, prosperity, performance in office, and trust. It is a record that I am proud of. It's a record that gives me the opportunity to ask you in good conscience, give me a mandate to keep peace, prosperity, restoration of confidence and trust in America."", ""The course that we take in the next 4 years will shape America's future. It's a course that must be piloted by a person who has got a steady hand, background and knowledge, a capability of dealing with the Congress, a course with a pilot who knows how to get the job done. And that job is very simple--the job of peace through strength, from recession to recovery, from fear to faith."", ""And with your help--and I ask you here in Memphis today and in Shelby County--I need, I want your help, and I won't let you down in the next 4 years.""]"

There was a loss of confidence in the White House itself. We were on the brink of an economic recession, the worst in 40 years, and inflation was at 12 percent or higher.

That is a good program, and I want you to support it.', 'With your help on Tuesday, we can send a message across the whole United States.

I think I have done a good job the last 21 months. Refresh your memory, if you will.', 'In August of 1974, this country was in a very difficult situation. For reasons we all know, the American people had lost their confidence in the White House. There had been scandals in very high places. We all know that we were suffering at that time from inflation at the rate of 12 percent a year, and we know that we were on the brink of the worst economic times in the last 40 years, a serious recession.', 'We also know that in August of 1974, our allies abroad were uncertain as to whether the American people and the American Government would meet its responsibilities on a worldwide basis, and our adversaries abroad were likewise uncertain as to their relationship with the United States.', 'When I took office on August 8 [9] of 1974, it was not an easy job.

We have got peace now, we achieved it in the last year, and we are going to keep the peace through strength in the years ahead.', 'Therefore, when you look at the record, I think it\'s a record that deserves support.

I think it is a good idea for President Ford, and we are going to win in 1976.', 'Thank you all very, very much.', '[6.] NILES (4:12 p.m.)', ""Let me just say it's been a great day. Betty will be out in just a minute. We kept going down this track, and right before Niles the sun came out. All of you wonderful people, thank you very, very much."", 'Well, as I said, Betty and I have had a wonderful day, starting in Flint and ending up here in Niles, on this whistlestop tour through the heartland of Michigan. The idea of this trip today I think took me back to a campaign by a great Democratic President, Harry S Truman, when he whistlestopped across the country, and a great Republican President, Ike Eisenhower, and both of them were successful. So, this train trip through the heartland of Michigan is going right on to Kansas City, and from Kansas City we are going to win in November.', 'Now, we have got a big election next Tuesday. I think we have done a good job in the last 21 months, and I want your vote next Tuesday.', 'Let me tell you what we have done in the 21 months that I have been President. Let your mind go back to the tough days in August of 1974. There had been a tremendous loss of confidence by the American people in our government, in the White House. We were on the brink of an economic recession, the worst in 40 years. Inflation was at the rate of 12 percent per year. In foreign policy, our allies were uncertain as to what we were going to do and our adversaries were in a position where they might have taken advantage of the uncertainty here at home.', ""When I took that oath of office on August 8 [9], the United States needed some leadership, both at home and abroad. We started out by setting forth what we were going to do to correct our economic problems. We have set a very steady course, and the net result was, inflation, which was 12 percent in 1974, is under 3 percent today. That's a good record, and we ought to be proud of it."", 'And then, a year ago, we were in the depths of a recession. Again, there were those throughout the country that wanted us to press a panic button--add a lot of people to the Federal payroll, approve budget-busting bills that would have increased the inflationary pressures.', ""But, instead, I decided that the right thing to do was to hold firm, to veto the kind of legislation that was sent down from Capitol Hill. And, as many of you know, I vetoed 49 bills; 42 of them have been sustained, and we saved the American taxpayer $13 billion. That's a darn good record."", 'But then, a year ago, we started our climb out of the recession. In 12 months, from last May to this May, we added 3,300,000 more jobs in America, 710,000 more jobs in May [April] of 1976. And the net result is that in May of this year we had 87,400,000 people gainfully employed in this country, an all-time record, and we ought to be proud of that.', 'But, the third point, the United States is at peace today. We have the military capability to maintain the peace. We have the diplomatic skill to convince our allies that we are strong and our adversaries that they ought to be respectful of the United States, which they are. We have got peace today, we are going to keep it, and if you give me 4 more years, we will keep it for 4 more years.', ""As you know, I had the great privilege of representing the Fifth Congressional District just a few miles north of here for almost 26 years. The policy that I followed for that period of time was that we had an open door, we were candid, we emphasized integrity, we were forthright, we called them as we saw them. We never promised more than we could deliver, and we delivered everything we promised. And that is the way we have run the White House for the last 21 months, and that's the way it will be run for the next 48 months if you give me the support that we need on Tuesday, and the support that we will get between now and November."", ""Well, Betty and I can't thank you all enough for being here at Niles and welcoming us warmly and giving us the opportunity to say a few words to you. We hope we have earned your support. We believe we have done a good job, and I ask you for your support next Tuesday so I can be the Republican representative in the great contest that will end on November 2."", ""I've worked hard. We've done the right thing. We've got America on the right track. We will keep it there. I can assure you that Jerry Ford, if you give me your support next Tuesday and next November, I won't let you down for the next 4 years."", 'Thank you very, very much.']"
63,Gerald R. Ford ,"May 15, 1976","[""Let me thank all of you for coming out today. Betty and I have had a very, very thrilling day going from Flint to Niles on a train, and then we just had a tremendous reception down at Holland at the Tulip Festival. But it's so nice to be back in Grand Rapids, our hometown. We have the First Mama with us, and we have Susan. You want a date, Susan? [Laughter]"", 'But as we were flying with the helicopter from Holland over to Grand Rapids, my memories went back to 1948 when I first made the gamble to run for Congress from the Fifth Congressional District. And at that time I appealed to a lot of Republicans. I appealed for support from a lot of Independents, and I asked for the help and assistance of a lot of Democrats. And the net result was I think I got a lot of all of them, and for that I am deeply grateful, because that was the beginning of my opportunity to serve the people of Grand Rapids, of Holland, Grand Haven, all of the Fifth Congressional District.', 'And now, some 27 years later, I am asking for the help and assistance of all of the people of this part of Michigan and the great State of Michigan. This includes all of the Republicans who believe in the philosophy and believe in the record that I have tried to carry out in 21 months. It includes all of the Independents in our great State of Michigan and the Democrats. And may I thank the Democrats who are here, including Dick Vander Veen,1 including the others who have been helpful over the years in supporting what we have tried to do for the Fifth District, the city of Grand Rapids.', 'This is our hometown, and when I think of the days at Madison School, the days at South High--of course Betty went to Central--but when I think of the wonderful people that have been so kind to all of us over the long, long period of time, we have done the best job we could, whether it was in Congress, whether it was Vice President, and for 21 months as President.', ""It's a great, great part of this country where we are now, and there are some wonderful people that we have tried to help, some wonderful people that we have tried to represent as best we could, and some people who have supported us through thick and thin."", 'Our hearts and our affection--they are all with you in this part of our great country. To see you all here on this sort of disagreeable night, it makes me-and I am sure Betty and Susan--feel like we are kind of welcome back home.', 'So, I thank you for all of the support over the years. I thank you for what you can do to help us on next Tuesday. We have never let you down. In the future-and we will never let you down in the future as President of the United States.', 'Thank you very, very much. It is nice to see you all.']"

Ford ,"May 16, 1976","['Thank you very, very much, Al Cederberg--my good friend Guy Vander Jagt, the Congressman from the western part of the State is here--George Olson, Mr. Ferguson, Mr. Kennedy, Reverend Beck, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:', 'May I say at the outset, I hope I have as many friends in this audience as George Olson and Al Cederberg have. [Laughter]', 'It is a great privilege and pleasure for Betty and Susan and myself to be here in Saginaw Township with so many, many fellow Michiganders, who are proud of their birthright and who are celebrating what is good and great about America. Saginaw Township--I have known from talking with Al Cederberg and others--is a young, vibrant community with a very real sense of purpose.', 'In the planning and the organization of the Bicentennial celebration, you have brought people together in a wonderful community spirit and a community effort, and for that I congratulate each and every one of you.', 'In the tradition of America, you have established new links between families and between neighborhoods. You have given your township what is so vitally important for so many communities that are searching for it, and that is the feeling of identity as well as a common purpose.', 'If I might say, in my own way in the Oval Office I have been trying to do precisely the same thing. On August 8 [9] of 1974, when I was sworn in as your President, I said to the American people our long national nightmare was over, and it is, my fellow Michiganders. In the last 21 months, we have dispelled the climate of darkness and despair that hung over this troubled Nation, and we have let the sunshine in.', 'I did not seek this office, as all of you know, but neither did I shirk from it, and I never will in the future. I said that I would promise only what I could deliver and deliver everything that I promised, and as you look back over the 21 months, that is precisely what we have done.', 'I said I would be candid and forthright, I would be open and frank with the American people, and I have been. I said that a policy of firmness and commonsense would bring us out of our economic recession; it has.', 'When I took office, inflation was running as high as 12 percent throughout our great country. The prophets of doom and disaster said we were on the verge of a collapse in America and that only massive Federal spending programs would save us.', ""Under the pressure from all sources, I didn't panic because I had a lot of faith in all of you, and I knew that you had the faith and the trust in me. I fought the attempts of many Members of Congress to spend more and more to create bigger and bigger deficits that would have led us to higher prices and more layoffs in our economy. Instead, despite the pressure from many sources, I vetoed 49 bills that Congress sent me, and thank goodness 42 of those were sustained, saving the American taxpayer $13 billion. If I could personalize it, it would save each family in America some $200, and that came in mighty handy."", ""But let me say this: The ballgame is not over yet; this session of the Congress is still going on. And I promise you that during this session of the Congress, I will hold this country on its course of full economic recovery by using my veto power again and again and again for our country's best wishes."", 'Why do I do this? I think the answer is very, very simple. I want to make sure that your tax dollars work as hard for you as you did for them. And I know how hard each and every one of you did work for those tax dollars, and your government better spend them just as well as you can spend them.', 'But as we trace the last 21 months, let me say a word or two. We have reduced inflation by more than half. We have increased national employment by 3,300000 people since last June. More men and women in America are working today, are gainfully employed than ever in the history of the United States--87,400,000. You have my promise that I am going to keep the pressure on until every American who wants a job has a job, a rewarding, permanent job with a real future instead of a dead-end, temporary, make-work job created by the government itself.', 'Let me say a word or two about taxes. I am no expert on the situation in Saginaw or otherwise in this area, but I can talk with some authority about the Federal Government. I promised to you that we would have a tax cut last year. We got it at the Federal level. I promised to you that we are going to work hard to get the Congress on July 1 of this year to give you another $10 billion tax cut.', 'Why do we do that? Because I have an abiding faith that you can spend your money much better than your government can for you and your family and your community. That is what we want.', 'If you look at the record, the middle-income people of this country have been shortchanged in the last few years by Federal tax policy. And in the recommendations that I made to the Congress in January of this year, the one, the quickest, the best way to change that was to propose that increase from $750 a person to $1,000 in personal exemptions.', ""You don't have to worry about Al Cederberg supporting that, but boy, put the pressure on the Congress, because that is the way we can give you and the middle-income people the kind of a tax break that you need and that you have earned and that you deserve."", 'May I say my administration is determined to stop the extension of government intervention, government interference, and government control in your daily lives. As a Congressman, as Vice President, and now as your President, I have never lost sight of one very basic fact: A government big enough to give you everything you want is a government big enough to take from you everything you have.', ""I have tried to follow a course as your President that has led to a strong and rising prosperity, a renewed trust, and a lasting peace. Throughout 27 years of my public service in the Nation's Capital, my total commitment was, is, and always will be a policy of peace through strength."", ""Because we are militarily powerful, because our national defenses are strong enough to meet any challenge, to carry out any mission, America is at peace today. We must maintain that peace. We must advance the prospect for peace among all nations and make certain that the legacy of peace continues for our children and our children's children in the years ahead."", 'Why do we sacrifice? Why have we of my generation, and the generations before us and the generations that have followed, sacrificed? We work hard. We save. We do our very best. It is to make the generation that follows us a happier, a healthier, a more prosperous generation. That is what my parents did, that is what I am trying to do for my children. And as I look at this great audience, I know that every grandfather and every grandmother have done it for their children, and you who have children today are doing exactly the same thing.', 'That is the history and the tradition of this great country, and this is what each one of us, as we make our decisions--whether it is in our work or our church or in our government--must say to ourselves: How can I make a better and better America?', 'So, as I come before you today, I seek a mandate from you to finish the very important job that I have begun and done the best that I could for the last 21 months--to complete the restoration of faith and trust in the Presidency of the United States.', 'I have been honest with you. I have been candid and forthright, and so is my campaign for the highest office in this great country. I am proud of my country. I am proud to be an American, just like every one of you are. And in the process of doing what we can, I want to lead our country away from a wasteful preoccupation with what went wrong with America and get on with the job of making things right in America.', 'You have shown here in this Bicentennial weekend, in everything you do in Saginaw Township, that love of country and belief in our ideals not only exist but thrive in the United States.', 'In the future, I see an America where the spirit fills each and every one of us with renewed confidence to face the challenges before us; an America dedicated to the simple but enduring values that give a nation and give its people integrity; an America where life is valued for its content as well as its comforts, and where government serves but the people rule.', 'If you share that vision of America which I have, I urge you to go to the polls next Tuesday, join with me in making this Bicentennial Year--not only in Saginaw Township but in all of the other 39 governmental areas in this great county--not only a year of celebration but of determination where, once again, we show the world that American dream which we all have had in our lifetime is best achieved when we are wide awake and where we, as Americans, are moving forward.', 'Think for a moment, if you will, some 200-plus years ago, some 3 million Americans fought for freedom in some 13 poor, poor Colonies. They took on a government 1,000 or more miles away, but they had the courage and the vision and the determination, and they won that battle for what we have today. And they gave us in this country the greatest Constitution, the most wonderful document for the governing of people in the history of mankind.', 'We believe in it. We can make it work. And the Bicentennial Commission [American Revolution Bicentennial Administration] and all the things that they are doing here in Saginaw Township and elsewhere give us the light, the hope, the vision for a better and better America.', 'Thank you very, very much.']"

My very first stop on this trip brought me right to Library Park in the city of Medford. I'm glad to be here. I know you are all glad to be here just because it's God's country."", ""It's been my privilege to travel in every one of our 50 States, and I found that some States have mountain ranges; some border on the ocean; some have very fertile valleys, broad forests, and sparkling rivers. And in some you can ski, and in others you can swim."", ""But here in Oregon you have it all. You were the first State in the history of America to hold primary elections, which I mention not only because of its historic interest but because it's a way of getting into the subject that I would like to speak to you about on this beautiful day here in Library Park."", 'I am asking my fellow Americans for their support because I have done a good job for the last 21 months under the most difficult circumstances. Because I have achieved and maintained the peace, moved America on the road to prosperity, and restored confidence and trust in the Presidency, I want a mandate next Tuesday from Oregon and the American people to finish that job in the next 4 years.', 'Consider for a moment where we were in the very first days and months of my Presidency. Take yourself back to August 8 of 1974. You will recall that some wall-known economists, labor and political leaders were predicting that we were heading into a deep depression, that unemployment would soon exceed 10 percent, that only massive action by the Federal Government could avert a tremendous catastrophe.', 'Inflation had soared to an annual rate of over 12 percent, interest rates were going through the roof, far, far too many Americans were laid off and could not find new jobs.', 'Just about a year ago, we hit the bottom of the worst recession in 40 years. Many were urging me in the White House to push the panic button. In the Congress, the economic downturn set off a clamor for huge emergency Federal subsidies, for more and more bigger Government programs, and higher and higher deficit spending.', ""The prophets of gloom were wrong, and I knew they were wrong when they were begging me to do this or to do that. We didn't panic in the Oval Office. I never lost sight of a deep conviction and belief that I have--I have had it all my political life--that a government big enough to give you everything you want is a government big enough to take from you everything you have."", 'We resisted the big spending schemes that would have caused larger and larger deficits and even more and more destructive inflation. We rejected the old political techniques of tax and tax, spend and spend, elect and elect.I vetoed 49 bills--42 of those bills have been sustained and the taxpayers of America have been saved $13 billion. And I will say parenthetically--not as a threat, of course--if the Congress sends me more of those terrible budgetbusting bills, I will veto them again and again and again.', ""In contrast to what some people were promoting, we pursued a calm, steady policy to ensure America's economic health, not just for a month or just for an election year, but over the long haul we had faith that America's system of private enterprise would regain its strength."", ""As a result, we meet here in this lovely park on this great day not in the gloom of a recession but in the full surge of economic recovery. 87,400,000 Americans are on jobs today, and this is an all-time record, and it's gone up month-by-month-by-month for the last 12 months. We have added almost 3,300,000 more jobs to the American economy since the bottom of the recession--3,300,000 more jobs than last May and 700,000 more jobs in the last month. I think this is concrete, significant evidence that we are well on the way to the kind of a recovery that we want and we will get."", ""Now, the special nature of Oregon's economy, its heavy reliance on the products of its wonderful forests have caused it to suffer heavily economically. And I am pleased that Oregon's economy has been steadily improving."", 'I stopped on the way in from the airport and had the opportunity of going through one of your great lumber mills. I was pleased to meet some of your fellow citizens from this community to see how they take the logs and make the lumber that we use all over the United States. You should be proud of those products. You should be proud of those people, and we are darned glad to get what you produce for us throughout the rest of the United States.', ""I will not be satisfied until every Oregonian and every other American who wants a job can find a job. That's what we're after. Since August 8 (9) of 1974, when I was sworn in, inflation has been cut by over half, and I intend to get it down ever further. You can look at the record--12 percent in August of 1974, under 3 percent in the first 4 months of 1976."", ""Now, in addition to America's economic stability and security, we are increasing America's national security. We have the best-equipped, best-trained, best-led fighting force in the world today, and they are all volunteers. That's a good record."", ""To make positive our military strength remains one of the major objectives, one of the major things that we are trying to do in Washington on your behalf, we must keep America's strength unsurpassed. And a way to do that, in January of last year and January of this year, I proposed the two largest military budgets in the history of America."", 'And let me say this: Within 4 years, and with a solid mandate from you, we can finish the job and make America truly secure for future generations.', 'I deeply appreciate this wonderful opportunity to come before you today and talk about the policies that I have implemented--returning the peace, increasing prosperity, restoring trust in the White House.', 'Today, America is at peace.

We cut Federal taxes last year, and I have recommended to the Congress another $10 billion tax cut to begin July 1, including an increase in the personal exemption from $750 per person to $1,000.', 'My policies have brought us from the depths of a recession to a sustained recovery, and will ensure that runaway inflation never again robs us or our loved ones of the rewards of honest work and lifetime savings.', 'I will pursue the steady course that has led us from war to peace, from a recession to recovery, from cynicism to confidence, from faith to fear (fear to faith).', 'Finally, I will finish the most important job--restoration of trust in the Presidency itself. I did not seek this office, but neither will I shirk it. I need your support to ensure peace, to restore prosperity, to restore the confidence that is so important for 215 million Americans.', 'The future really belongs to those who come after us. Americans have always wanted life to be better for our children than it was for us, because life for us has been better than it was for our parents.', 'What do I see ahead for this wonderful country of ours? I see a strong and confident America, secure in a strength that cannot alone be counted in megatons, an America rejoicing in riches that cannot be eroded by inflation or by taxation.

I was tremendously impressed in 1972, just like I am tremendously impressed here in 1976 by the energy and by the vitality, by the wonderfully warm and friendly reception that I am getting here, and I thank you very, very much.', ""Before coming to this part of the visit to Leisure World, I stopped and saw some of the people shooting pool, I stopped over and saw some of the people dancing and listening to music, I stopped by and saw that famous band of expert musicians, and it's just wonderful to see some friendly faces that I have met and to see some that I have seen over the years. It's obvious to me that Leisure World must be the busiest place in Orange County. [Laughter]"", ""I think what you have proven really is that retirement need not be a retreat from life but a fresh opportunity to do all the things that you have always wanted to do, and it's good to see each and every one of you taking full advantage of that great opportunity."", 'My message here today can be summed up in a very few words. As much as I believe in a strong and prosperous American automobile industry, I have come here to say that this year there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to trade in your reliable Ford for a flashier model. [Laughter]', ""But let me tell you seriously why I am asking you, my fellow Americans-not only from California but from all over the country--why I'm here to ask for your support. I'm doing it because I think I have done a good job under very difficult circumstances, because we have maintained the peace, we have moved America on the road to prosperity, and we have restored confidence and trust in the Presidency itself."", ""I'm coming to California, and I'm going to work hard going the length and the breadth of this great State to see as many people as I can and to give the message that I hope to give here, as well as elsewhere, because I want a mandate from California and a mandate from the American people in all other 49 States to finish the job that I started August 9, 1974."", 'I want to continue the assurance of dignity, the security and the quality of life experienced by our older Americans. For more than 40 years, America has made a very firm commitment of support for our older citizens in our society, not only for those who need help but those who have earned a retirement income during their working years.', 'As you all know, there are serious problems facing our social security system. These problems have been building up over the years and conveniently passed by and not attacked or not solved by either one administration or another, or one Congress or another. Unless my reforms that I recommended to the Congress in January of this year are adopted, the Social Security Trust Fund will run a deficit in this 12 months of $3,500 million, and the next year the deficit will be $4 billion, and the next year the deficit will be larger and larger.', ""It's unconscionable that the Congress has failed to face up to the hard facts of life. And believe me, let me assure you of one thing, very emphatically: My administration intends to preserve the integrity, the solvency of the social security system for your benefit and for that of all working Americans now as well as in the future."", 'Let me assure you, it would have been very easy in January for the Ford administration to duck the problem as others have. But I decided to prevent a decline in social security trust funds, which now pays out far more benefits than it receives in taxes. I proposed a small payroll tax increase--three-tenths of 1 percent--applying both to employers as well as employees. Under this plan, the largest increase for any person paying or any employer paying would be less than $1 per week.', ""It seems to me that this proposed tax increase, which will help to stabilize the trust fund, would give us the feeling of good conscience, doing the right thing regardless of any political consequences so that current and future recipients will be fully assured of the benefits that they have earned and that they are entitled to. And I believe that the American people, knowing that 33 million people have now earned and are receiving retirement benefits and literally millions will come into the same circumstances, this country made a commitment, this country must carry out that commitment. And the Ford administration isn't going to play politics with this problem."", ""And I add, as many of you I'm sure know, I recommended in my budget for the next fiscal year the full cost-of-living increase in social security benefits. I think this is the proper thing, the move that is required if we are to keep faith with those in our society who have earned and retired."", 'And let me say, I have also proposed major improvements in the Medicare program to make it serve you better. One of the most important improvements would provide for the full payment of all but a very small fraction of the cost of catastrophic illness and extended care.', ""There's no reason whatsoever that older Americans should have to go broke just to get well or to stay well in the United States of America."", 'Under my proposal the individual contribution to Medicare would go up slightly. But consider what the increase would provide. Nobody eligible for Medicare would have to pay more than $500 a year for hospital or nursing home care or more than $250 a year for physician services. Medicare would pay the rest. Whether it was $1,000, $10,000, or $50,000, I think it is a good program, and I would appreciate your support.', 'Our problem is the Congress. The ruinous economic burden of catastrophic illness is one thing, if this passes, you will never have to worry about again. And you deserve it, and the country ought to enact it, and it ought to be on the statute books.', ""Now, let me ask you or say to you, there are several other programs that I have requested that the Congress authorizes which should be of some special interest to older Americans. One would ease the burden of estate taxes. While the value of the dollar has eroded, our system of estate tax law has changed very little since the 1930's. To restore fairness and equity, I have proposed increasing the present $60,000 estate tax exemption to $150,000. And I have also proposed that if there is any tax yet remaining after the increase to $150,000, that the payments be extended over a period of 25 years with a very minimum amount of interest paid on an annual increment that you pay to the Federal Treasury."", ""But the third and probably the most important ingredient is how it affects married couples. At present, as many of you know, I'm sure, transfers of assets between husbands and wives are often subject to substantial taxation. I have proposed legislation which would make those transactions or transfers totally tax free."", 'This commonsense, equitable treatment of assets of a husband and wife is far too long overdue, and I hope and trust that the Congress of the United States will respond this year before they end their session sometime before the next election.', ""Now, if I had to sum up the record of my administration in just a few words it would be peace, which we have achieved and we're maintaining; prosperity, which we are accomplishing; and trust and confidence of the American people."", 'Today, America is at peace. Less than a year ago we were still at war. Today, we are at peace, and there are no American boys fighting anywhere on the face of the globe, and I intend to keep it that way.', 'I will maintain that peace, secure that peace through strength and perseverance, and leave that legacy of peace for our children and our grandchildren. We will accomplish it and pursue it because we have the military capability to carry out any mission that is required for the deterrence of aggression or to, under any circumstance, protect our national security.', 'Let me say the continuance of my policies of cutting your taxes, expanding the private economy, reducing bureaucracy and useless regulation, and restraining spending--these are the hallmarks of the Ford administration.', 'If you look back at the record of the last 22 months, my policies have brought us from the depths of the recession to a sustained recovery, and will ensure that runaway inflation never again robs us or our loved ones of the rewards of honest work and lifetime savings.', ""Let me ask you, do you recall in August of 1974 the cost of living was at a rate of 12 percent or higher? And it is good to report to you that for the first 4 months of 1976 the cost of living is rising at a rate of 3 percent or less. That's a 75-percent reduction in the cost of living. I think that's a darned good record that we should be proud of."", ""You will recall that shortly after I took office there were those prophets of gloom and doom who were saying that we were about to have a depression, that unemployment would go over 10 percent, that we had to do something with a quick-fix action, that the Congress had to spend more and more money with bigger and bigger deficits. I decided that wasn't the right course of action. I felt there was a better answer--to put a great deal of more faith and trust in the great economic system that has taken this country from 13 poor, struggling Colonies to the greatest nation in the history of mankind. So, we fought the Congress day in and day out."", ""Incidentally, I vetoed 49 spending bills; 42 of them have been sustained, saving the American taxpayer $13 billion. That's a pretty good record. Let me add as a postscript. If the Congress sends down some more budget-busting bills, I will veto them again and again and again."", 'But finally I want to finish my most important job--restoration of trust in the Presidency itself.

Americans have always wanted life to be better for our children than it was for each and every one of us, because life for us has been better than it was for our parents.', 'What do I see ahead in this great country of ours? I see a strong and confident America, secure in a strength that cannot be counted in megatons and a nation rejoicing in riches that cannot be eroded by inflation or by taxation.

You are great. I am grateful, and God bless you.', ""May I express my gratitude to the Seever family. That is great, great music. I have a very special family reason to thank the Seever family. Our third son, Steve, is trying to become a rodeo rider, a bronco buster, whatever you call them. [Laughter] He is just a beginner. He won't like me to classify his skill in that way, but a few months ago he got a Seever saddle. He has been doing a lot better ever since."", ""I flew out here yesterday morning to spend 4 days campaigning, meeting people on the west coast, and my very first stop was right here in the great State of Oregon.

This is God's country."", 'Some States have mountain ranges; some border on the ocean; some have fertile and productive lands, broad forests, sparkling rivers. In some you can ski, in others you can swim. But here in Oregon, you got it all.', 'My message to all of you in this beautiful spot here today in Pendleton can be summed up in a very few words. As much as I believe in a strong and prosperous American automobile industry, I have come here to say that this year is absolutely no reason whatsoever to trade in your reliable Ford for a flashier model.', 'Let me tell you why I am asking you, my fellow Americans, for your support. I have done a good job under the toughest kinds of circumstances, and I would appreciate your wholehearted support. We have achieved and maintained the peace, moved America on the road to prosperity, and we have restored the confidence and trust in the Presidency of the United States.', 'I ask you for a mandate here in Oregon--and the American people--to finish that job in the next 4 years.', 'Peace, prosperity, and trust are my record of performance since I became your President. It is a record achieved against almost insurmountable obstacles. Consider where we were in the very first few months of my Presidency. You will recall vividly, as I can, some well-known economists, some labor and political leaders who were predicting that we were heading into a deep depression, that unemployment would exceed 10 percent and that we would have all kinds of troubles for the next months and the next years.', 'They alleged that only massive Federal spending by the Government in Washington could avert a catastrophe. Inflation had soared at an annual rate of over 12 percent. Interest rates were going out of the roof. Far too many Americans were being laid off, and too few could find new jobs.', 'Just about a year ago, we hit the bottom of our worst recession in 40 years. Many were urging me to push the panic button.', 'The Congress--the economy was bothering them as it was bothering me. The economic downturn set off a clamor in the House, as well as in the Senate, for huge emergency Federal subsidies and for more and more and more and bigger and bigger Federal programs, which inevitably would have added significantly to our deficit and contributed even greater to the inflation that we were suffering.', ""The prophets of gloom were wrong. Because I had the faith in the American economy and faith in the American people, I knew they were wrong. We didn't panic. We didn't lose our cool. I never lost sight of a deeply held belief that I have, that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have."", 'In those difficult months we resisted big spending schemes that would have caused larger and larger Federal deficits and even far more destructive inflation. We rejected the discredited techniques of all politics, of tax and tax, spend and spend, elect and elect.', ""Instead, we pursued a calm, constructive, effective policy to ensure America's economic health, not just for an election year but for the long, long pull; for us, yes, but more importantly, for the young people that I see in this great arena here today. And that is what America is all about."", 'We had that deep-seated faith of the American system, that private enterprise would regain its strength. And, as a result, we meet here today not in the gloom of a recession or a depression, but in the full surge of an economic recovery.', 'One very major contributor to the strong economic recovery we are experiencing is the success, the tremendous contribution and success of American agriculture. And the State of Oregon has played a very major role in that progress and that success. And as I flew from Portland here, it was one of the most enjoyable, one of the greatest experiences to see your fields, your equipment, and to see what all of you do to make America the productive and successful economy that we have. And we thank you very, very much.', 'Admittedly, we have a long way to go in certain areas--beef production--we have to do better, and we will. But I say that overall farm exports are being traded at a record volume; farm income is at an all-time high. We have reached a major agreement with the Soviet Union which will ensure for the period of the next 5 years, a minimum of 6 million metric tons--a new market, a good market--and Oregon will contribute very significantly, tremendously in that regard.', ""Last year, talking about exports, we exported the crops of the farmers of America to the extent of $22 billion, and in 1976 we are going to export more and more of the bounty of America's agriculture. And your contribution is tremendous."", ""To make sure that good Oregon wheat and other farm products are produced for future generations and by those generations, I have proposed legislation raising the estate tax exemption from $60,000 to $150,000. But I have added to that, a stretch-out of estate tax payments at low interest rates over a 25-year period. But even more importantly, in the proposal that I have made to the Congress, the transfer of assets between husband and wife will be tax free. That will not only help the family farms of Oregon but family businesses as well. There is no reason that these wonderful family enterprises should be sacrificed just to pay the tax collector. And if I have my way, it will be yours and not the tax collector's."", ""These family enterprises have helped us turn our economy around in the right direction for the past 21 months. America's new prosperity cuts across every segment of our economy. 87,400,000 Americans are gainfully employed, they are on the job today--an all-time record, and we should be proud of it."", 'We will create more jobs by following your local example in generating new jobs in the private sector where five out of six jobs in America today exist and are available.', ""Inflation has been cut by more than half during the past 21 months, and we will keep the pressure on so that we won't have that kind of inflation threatening our economy in the future."", 'And let me point this out, if I might: on August of 1974, inflation was 12 percent; for the first 4 months of 1976 the annual rate of inflation is 3 percent or less. That is a 75-percent reduction, and we should be proud of that record, also.', 'I vetoed 49 bills that Congress sent me, and 42 of those bills have been sustained, saving the taxpayers of America $13 billion. That is progress, and for the benefit of the families, that is about $200 per family in America. And if the Congress keeps on sending to me the big spending, budget-busting bills, I will use my veto again and again and again.', 'It is about time you got to spend your money the way you want to spend it, instead of letting the Congress spend it for you. I am determined that your tax dollars work as hard for you as you work for them. I want the Government to spend less and tax less.', 'Last year, we reduced Federal income taxes. That was sound public policy. This year, I proposed another $10 billion tax cut to begin July 1, which would raise the personal exemption from $750 per individual to $1,000 per person. That is what we want.', 'Right now, it looks like the Congress would rather spend that $10 billion and almost $8 billion more, rather than let you keep it so that you could decide for yourself how that money should be spent. But let me assure you I will fight the Congress every step of the way to get your tax relief that you deserve. It will be good for America, as well as for you individually.', 'I deeply appreciate this wonderful opportunity to come before you today and talk about the programs that have returned peace, increasing prosperity and trust to America. Today, America is at peace. There are no American boys fighting anywhere on the face of the world, and I intend to keep it that way.', 'Our military strength remains unsurpassed. We have the best-equipped, the best-trained, the best-led fighting force in the world, and they are all volunteers. Your sons and your husbands are not being drafted under the Ford administration.', 'I will maintain the peace as I have achieved it. I will secure that peace through strength and through perseverance and leave that legacy of peace for our children and for their children.', 'I will continue my policies of cutting your taxes, expanding the economy, reducing bureaucracy and useless regulation, and restraining Federal spending. My policies have brought us from the depths of a recession to a sustained economic recovery and will ensure that runaway inflation never robs us or our loved ones of the rewards of honest work and lifetime savings.', 'Finally, I will finish my most important job--restoration of trust in the Presidency itself. As your President, I will promise you no more than I can deliver and deliver everything that I promise.', 'I need your support to ensure peace, increasing prosperity, and trust for the future. The future belongs to those who come after us. Americans have always wanted life to be better for the children than it was for us, because life for us has been better than it was for our parents.', 'What do I see ahead for this wonderful country, the United States of America? I see a strong and confident America, secure in a strength that cannot alone be counted in megatons and a nation rejoicing in riches that cannot be eroded by inflation or by taxation.', 'I see an America where life is valued for its quality as well as for its comfort, where the individual is inviolate in his constitutional rights, where the government serves and the people rule.', 'Thank you very, very much.']"

I could have used these rules and orders in the House of Representatives for the 25 years that I had the privilege and honor of serving there. I think these rules might be quite helpful if I sent it up to Capitol Hill right now.

Mission Viejo is an exceptional community. What a great high school marching band, and the drill team is awfully good, too, and I hope to hear the Diablos again in Washington next month.', ""Being a swimmer myself, I'm impressed by the number of championship swimmers that Mission Viejo produces. And I'm gambling that you will prove it again in the Olympic trials this summer."", 'As one of the new towns in the United States, Mission Viejo stands out because of your tremendous community being built entirely with private funds. And I congratulate Phil and all of the others who have had a part in doing this without the aid and assistance--with the initiative of all of you in this tremendous location in this wonderful atmosphere. I enjoy the opportunity of being with you this afternoon.', 'During the 10 years that you have grown, I understand you have handled your own problems with your own money, and boy, you can be proud of that. What you have accomplished here is what I have been trying to do with the Federal Government. You have been a little more successful than I have. [Laughter] But what we have been trying to do is keep the government from interfering with the free enterprise system and allowing people to do what they want to do with their own lives.', ""A little more than a year ago our economy was in the worst recession in 40 years. Unemployment was climbing, inflation was running at a rate of better than 12 percent per year. The prophets of doom and gloom were arguing that the only way to solve the problem was massive Federal spending programs. They said that would save us. I didn't agree, and I don't agree today."", ""I opposed more and more, bigger and bigger Federal spending programs. I am sure they would have created more deficits, and I am certain they would have added to our inflationary pressures. And we didn't want that under any circumstances."", 'Because we kept the lid on spending, because we had great faith in the free enterprise system, we have reduced the annual rate of inflation in the last 22 months by over 50 percent. We have increased national employment by 3,300,000 jobs in the last 12 months. We have broken the back of the recession. We are on the road to rising prosperity, renewed trust, and lasting peace.', ""Our government should spend less and tax less at the Federal level, and that's what I'm trying to do for us. Last year we reduced Federal income taxes, and I have proposed an additional tax cut of $10 billion to take effect on July 1. This proposal would increase the personal exemption from $750 per person to $1,000 per person. That would achieve some equity in the Federal tax system."", ""But in order to do that, let's be honest and frank. We have to keep a tight control on governmental spending, a balanced budget. If we do that, we can have more tax reductions by 1979. And I want to make sure in the process that we make your tax dollars work as hard for you as you did for them."", 'There is no reason that the Federal Government should continue to grow. The larger it gets, the more distance between it and between the citizen that it is supposed to serve.', 'Most of us work hard for our living. Most of you have worked from early youth, and your children are beginning to participate in the work ethic. And the financial decisions affecting you and your family should be made right here, not by some distant Federal Government.', ""I'm working to restore the local government for local people. You have a better capability, a wiser judgment to make these decisions right here in Mission Viejo than some bureaucrat on the banks of the Potomac."", 'In this Bicentennial Year, our challenge is to foster the basic appreciation we have always had for the American home, the American family, the moderation of the relationship of the government to the governed, and continued American strength throughout the world.', 'In the first century of our great country, our government was devoted to the establishment of a strong and stable and fair and equitable system of government. It was a unique experiment in self-government by the people.', 'In the second century of our country, it was a century of industrial progress in which America became the most powerful nation in the history of mankind. As we became the most productive nation, we found that our growth created the problems of bigness. In the process, the individual became dominated by huge institutions of all kinds--mass government, mass labor, mass industry, and mass education.', ""As I see the third century of our wonderful country, I see it as one in which we return responsibility to the individual, to encourage all Americans to help themselves. And as I travel around America it's easy to see most of us want a renewed. personal responsibility to each other and to the Nation as a whole as active citizenry makes a vital nation. It may sound awfully trite, but we have been letting Uncle Sam do it far, far too long. I'm for cutting out the unbearable Washington red tape, rolling up our own sleeves and doing it for ourselves."", 'Some Americans have been disillusioned and some have become skeptical, and I can understand it. But I have found, as I travel from one State to another, that the great majority of us want to make things right in America. What we want to do is best for our society and for our country. We want to live up to that great heritage that our ancestors gave us, as a free and independent country and free and independent people. In response to that desire I want to devote my efforts to confidence and trust in our institutions, a task that must succeed if we are to rebuild our faith in the future for our children, our grandchildren and the country that we love so much.', ""We've made a good start. We will work together, you and I. What I promise you I will deliver. In return, I need your help, your simple strength, discipline, maturity, truth."", 'Let me say this in conclusion: Certain things are temporary; some things are permanent. In 200 years our beliefs have not changed in America. This is still a country where the government serves and the people rule. Thank you very, very much.']"

Ford ,"May 24, 1976","['Thank you very, very much Ev, Congressman Chuck Wiggins, Sheriff Larry Gillich, members and guests of the California Peace Officers Association:', 'I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to be introduced by my good friend, Evelle Younger, and I am delighted to have an opportunity to be in the congressional district so ably represented by my long and very good friend, Chuck Wiggins.', ""It's also a great privilege and honor for me to address this convention of the Peace Officers of California. Your daily struggle to keep the peace and combat crime in this State has won the well-deserved praise of the people of California."", 'I am delighted to add my words of support and gratitude for the great success and the fine efforts by each and every one of you. In a special sense, the goals of your service and mine are precisely the same--to make life secure for our fellow citizens.', 'As President for the last 21 months, I have been working at home and abroad to lay down a solid, secure foundation for America as our Nation enters its third century. That will be a century for individual freedom and achievement and self-fulfillment. I see it as a century in which Americans will build on all of the great accomplishments of our first 200 years. But to do that, Americans must be secure in their homes and in their streets and in their jobs and in a peaceful world. It must be a century of security for all Americans wherever they live, they work, or wherever they play.', 'Consider the very real concern of so many Americans about the problems of crime. Let us start with the great Preamble of our Constitution, which seeks to ""insure domestic Tranquility..."" Law makes human society possible. It pledges safety to every member so that the company of fellow human beings can be a blessing instead of a threat.', 'Do we provide that domestic tranquility which the Constitution seeks? If we take the crime rates as an indication, the answer has to be ""No."" Violent crimes on our streets and in our homes make fear pervasive. They strike at the roots of our community life. They make citizens fear one another.', 'The time has come for society to act in its own self-defense. As a first important step, I strongly favor the use of the death penalty in the Federal criminal system in accordance with proper constitutional standards. The death penalty, in certain circumstances, should be imposed upon the conviction of sabotage, murder, espionage, and treason, and I think most Americans support that approach.', 'In murders involving substantial danger to the national security or when the defendant is a cold-blooded, hired killer, the use of capital punishment is fully justified.', 'The harsh fact is that passivity and permissiveness invite crime and that the certainty of punishment prevents crime--I mean positive, swift, and just punishment.', 'We all recognize the criminal justice system need not be vindictive to be effective. As President, I will give no comfort to those who make false allegations of police brutality. I will not excuse the real brutality that exists in America today-the brutality of hoodlums in the streets of our cities throughout the United States.', 'Millions and millions of our citizens, including the elderly and the poor, lock themselves in their homes, fearing violence. I would, instead, lock up the criminals who make them afraid. A legal system that is exploited by the criminal but ignores his victim is sadly out of balance. I ask your help and that of all Americans in restoring that balance.', 'The great majority of crimes constitute violations of State laws and, therefore, under our Constitution, the responsibility for dealing with them rests primarily on local officials. The Federal Government, however, can serve as a model by firmly and justly enforcing its own laws and by improving the quality of the Federal criminal justice system.', 'We recall in this Bicentennial Year, that our Founding Fathers adhered to the dictum of John Locke: ""Where there is no law, there is no freedom."" The overwhelming majority of Americans are law-abiding citizens. It is a hard core of law-breakers who commit a very large proportion of all crime.', 'A recent study in one major metropolitan area recently showed that within 1 single year more than 200 burglaries, 60 rapes, and 14 murders were committed by only 10 individuals.', 'A great many serious crimes are committed by repeaters. You know that probably better than I. Such criminals--duly tried and convicted--must be removed from our society for a very definite and specific time. A law-abiding majority in America has its rights, and those rights should be given full weight on the scales of justice in America.', 'With very few exceptions, I strongly advocate mandatory minimum sentences for individuals who commit crimes or offenses involving the use of a dangerous weapon or who commit such grave offenses as aircraft hijacking, kidnaping, and dealing in hard drugs, and for repeated offenders who commit Federal crimes that harm or endanger others.', 'The way to reduce criminal use of handguns is not to disarm law-abiding citizens. I am totally opposed to the registration of guns or gunowners. The way to reduce criminal use of handguns is to impose mandatory sentences for gun crimes, to prohibit the manufacture and sale of Saturday night specials, and to concentrate our resources for enforcement in high crime areas.', 'Last July, I recommended to the Congress, as my good friend Chuck Wiggins knows, a bill to achieve these objectives, and I urge and strongly advocate action by the Congress to act immediately and without harassing the lawful gun owner.', 'Another important cause of the violent crime that plagues Americans and makes a major contributor to the soaring crime rate is drug abuse. The time has come to step up our fight, sharpen the weapons in our arsenal, and launch a new and a far more aggressive attack against this insidious enemy. The cost of drug abuse to this Nation is absolutely staggering.', 'Every year, more than 5,000 Americans die from direct drug-related causes. Every year, more than 170,000 injuries can be directly traced to drugs. Every year, the problem of drug abuse adds up to costs of something like $17 billion.', ""Significantly, the greatest bulk of this $17 billion is money lost through crime. Law enforcement officials estimate that up to one-half of the robberies, muggings, burglaries, and other forms of property crimes are committed by addicts to support their expensive and debilitating habit. It's a real tragedy. And I pledge to you today that I will spare no effort to crush the menace of drug abuse."", 'Clearly, as we look at the picture today, our first defense must be directed at our own borders to clamp down on the illegal flow of drugs from foreign sources. Since today, 80 to 90 percent of the current flow of heroin comes across the Mexican border, we must expand our crackdown in that area, and we will.', 'I will not recite the added activity that the Federal Government is undertaking in this area, but I can assure each and every one of you that it is being directed right from the White House.', 'Our efforts, however, must not stop there. We must accelerate our law enforcement efforts throughout our own country.', 'Despite all the rhetoric of recent years, I do not believe that we have yet succeeded in making it tough enough for drug traffickers. The people who traffic in hard drugs are nothing less than merchants of death and should be put-and I mean put--behind bars for a long, long, long time.', 'Justice Department studies show that more than a quarter of those convicted of narcotics trafficking do not spend a single day in jail. The extraordinary laxity that sometimes exists was illustrated recently in a case when law enforcement officers arrested 31 people, most of whom were major violators responsible for a very large shipment of heroin into the United States. Nineteen of those arrested were immediately freed on a $500 personal recognizant bond, even though their offenses were punishable by 15 years in jail.', 'All but 2 of the 19 had long, long arrest records, and 1 was on parole for a narcotics offense. This is unforgivable and completely indefensible. We have to close legal loopholes that permit traffickers to escape the Federal penitentiary. Those who live off the misery of others must pay the price, and the higher the price, the better, as this President sees it.', 'Above all, we must always remember that law enforcement alone cannot win the war on crime. The combined efforts of the Federal Government, State and local authorities will be of little use unless the American people rally to fight the scourge of crime within their own communities.', ""I am particularly encouraged by the citizens coalitions against crime that are cropping up all over the United States. Here, as in other law enforcement areas, California is in the forefront. The 50,000 volunteers in the neighborhood watch program in the city of Los Angeles have been able to cut crime substantially. In Vallejo, not a single member of the city's home alert program had their homes burglarized during all of 1975."", 'Americans have always stood united. Americans have always stood strong against all enemies. Crime and drug abuse are enemies that we can overcome, but there must be a very deep, personal, and a deep national dedication to that goal.', 'If I had to sum up the record of my administration in just a few words, it would be peace, prosperity, and trust in America.', 'Today, America is at peace. Your sons are not being drafted, and they are not dying on any battlefield. I want to maintain the peace, advance the peace among all nations, secure the peace through strength and perseverance, and leave that legacy of peace for our children and their children.', 'I will continue my policies of the last 21 months of cutting your taxes, expanding the private economy, reducing bureaucracy and useless regulation, and restraining Federal spending. These policies have brought us from the depths of a recession to a sustained recovery and will insure that runaway inflation never robs us again or our loved ones of the honest work and their lifetime savings.', 'I want to pursue a steady course that led from war to peace, from recession to recovery, from cynicism to confidence, from fear to faith. Finally, I want to finish the most important job--restoration of trust in the Presidency itself.', ""As your President, I will promise no more than I can deliver, and I will deliver everything that I promise. The reason that I am in this race--and I'm in it to stay--is to ensure peace, prosperity, and trust for the future of the 215 million Americans."", 'The future belongs to those of us who come after you and myself and our fellow Americans. We Americans have always known that life will be better for our children than it was for us, because life for us has been better than it was for our parents and our grandparents.', 'What do I see ahead for this wonderful country? I see a strong and confident America, secure in a strength that cannot alone be counted in megatons, and a nation rejoicing in riches that cannot be eroded by inflation or by taxation.', 'I see an America where life is valued for its quality as well as its comfort, where the individual is inviolate in his constitutional rights, where the government serves and the people rule.', 'Thank you very much.']"

There are no American boys fighting anywhere in the world, and I intend to keep it that way. To make sure that our military strength remains unsurpassed in the future, I proposed the two largest military budgets in the history of the United States. But between 1964 and 1974, the Congress cut $50 billion out of military budgets submitted by two previous Presidents and reduced the share of national security funds to the lowest in the history of the United States since the end of World War II.', ""During my administration, we are reversing the trend. We're going to make sure that we do the right thing for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Marines, because you and I depend upon them for our security, for the maintenance of peace and the deterrence of aggression. We are proud of these young men, these leaders in our military forces, and I look around here and see them-gee, America owes them a great deal, and I thank each and every one of you for it."", ""I'm delighted to see Paul Priolo here, a great leader in your State legislature, and Bob Wilkinson, a great representative of local government. Believe me, it is a pleasure to work with them and to have their help and support."", 'But I am here primarily to ask for a solid mandate from you so that I can finish the job and make America truly secure for future generations. I will maintain the peace. I will secure the peace through strength and perseverance and leave the legacy of peace for our children and their children. I will continue my policies of cutting your taxes, expanding the private economy, reducing bureaucracy and useless regulation, restraining Federal spending.', 'These policies have brought us from the. depth of a recession to a sustained recovery and will ensure that runaway inflation never robs you or our loved ones of the rewards of honest work and lifetime savings.', 'Finally, I will finish the job in the 4 years--the restoration of trust and confidence in the Presidency itself. As your President, I will promise no more than I can deliver, and I will deliver everything that I promise.', 'Americans have always wanted a life better for our children than it was for each of us, because life has always been better for us than it was for our parents.', 'I will tell you what I see ahead for the great country that we live in. I see a strong and confident America, secure in a strength that cannot alone be counted in megatons, a nation rejoicing in its blessings that cannot be eroded by inflation or by taxation.

Like America, that advice is about 200 years old, but it\'s still pretty good advice in 1976.', ""First, let me compliment all of you on the phenomenal progress your industry has made over the years. You have grown from some 75 shopping centers in 1949 to more than 16,000 in 1976. You've shared in America's rising postwar prosperity, and you have filled a very major need for America's growing suburban population."", ""Twenty-one months ago, America's prosperity and economic strength were threatened by a chilling combination of recession and inflation. Some of America's leading economists and politicians thought it best to impose wage and price controls to deal with America's economic problems. Others insisted that we spend massive amounts of Federal dollars to stimulate the economy, despite the serious danger of feeding an already tragic inflation."", ""I decided that the way to real recovery and enduring prosperity in America was not through government quick fixes. It has never worked, and it won't work. I had faith that America would work its way out of its economic difficulties, rather than trying to spend its way out."", 'I proposed and the Congress accepted a major tax cut for individuals and tax incentives for business expansion and job production so that we could get the great free enterprise system in America working at full speed again. We also began a comprehensive effort to restore the confidence of the American people, a confidence in themselves, in their government, in their future. This effort was absolutely essential to restoring economic confidence of the consumer, a very key element in our economic recovery.', 'I think the record shows that these policies have been very successful. America today is in the midst of a strong and surging economic recovery, and I compliment the American people for their wisdom, their forthrightness, and their success.', ""The real gross national product rose during the first quarter of this year at an annual rate of 8.5 percent--far, far above the most optimistic predictions of a few months ago, in dollars and cents. That means the value of America's output of goods and services rose at an annual rate of almost $200 billion, and even here in Las Vegas, that's not a bad jackpot. [Laughter]"", 'The amount of money people have to spend after taxes and other deductions are taken from their paychecks, what the economists call real spendable income, has increased by $100 billion in the past year.

Food sales are up more than 7 percent. General merchandise is up 12 percent. The prime rate of interest has been reduced from 12 percent, when I became President, to 6 3/4 percent today.', 'Since the bottom of the recession, almost exactly a year ago, we have gained 3,300,000 more jobs and more than 710,000 more jobs in the last month alone. But the most encouraging statistic is more Americans--87,400,000--are on the job today, more than ever before in the history of the United States.', ""Considering where we started about 12 months ago when the unemployment rate was nearly 9 percent, I think that's a very good comeback by any standard.

Just over a week ago, I proposed to the Congress a very broad and comprehensive 4-year agenda for action in reform in every major segment of our economy as far as the Federal Government is concerned. This would include, for example, EPA, OSHA, plus all of the other more or less traditional regulatory agencies."", ""This, if the Congress will cooperate, will give to us an opportunity to say that unless the Congress acts on what we propose in regulatory reform--if they don't act in 9 months--what the President recommends will become the law of the land. And this is the only way that I know, from the 25 years of being a part of and dealing with the Congress, that we can get them to move in the right direction. And I ask for your help."", ""My administration has also undertaken some of the most fundamental reforms of Government regulations and reporting requirements in this country's history. I was amazed. In the past, small business in America spent $18 billion every year just to comply with Government reporting requirements. Most of the merchants in American shopping centers are small business men and women, and it's time that they got back to working for their customers instead of working for the Government. To put it another way, it's time the Government minded its own business for a while and let you run yours."", ""More government will not solve America's economic problems. The answer is less government control, less wasteful government spending, and lower taxes for middle-income Americans."", 'I have proposed to the Congress that we cut Federal income taxes by $10 billion on July 1 of this year and, particularly, to increase the personal exemption from $750 per person to $1,000 per person. My proposal also calls for the enactment of a special accelerated depreciation allowance for new plants and new equipment to make permanent the increase in the investment tax credit and to retain the $50,000 corporate surcharge exemption.', ""I want the American people to keep more of the money that they have worked so hard to earn. I want them to spend it the way they want to spend it--at the shopping center, for their children's education, for whatever they need, instead of paying more and more for government programs that we don't need."", 'As some of you may know from my struggles with the Congress, I have vetoed 49 bills sent to me by the House and the Senate over the last 21 months.

Consider for a moment where we were in the first months of my Presidency. Inflation had soared to an annual rate of over 12 percent. Far too many Americans were being laid off and could not find new jobs.', 'Just about a year ago, we hit the bottom of our worst recession in 40 years. Many were urging that the President push the panic button. In Congress, many were calling for huge emergency Federal subsidies for more and bigger Government programs and higher deficit Government spending.', ""We didn't panic; we kept our cool. We never lost sight of a belief that I have had all of my political life: A government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have."", ""We resisted big Government spending programs that would have inevitably caused larger deficits and even more destructive inflation. We did not go along with the discredited techniques of old politics: tax and tax, spend and spend, elect and elect. Instead, we pursued a calm, constructive, conservative point of view to insure America's economic health not just for an election year, but for the long pull."", 'I had faith in you, 215 million Americans from the East to the West, from the North to the South. I had faith that the American system of private enterprise would once again gain its strength that has made us the envy of the world.', 'Today, we meet not in the gloom of a depression or recession, but in the full surge of an economic recovery. We have added almost 3,300,000 more jobs since the bottom of the recession 12 months ago, and 700,000 more jobs in the last month.

That's a good record."", 'Now, let me add a little postscript. If that Congress keeps on sending down some of these budget-busting, inflationary proposals in the future, I will use that veto again and again and again for the American benefit of all of you.', ""You know, it's about time that you get an opportunity to spend your money the way you want to spend it, instead of letting the Congress spend it for you. I am deeply determined that your tax dollars work as hard as you as each and every one of you have worked for them. I want the Government to spend less and to tax less."", 'Last year, we reduced Federal income taxes. This year, I propose that beginning July 1 of this year that we have another $10 billion tax reduction--75 percent of it to go to the individual taxpayer so that you can spend your money the way you want it, and 25 percent to go to industry so they can expand, so they can modernize and provide more jobs for people all over this country.', ""As far as individual income tax reductions are concerned, I want the personal income tax exemption increased from $750 per person to $1,000 per person. Middle-income taxpayers in this country deserve a fair shake, and they haven't gotten it in the last 10 years."", 'Let me make it absolutely certain and positive, I will fight this Congress every step of the way to get the kind of tax relief that the American people deserve.', ""But as we strengthen America's economic security, we must, of course, increase America's national security.

I want to increase the personal exemption from $750 per person to $1,000 per person. I want to enact an accelerated depreciation allowance and another investment tax credit to retain the $50,000 corporate surtax exemption.', 'Let me change the subject, if I might. I have vetoed 49 bills sent to me by the Congress over the last 21 months. Responsible Members of the Congress sustained 42 of those vetoes and, incidentally, those vetoes have saved the American taxpayers $13 billion. If the Congress keeps on sending me big spending, budgetbusting expenditure bills, I will use my veto again and again and again. And that is in the best interest of this country.', 'If the Congress would act responsibly--and that is pretty hard for a majority of them, not Al or Pete, of course--if they would enact my tax cut proposals instead of thinking up new ways to spend your money, we could create in this country a tremendous demand for goods and services that would mean many, many more American jobs and lasting prosperity. That would be the inevitable result.', ""One of the most encouraging economic statistics is the index of consumer confidence. 'That's all of us, 215 million of us in this great country. Well, it's going up double what it was a year ago. In economic terms, that means, of course, the American people are spending more money, moving more goods, and even willing to borrow again for major purposes for the future. It means the American people are looking to the future with faith instead of fear. I have restored that faith by making my administration an open, candid, and forthright one, and I will promise no more than I can deliver and I will deliver everything that I promise."", ""As we came from the airport to this wonderful facility, I had an opportunity to talk with Mayor Hayes. She discussed with me the absolute need and necessity for Congress moving on the extension of general revenue sharing. Now, that term or title doesn't necessarily mean a great deal to all of you, but let me be quite specific. Back in 1972 it was decided that we ought to give to the 39,000 local units of government, including San Jose and the 50 States, about $5 to $6 billion a year so that the local people would make the decisions as to how that money would be spent instead of having some far-off bureaucrat in Washington telling you what you in San Jose ought to have or shouldn't have."", ""Well, that program has been a tremendous success, and I have talked to Mayor Hayes about it. I led the fight for that legislation in 1972. A year ago, I asked the Congress to extend that legislation for another 5 3/4 years. It's almost unbelievable that the Congress hasn't acted upon that legislation."", 'I know that my two former colleagues here in this auditorium today agree with me. But, if that legislation is not enacted soon, it means that the States-50 of them, and the local units of government, 39,000 including your great community of San Jose--will either have to increase taxes or reduce services.', ""I urge you in every way that you can to stimulate the Congress to move on this legislation. I am proud of the fact that I fought for it, and I am fighting for it now, and I don't understand those other Presidential candidates who don't think it is a good idea. It's good for San Jose, it's good for California, and it's good for America."", 'I was also told on the way in that there were some wonderful senior citizens in this audience here, and I would like to talk to them quite specifically, as well as talk to some of the people who are about to retire. For too long a time there has been a disposition on the part of the Congress to duck the problem that we face as to the financial integrity of the Social Security Trust Fund.', ""When I looked at the figures last November and December it was obvious to me that we had to face up to the fact that in a 12-month period, right now, there will be a $3.5 billion deficit between revenues on the one hand and expenditures and benefits on the other. And if we don't act affirmatively and face up to the hard issue, it means that next year there will be a $4 billion deficit and the following year it will be over $4 billion. This trust fund could soon come down to zero."", ""I think every public official in this country owes an obligation to our older citizens because they have earned what they get from the Social Security Trust Fund, and we won't let you down. Those politicians who duck the issue I think are not playing fair and square with the 33 million Americans who are today receiving benefits and the millions and millions of other Americans who are paying and expect their government to live up to its obligation."", 'As long as I am President, we are going to find a way to keep our commitment to those under social security. I assure you of that. As I finish, let me ask each and every one of you, that I hope and trust that the record I have carried out for the last 22 months would justify your support. We have returned peace to America. We have the capability militarily and diplomatically to ensure that peace. We have turned our economy around, and we are on the upswing of a surging prosperity. Everything that is supposed to be going up is going up and everything that is supposed to be going down is going down.', 'Finally, I think I have restored trust in the White House and the Oval Office. I want to pursue a steady, constructive course that has led us from war to peace, from recession to recovery, from cynicism to confidence, and from fear to faith. With your support, with your mandate for the next 4 years, I will continue to work for an America where life is valued for its quality as well as for its comfort, where the individual is inviolate in his constitutional rights, and where the government serves and the people rule.', 'Thank you very, very much.']"
75,Gerald R. Ford ,"May 25, 1976","['Thank you very much John Nejedly, Mayor Schroder, Marguerite Weisheimer, Les Saywell, fellow Americans:', ""It's wonderful to be here in Rossmoor. It's just superb weather, obviously wonderful people, that would be enough to make a person smile."", ""But just before coming out here, I got some other good news. We got some reports from the great States of Kentucky and Tennessee. They're having a primary election today, as you may know. One of six--CBS has just projected that President Ford is going to win in Kentucky by about 7 points, and all the indications are that we will do just about as well in Tennessee. So, if I'm smiling, I apologize, but I just can't help but think those are darn good victories."", ""I understand that I'm the first President of the United States ever to have the honor and privilege of speaking here in Rossmoor. And now that I have seen so much of the facilities and heard so much about what a great place this is from Dean Lesher,1 gee, I think I will go back and tell First Mama that this isn't a bad place to come. [Laughter]"", 'Well, my message today can be summed up very simply. As much as I believe in a strong and prosperous American automobile industry, let me say that this year is absolutely not the year for you to turn in or trade in a reliable Ford for a flashier model. [Laughter]', 'My staff gave me a speech that they thought might be appropriate to the circumstances. And after hearing so much about Rossmoor, I have decided to sort of put it in my pocket and proceed to talk about some of the things that I think all of you here might be interested in, and do it right from the cuff because I can do it with conviction; I can do it with deep feeling.', 'All of you, I am sure, if you will refresh your memory, can go back to that month of August in 1974 when this country faced a serious transition, when we were faced with three very important problems as a country, 215 million of us.', 'The country had gone through a traumatic period--there was a tremendous loss of confidence and trust in the highest places in our country. We were suffering some of the most serious economic problems that this country had faced in a long, long time. We had gone through an oil embargo and tremendous increases in the price of oil forced upon us by countries beyond our shores.', ""Inflation was rampant at the rate of 12 percent or higher; we were on the brink of the worst economic conditions in the last 40 years. And as I look around this audience, many of you can remember, as I do, the 1930's, and those weren't very pleasant times."", 'So, we had a real difficult situation to handle. We were confronted with a deterioration--unemployment was going up and employment was plummeting. At the same time during that month of August and the few weeks that followed, our allies abroad, whether they were in the Atlantic or across the seas in the Pacific, were uncertain as to the resolution and as to the will, whether our form of government facing this kind of a crisis could recover and could meet the challenge that was needed and necessary if we were to maintain our leadership throughout the world.', ""At the same time, our adversaries, whether in the East or in the West, were in the position where they didn't know quite how to react, whether to take an initiative that would be against our interests or to wait and see."", ""So, when I took that oath of office it wasn't a situation that was most pleasant. It presented great difficulties and great obstacles. But I decided at that time that the decisions I would make in the months to follow would be decisions that would not be related to politics but would be decisions predicated on what in my heart and conscience I thought was in the best interest of this country."", ""The net result is in the last 21 or 22 months we have made those decisions. They haven't always been popular among some people, but when we add up all of those decisions whether it was in promoting certain taxation proposals or in vetoing a good many of the measures that were sent down to the Oval Office by the Congress, in each and every case I could say that I thought I did what was right for America."", 'Let me just take one or two examples to illustrate what I am saying. As the economic problems began to multiply in early 1975 and all the prophets of gloom were saying we were going to have unemployment of over 10 percent, that we had to rush in with big spending proposals to put everybody on the Federal payroll, it was my feeling that a better approach would be to give a shot in the arm to our private enterprise system, to give tax relief to business so it could expand and could modernize, increase production.', 'I thought it was a far wiser policy to give tax relief to individuals rather than to add to the deficit by more Federal spending, and the net result was in 1975 we had a tax decrease, both for business as well as for individuals. And the net result was that the private enterprise system, that great, great segment of our society, responded.', 'Where are we today? Well, inflation, instead of being at 12 percent or higher, as it was in August of 1974, it is now, for the first 4 months of 1976, at 3 percent or less, and the net result is that we have cut the rate of inflation by 75 percent, and I am very proud of that achievement.', 'At the same time, we have been trying to stimulate the economy so that in the private sector, where five out of the six jobs in America exist anyhow, it could absorb those losses that we had in early 1975.', ""The confidence of the American people returned because we didn't panic, we didn't capitulate, and the consequence is that in the last 12 months, since we were at the bottom of the depth of that recession, we have added 3,300,000 more jobs--700,000 more jobs in the last month. And as of last month, 87,400,000 Americans are on the job--an all-time record of employment in this great country, and we should be proud of it."", ""As I said, it wasn't easy to deal with the Congress. Fortunately, I know a little bit about how they operate it and how they should operate and how they shouldn't operate. So, when they started sending all these big spending bills down to the White House, I warned them, I said don't do it. We're going to veto them. So, they sent them down and we vetoed 49 of those bills; 42 of them have been sustained by the responsible Members of the Congress. And the net result is the taxpayers of this country have saved $13 billion, and we ought to be proud of that, too."", ""I am glad to see that one of my old colleagues in the House of Representatives, Al Bell, is here. He's a good friend, and he served well in his responsibilities in the Congress. Al, it's nice to see you here."", 'But let me add that if they send down--and I have told these old friends of mine, Democrats and Republicans, the only way you can prevail with them is to talk straight and to let them know if they do this, this is going to happen-I said, fellows, you send down any more of those big budget-busting spending bills, I will veto them again and again and again. I think they have learned their lesson.', ""But let's talk about taxes for a minute. I recommended in January of this year that if we would reduce the rate of growth of Federal spending by 50 percent--which amounts in dollars to $28 billion--we could have another tax decrease for both industry on the one hand and individuals on the other as of July 1. We are going to fight for that kind of a tax decrease."", 'What does it do? Lets talk about individuals first. It would increase the personal exemptions from $750 per person to $1,000 per person, so the middle income people, who have been shortchanged, will get a fair and decent break in our tax system.', ""But then there's another tax proposal that I think might be of interest to you that was included in this package. One, our estate tax laws have not been revised since the mid-1930's. At that time, the exemption was set in estate tax laws at $60,000, and the husband and wife transfers were treated just like a transfer between an individual and a stranger. So, I have recommended to the Congress that they increase the exemption under our estate tax laws from $60,000 to $150,000. But something that I think is even more equitable, under the proposal that I have recommended, the transfers between husband and wife would have no tax as far as the Federal Government is concerned."", 'We have got to provide equity and fairness in our Federal tax system, and I can assure you that this Congress knows that. I mean business and we will do the very best we can in the months ahead during this session to achieve a tax system that is right and proper. But if we are unsuccessful in 1976, I pledge to you that in the next 4 years we will get the kind of a tax bill that we need and the country needs and our people need.', ""Let me talk just a minute or two about peace. We achieved it, we have it, and we have the military capability to maintain it, and we have the diplomatic skill in order to keep our friends, our friends and our adversaries at arm's length."", 'I could describe to you what I have recommended to the Congress for military appropriations, but let me just summarize. Last year, in January, I recommended the largest military budget in the history of the United States in order to reverse the trend, the trend that had resulted in 10 years of Congress, in effect, gutting the Army, the Navy, Air Force, and Marines.', ""Do you realize that in that decade the Congress cut military appropriations by $50 billion? I wasn't going to stand for it, and I said last year to the Congress, give me a budget so we can have the capability with the Army, the Navy, the Marines, and the Air Force to defend America, to deter aggression, and to protect our national security."", 'I think we are making the headway this year, because they recognize that what I have proposed is right--to maintain the unsurpassed military capability of the United States.', ""But now let me conclude with just one other comment. I said in August of 1974 we were going through a traumatic experience; confidence had been lost. The Ford administration has been open, it's been candid, it's been forthright. I will never promise more than I can deliver, and I will deliver everything that I promise."", 'Yes, what do I see as we go down the years ahead for the next 4 years, but more importantly, what do I see in America in the next century? I think America ought to be a country of individualism. We have the greatest form of government in the history of mankind. We are the most productive nation in the history of the world.', 'But I want your help and assistance to sustain a program that has brought us from the depths of the recession to sustained recovery that will ensure that runaway inflation never robs us again--our loved ones--and will reward those who work hard and have saved during their lifetime.', 'Finally, I want to finish my most important job, as I said, the restoration of trust in the Presidency of the United States. I will promise to maintain that respect and decency that is so important for our Nation. I need your support to ensure peace, prosperity, and trust for the future--the good, secure, satisfying future that we owe to our children as well as our grandchildren. Americans have always wanted a better life for our children than what it was for ourselves, because life for us had been better than it was for our parents.', 'What do I see ahead for this great country? A strong, a confident America, secure in a strength that cannot alone be counted in megatons, a nation rejoicing in its blessings that cannot be eroded by inflation or by taxation. I see an America where life is valued for its quality as well as its comfort, where the individual is inviolate in his constitutional rights, where the government serves and the people rule.', 'Thank you very, very kindly.']"

We were in the depths of a recession, the worst in 40 years. But what we did was not lose our cool.

And the net result is that in the last 12 months, we have increased the number of employees, people on jobs, by 3,300,000--last month, an increase of 710,000.

When I became President 21 months ago, the rate of inflation was 12 percent or higher. In the last 21 months we have reduced the rate of inflation by 75 percent. For the first 4 months of this year, 1976, the rate of inflation on an annual basis is 3 percent or less. Any time you can cut inflation by 75 percent, we must be doing something right, and I think we have."", ""Now, let's talk about our national security.

And I have been so impressed with the program as a whole."", ""When I get back to Washington, we're going to take a real good look to see if we can't, on a national scale, implement something comparable to this. We have to, of course, see what the law says, what the money is, but the concept is good and we're going to do our best to expand it beyond the borders of the State of Ohio."", 'For more than 40 years, through the vehicle of social security and other programs, the Federal Government has made a firm commitment of support for older citizens of our society. I pledge to you that I will continue without hesitation, reservation, to uphold that commitment.', ""In recent years there has been some very dramatic progress to meet the needs of America's older generation. I want to do better and, with your help and with the help of a responsible Congress, I will, and we will. And this is something that all of us owe to this great generation of Americans, those at the present and those that are to follow. And as President of the United States, I will do everything possible in my power to help our Nation demonstrate its deep, deep concern for the dignity, for the well-being of our older generations."", 'The social security program, the largest of its kind in the world, will pay almost $83 billion to more than 32 million Americans in this next fiscal year. This is more--and I emphasize more--than a $10 billion increase over the current year. And, of course, I suspect many of you know--but I want to reemphasize it to show my commitment--in my budget for the next fiscal year, which begins October 1, 1976, I am recommending that the full cost-of-living increase in social security benefits be paid in that year.', ""As you also know, however, there are problems facing our social security system. Next year, unless my reforms are adopted, the Social Security Trust Fund will run a deficit of nearly $3½ billion. In the next 12 months after that, if we don't follow a responsible course as I have proposed, the deficit will be $4 billion in a 12-month period."", ""But let me assure you very emphatically, my administration intends to preserve the integrity and the solvency of the social security system for your benefit and that of all working Americans now as well as in the future. As long as I am President, we're going to keep our social security protection and every other retirement program strong, sound, and certain."", 'In addition to the social security program, we are continuing our commitment to benefit programs for more than 3 million railroad, military, and Federal Government employees.', 'After many, many years of sacrifice and hard work, these Americans have contributed much to our great Nation. They have earned our respect as well as our admiration. They have earned more than the prospect of poverty in their retirement years.', 'In my budget, the Supplemental Security Income program, or SSI, will pay almost $6 billion in Federal benefits to more than 5 million disabled and disadvantaged older Americans in 1977--140,000 of them right here in the great State of Ohio.', 'In the field of health care, the Federal Medicare program, in 1976, will provide more than $17 billion for the health care of 24 million older and disabled Americans, 1,200,000 again right here in the great State of Ohio.', 'Now, there are some flaws in this program which actually help raise the cost of your medical care and which fail, unfortunately, to provide or to protect you adequately against the economic burdens of a prolonged illness. I have proposed major improvements in the Medicare program to make it serve you better. One of the most important improvements would provide for the payment of all but a very small fraction of the catastrophic costs of complex or extended care as well as treatment.', ""I don't have to tell you that medical treatment is very, very expensive today. If you have to stay in a hospital or a nursing home or under doctor's care for a very long, long time, it puts an incredible strain on your lifetime savings or on your peace of mind, and that strain is felt by your loved ones just as well as yourself. All of us know cases--a friend, a neighbor, a part of your family--in which someone has been stricken with an illness that lingers on and on and on. We know of the pain; we know of the heartache associated with a prolonged and expensive illness. We know that being sick and bedridden for an extended period of time is bad enough without having a person's income and life savings dwindling as the medical bills keep piling up."", ""This must not continue, and I, as President, will not permit it to continue. And, therefore, I recommended what I think is a good program to solve the problem. There is no reason that older Americans should have to go broke just to get well or stay well in the United States of America. Under my proposal the individual's contribution to Medicare would go up very slightly, but consider what the increase would provide to you and to the other 24 million who would be covered. Nobody eligible for Medicare would have to pay more than $500 per year for hospital or nursing home care or more than $250 a year for a physician's services. Medicare would pay the rest, whether it is $1,000, $10,000, or $50,000."", ""That's good protection, and I think it's a good program, and I hope you will support it. This proposal provides the full protection so vitally needed by older Americans and, if the Congress passes it, the ruinous economic burden of catastrophic illness is one thing America's older citizens will never have to worry about again."", 'Another of my programs would consolidate 16 Federal health programs, including Medicare [Medicaid], into a single $10 billion bloc grant program to the States. If we can consolidate these programs, we can make them far more humane and far more effective.', 'We can improve the services that they provide to you and millions like you, and we can get those services to more people who really need them. Programs of this kind, despite some abuses, do a tremendous amount of good. They provide food services and health care for many of our older citizens. For some of our elderly neighbors, they provide the means for life itself.', 'I know it is all too easy to say that the Federal Government is to big, that this program and that program ought to be cut out of the Federal budget, tossed back to the States to cope with it if their taxpayers will permit it.', ""Jim Rhodes knows and I think most of you know it is not that simple. I know it, and anyone who has thought it out knows it very, very well. The programs-if I can put it this way--the problems and the challenges discussed at this conference will center on the needs of Ohio's older citizens. They are often very, very special needs."", ""But the elderly of our Nation are also vitally affected by the problems and concerns that face all of the 215 million Americans. Perhaps the greatest of these are the problems of inflation. During 1974, August 9 to be precise, when I became President, inflation was ranging at an annual rate of 12 percent or higher, eating away at everybody's buying power, but absolutely devouring the livelihood of people on fixed incomes."", 'Americans living on fixed incomes could see their purchasing power eroding with each visit to the supermarket. I knew that something had to be done to bring the situation under control as quickly and as effectively as possible. I knew that deficit spending by the Federal Government was a major contributor to inflation, that slowing the growth of Federal spending was essential to solve the problem. In short, I believe our Government should spend less and our Government should tax less.', ""I am proud to say to each and every one of you, I'm proud of the sound and steady policies of my administration that have succeeded. In the last 4 months-from January through the month of April--the rate of inflation on an annual basis is less than 3 percent, and that's a 75-percent reduction from what it was when I became President."", 'It is a victory for all Americans because inflation is no respecter of age. The old as well as the young suffer. What I want--and I think all of us want, young or old, black or white, rich or poor--is to live in dignity, to live in security, and to live in peace.', 'If we continue making the progress America has made in the last 12 months, we will see that goal achieved. If I had to sum up the record of my administration in just a very few words, it would be peace, prosperity, and trust.', 'Today America is at peace. There are no American boys fighting anywhere on the face of the Earth, and I intend to keep it that way.', 'I will continue my policies of cutting your taxes, expanding the private economy, reducing bureaucracy and useless regulation, and restraining Federal spending. My policies have brought us from the depths of a recession to a sustained recovery and will ensure that runaway inflation never again robs us or our loved ones of the rewards of honest work and lifetime savings.', 'Finally, I want to finish the most important job--the restoration of trust in the Presidency itself. As your President I will promise no more than I can deliver, and I will deliver everything that I promise.', 'I need your support to ensure peace, prosperity, and trust for the future--the good, secure, fulfilling future that we owe to our children and to our grandchildren. Americans have always wanted life to be better for our children than what it was for us, because life for us has been better than it was for our parents.', 'Now, what do I see for this great country of ours in the future?

I want to express my deepest appreciation to Congresswoman Millicent Fenwick and Congressman Ed Forsythe and Congressman Mat Rinaldo, who are here with me. We had earlier at the airport Senator Cliff Case. And it is wonderful to be in Paterson, first to go to the Great Falls and the tremendous crowd and, secondly, to come to the Kramer home and to see so many darn good Republicans, some fine Independents, and some super Democrats.', 'Before making a few remarks, let me make this observation. Most of you know I come from the great State of Michigan. Most of you know that anybody coming from Michigan ought to be interested in a healthy and prosperous automobile industry. But as much as I want the automobile industry to have a prosperous year in 1976, this is not the year to trade in a reliable Ford for a flashier model. [Laughter]', 'On Tuesday, we bare the last of 30-some primaries. I am the only Republican candidate for the Presidency who has entered every primary. And why did I do that? Because I want the opportunity for as many voters in this country to have an opportunity to make a choice. I am entered in the New Jersey primary because I want the people of the Garden State to have a chance to vote for President Jerry Ford.', ""It's my understanding that my opponent did not venture into the great State of New Jersey with his name on the ballot. I want you to know that we have to make a massive effort between now and Tuesday in this State to make sure, yes, that I get a good vote, to be certain and absolutely positive that the Ford delegates get elected in every one of your congressional districts."", ""You know I have been in politics a few years, and I know that sometimes people get a little lackadaisical. They get a little apathetic when the challenge is not there. We can't afford that in the State of New Jersey on Tuesday. We have to make a massive effort; we have to get a tremendous vote, and that means that every county leader, that means that every voter in this State, gets not only himself or herself to the polls but makes absolutely positive that everybody who can vote goes to the polls and sends out a strong, strong message that the State of New Jersey is in President Ford's column."", 'Let me give you a few reasons why I think we ought to have 4 more years of this administration.', 'Number one, when I became President 22 months ago-let your minds drift back--this country was in a very serious situation. The American people, for reasons we all know, had lost their confidence in the White House. The American people knew that we were suffering serious economic problems with the rate of inflation of over 12 percent. The American people knew we were on the brink of a serious economic recession. The American people knew that their friends and allies around the world were uncertain as to the will and the resolution of this great country. Our adversaries were in a mood that they might well have taken advantage of the circumstances in America.', 'It was not a very happy time to become President of the United States, but we decided that we would work at the job; we would have solid, sound programs and policies to turn things around.', 'I believe that because of the frankness, the straightforwardness, the candor, we have restored the confidence of the American people in the White House and in the Oval Office. And we will do it for the next 4 years.', 'We have turned the economy around. A year ago unemployment was going up, and employment was going down. But because we had a good program, we followed a calm, constructive approach to what the problems were economically.', 'Today--it was announced just Friday by the Department of Labor--the United States has 87,700,000 people gainfully employed, the most Americans who have ever had jobs in the history of the United States. That is a good record. We had 300,000 more jobs in the month of May. We have 3,600,000 more jobs in the last 12 months.', ""Let's take just a look at inflation--12 percent when I became President, 3 percent or less for the first 4 months of this calendar year. We made a 75 percent reduction in the rate of the inflation, and that is a good record that we ought to be proud of."", ""I remind you in the area of foreign policy, there isn't a single American boy fighting and dying on any foreign soil under the Ford administration. We have the kind of military strength that can meet every mission and every challenge, and we have the diplomatic skill to make sure that in the next 4 years we will keep the peace through strength under this administration."", 'I might say, parenthetically, the Ford administration has no intention whatsoever--there is no reason for it--to commit U.S. troops to southern Africa.', ""So, when you sum it all up, I think we've got a good record, a record that can make the American people proud from going to adversity to strength and from strength to increased prosperity, a restoration of confidence and trust in the White House, and an economy that will give a job to everybody who wants a job. That's the program; that's what we are going to do."", 'Now, let me make one final observation. As I travel around the country, and I have visited a good many States, I am positive that President Jerry Ford can be elected President in November. And I am absolutely certain that I can do a better job than any other Republican candidate for the Presidency to make sure that Ed Forsythe and Millicent Fenwick and Pat Rinaldo and some other good Republicans are elected to the Congress in 1976.', ""Let me make a firm personal commitment. First, I don't promise anything I can't produce, and I produce everything I promise. And furthermore, Betty and Jerry Ford won't let you down in the next 4 years."", 'Thank you very, very much.']"

And I want to congratulate them.', 'Let me just speak for a few moments about peace, prosperity, and trust. When I became President of the United States 22 months ago, in August of 1974, this country was in a serious situation.', 'The American people, for reasons that we all know, had lost their confidence and trust in the White House. One of the first jobs that I had to do was to restore that confidence. And I decided at that time, the only way that a President could do that was to be open, to be frank, to be forthright, to be candid. In the last 22 months, your President has stood for those things; we have had an open administration. And the net result is the American people trust their President and have confidence in the White House.', ""Twenty-two months ago we were suffering with inflation of 12 percent or higher. Your earnings were being eroded. Your taxes were too high. We were on the brink of a serious recession, the worst one in 40 years. But what have we done? We've turned it around. We have done it the right way. We have reduced inflation from 12 percent or higher to 3 percent or lower. That's a 75-percent reduction in the rate of inflation. That's a darn good record."", ""A year ago unemployment was going up, employment was going down. We have turned it around. Right now, we have 87,700,000 people gainfully employed-the most jobs in the history of the United States. And that is a darn good record. Incidentally, we have added 3,600,000 jobs in the last 12 months, 300,000 jobs in the last month. But, I am not satisfied. I won't be satisfied until we get a job for everybody who wants a job and will look for a job."", 'Twenty-two months ago our Federal taxes were too high. In 1975 we cut Federal taxes a total of some $23 billion--75 percent of it going to individuals and 25 percent of it going to business.', ""When I submitted the budget for this coming fiscal year, in January of this year, I decided that Federal spending was too high, and I recommended a 50-percent cut in the growth of Federal spending. And we're going to do better than that. And if the irresponsible Members of the Congress--none of these people sitting up here--send me some budget-busting, deficit-spending bills, I will veto them again and again and again."", ""But in January of this year, I decided we ought to have another tax cut. That's the way to give all of you an opportunity to spend your money, instead of having the bureaucrats in Washington spend it. So, I recommended a $10 billion tax cut to begin July 1, which would include the increase of your personal exemptions from $750 per person to $1,000 per person. So, get the Congress to do it."", ""Now, let's talk about peace. When I became President, we were still at war some 8,000 miles away. That war has been ended. We have achieved the peace. We have the military capability, we have the diplomatic skill to keep the peace. And I can assure you that this administration, because we're strong, because we are skillful, because the American people have the will and the resolution, we're going to keep the peace in the future, period."", ""I might .remind you, there is not an American boy fighting on foreign soil and dying today. Thank goodness for that. I might add, there isn't a single young man out of the 2,100,000 who was drafted. They're all volunteers. And nobody getting through high school or college is under the eye of the draft, and the Ford administration will keep it that way in the future."", ""But let's take just a minute--that election tomorrow is a vitally important one. It will probably decide who's going to be the Republican nominee for the Presidency. Let me ask you a question: Do you want a Republican candidate for the Presidency who can win, or do you want one who's going to lose? I say, vote for Ford. You have a candidate who will win."", ""Let me ask you one other question about that election tomorrow. We can't have the right kind of Government in Washington, we can't have the right kind of government in your great State of Ohio, unless we have more Republicans in the State legislatures, unless we have more Republicans in the Congress. You want a candidate at the head of the ticket in the national election for November that can help Bob Taft get reelected--that is vitally important--that will help Tenny Guyer, that will help Bud Brown, that will help us get more candidates elected, so the Republican President can have a working majority to get the job done, to cut spending, to reduce taxes, to keep the peace, and to keep the confidence and trust that the American people demand of their Government in the Nation's Capital."", 'Let me just conclude with this: You know, those of us who come from Michigan, we love you Buckeyes, we love Woody Hayes1--[laughter]--and I love him particularly because he came out and endorsed me.

The American people had gone through a difficult time. There had been a great loss of trust and confidence in the White House itself. The United States was going through an economic disaster. Inflation was over 12 percent. Unemployment was beginning to rise. Employment was going down. Taxes were too high. Our allies abroad were uncertain as to what the United States would do, whether the American people and this government had the will and the resolution to meet the challenges. Our adversaries around the world were wondering whether they should be tempted to take advantage of this unfortunate situation.', 'I became President in probably as difficult a time as any President ever assumed that great office. We started out first recognizing that we had to achieve peace, we had to turn the economy around, and we had to restore trust and confidence in the White House itself. So, right from the very first day, your President decided he would be open, he would be candid, he would be forthright, he would be straightforward with the American people. Your President decided he would not promise anything more than he could produce and he would produce everything that he promised, and he has.', 'Then we had the problem of inflation, growing unemployment, fewer jobs, and we decided that we had to take a firm, steady course to correct the problem.', ""What's happened? In the last 12 months we've added 3,600,000 more jobs, 700,000 of them in the month of April, 300,000 more in the month of May. Last Friday, the Department of Labor announced that we had 87,700,000 people gainfully employed in this country--the highest number in the history of America. That is a good record. But it's not good enough. I'm not going to be satisfied until we get over 90 million people gainfully employed in the United States. And President Ford won't be satisfied until everybody who wants a job, who's looking for a job, gets a job in the United States of America."", 'I said a moment ago that Federal taxes were too high. So, last year I recommended to the Congress--and the Congress approved--a $23 billion tax reduction, 25 percent of it to go to business so they can modernize, so they can upgrade their capability, and 75 percent of it went to the individual taxpayers of this country. And that helped to take us out of the recession.', 'At the same time, I said the Federal Government was spending much too much money, so in January of this year I recommended to the Congress that we cut the growth of Federal spending by 50 percent, and I said we needed another tax cut on July 1 of this year which would include an increase in the personal exemption from $750 per person to $1,000 per person. That is what the Congress has got to do for you.', ""But then we ought to make some other adjustments in Federal taxes. As I was driving up here from Lima, I saw the beautiful farmlands on each side of the interstate highway. Those are family farms and, as I drove in here to Findlay, I saw some of what are obviously family-owned businesses. What we want to do is to protect the family farm. We want to make certain that family businesses don't go to the Federal Government."", 'So, I recommended to the Congress a few months ago two things to take care of that problem. Number one, we would increase the estate tax exemption so that the owner of a farm could pass it on to the next generation, so the owner of a business could pass it on more easily to the next generation. And I recommended also that a transfer of property from husband to wife would be tax free. I think that is right.', 'And now, speaking about agriculture, you know the American farmer has produced under our administration the greatest corn crop, the greatest wheat crop, the greatest soybean crop in American agriculture--once we got the Federal agents off your back and out of your hair, you could produce.', 'And let me say very specifically, under the Ford administration we will never let the American farmer and what he produces be a pawn in the foreign policy decisions of this Government.', ""But let's take the last--peace. When I became President, we were still engaged in that conflict some 8,000 miles away. It is over and, because we are strong, because we have the diplomatic skill to do the job, we are ,at peace, and we are going to stay at peace because our allies respect us and our adversaries also respect us. And let me point out, as Tenny Guyer did, your great Congressman, there isn't an American boy fighting on a foreign soil and dying on a foreign soil under this administration."", ""Now, let's talk about tomorrow. You've got a big decision to make. If you want to nominate a Republican candidate for the Presidency who can win in November, if you do, vote for President Ford. If you want a candidate on the Republican ticket who can help to reelect Bob Taft, who can help to reelect Tenny Guyer, who can help to reelect Del Latta and all of the other Republicans and add to the number of Republicans in the House of Representatives, in the Senate, if you want a Republican at the head of the ticket who will help Jim Rhodes get some more State legislators, if you want a Republican at the head of the ticket that can help get Republicans elected in the courthouse, you go out there tomorrow and vote for President Ford and his delegates.

And this administration will keep the peace in the future because we have the resolve, the military capability, and the skill to do so. I commit myself to that. And let me add, I think it is important for all of you to remember that there is not a single American boy today fighting or dying on any foreign battlefield. That's the record of the Ford administration. And I might say parenthetically, the Ford administration is not going to commit any U.S. military personnel to Rhodesia or South Africa."", 'But now let me make this comment: Tomorrow you may well be making the decision who will be the Republican nominee for President of the United States. If you want a Republican candidate to win, you should vote for Jerry Ford. He can win in 1976. And if you want a candidate at the top of the ticket to help elect Bob Taft--which is important--a candidate who will help to elect Bud Brown and the rest of the State legislative and local ticket, you vote tomorrow for Jerry Ford, who has done a good job. I want your vote. I appreciate your help.', 'Thanks for being here.']"

It has been wonderful to be here all morning and to see so many of my old friends."", 'Quite a few years ago I had the privilege of living for approximately 6 years in the State of Connecticut, where I worked and learned, and as a result I have tremendous admiration and affection for the people of Connecticut. And I thank you for this very, very warm welcome.', 'The long series of primaries and State conventions come to a conclusion today, here in Connecticut and across the continent to Utah. This healthy and vigorous competition has taught us much about the mood of the American people in 1976.', 'Here in Connecticut, as in all 50 States, there is a growing feeling of confidence in the future. The American people feel good about themselves and about their country. The Bicentennial celebration reached its climax 2 weeks ago and revealed a spirit of harmony, good will and optimism about America which had been eclipsed during the turmoil of the last decade and a half.', 'It comes as no surprise to me for all our past troubles we have emerged as a stronger and wiser people. The American people, the descendents of the hardiest stock of many, many nations, have a deep reservoir of strength which has served the Nation well for the past 200 years and will serve us well in the future as we move forward for the betterment of our country and for mankind as a whole.', 'That powerful American spirit brought us through the worst economic crisis America has faced in 40 years. Two years ago inflation was running at a rate of more than 12 percent. Thousands of men and women were being laid off. A climate of fear threatened to engulf our people. What has happened since August of 1974?', 'Inflation has been cut in half. Since the bottom of the recession last year, 3,400,000 of our fellow Americans have found new jobs or gotten their old jobs back, and more people are being added to payrolls each and every day. More people have been on the job in America in 1976 than ever in the history of this great country. We have broken the back of the recession. Everything that is supposed to be going up is going up, and everything that should be going down is going down.', ""We are in the full surge of a strong recovery. We look with confidence to an era of enduring prosperity without the cruel tax of runaway inflation. That's a good record. I am proud of it, but there is more good news."", ""Two years ago America was mired in what seemed like an endless war in Southeast Asia. After a decade in which the Congress had consistently shortchanged America's defenses, the future of our military strength was in danger. In August of 1974, America's will to respond to international challenges was being called into question by allies and adversaries alike. What has happened since August of 1974?"", 'Today, America is at peace. There are no American boys fighting anywhere on the face of the Earth, and I will keep it that way.', 'I have proposed the two largest defense budgets in history, reversing the trend of the last decade in order to ensure that our military capability commands the respect of every nation. A strong military capability is the best insurance for peace, and we are going to keep that Defense Department ready, able, and effective in order to maintain the peace in the future. This is 2 years of progress despite a Democratic Congress that fought us every step of the way.', ""Two years ago the people's confidence in their Government, especially in the White House, had been shattered. What has happened since August of 1974?"", 'The Ford administration has been open, candid, forthright. In my administration, ability is not enough; experience is not enough; dedication is not enough. In all that we do, in everything we undertake, I require integrity, decency, and honesty. Private morality and public service can and must go hand in hand.', 'In the past 2 years we have passed from war to peace, from recession to recovery, from tragedy to trust, from fear to faith in America. This is performance, not promise. This is a record that will be supported by the American people--Democrats, Independents, and Republicans. It will lead us to victory in 1976.', 'What about the future? What challenges will be demand of ourselves as we enter the third century of this great American adventure?', 'First of all, we must create a better balance in our society. We must introduce a new balance in the relationship between the individual and the government, a balance that favors a greater individual freedom and self-reliance. We can achieve this better balance by my tax proposals in several areas that will create greater equity and fairness in our Internal Revenue Code. For example, we must increase the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000 per person. We must increase the estate tax exemption from $60,000 to $150,000. Our middle-income taxpayers need a better break. They have been shortchanged in the past.', 'We must strike a new balance in our system of federalism, a balance that favors greater responsibility and freedom of action for the leaders of our State and local units of government. We must introduce a new balance between spending on domestic programs and spending on defense, a balance that ensures we will fully meet our obligations and our compassion for the needy while also protecting our security in a world hostile to freedom.', ""In all that we do, we must be honest with the American people, promising them no more than we can deliver and delivering all that we promise. Above all, we must face the future together as a party and as a people. It is as true today as it was in Lincoln's day that a house divided against itself cannot stand. For our party, that means joining ranks in a common struggle."", 'The Republican Party this year has demonstrated throughout America the vigor, vitality, and competitive spirit on which a dynamic political organization thrives. Now we must resolve to stop fighting each other and start helping each other. We must resolve to strengthen our party with November victories at every level--from the courthouse, to the statehouse, to the Congress, and to the White House. We must center our attack not on fellow Republicans, but on the failures of the Democratic Congress, on the Democratic platform, and a Democratic ticket which tries to be all things to all people.', 'For our country, the new unity we have found must be channeled into commonsense action for the common good, but the common good in this country must always be reflected in the well-being of the individual. Every American must have the chance to reach his or her full potential, unfettered by excessive bureaucratic regulation, by the injustices of discrimination, or by the conforming pressures from the giant institutions in our society.', 'Americans are ready once more for an era of good feeling, not in the blind belief that all our problems are solved, but in the certain conviction that we can solve these problems together.', 'We can ensure that older Americans will have nothing to fear from the ravages of runaway inflation, from the flaws in the social security system, from the threat of crime, or from the costly burdens of catastrophic illness.', 'We can ensure that the American farmer will continue to produce record crops of food and fiber and get a fair price in a free worldwide market and ensure at the same time that the American consumer will have ample supplies and stable prices.', 'We can ensure that every working man and woman in America who wants a job can find a job--not a Humphrey-Hawkins dead-end job, but a well-paying job with a future generated by an expanding free enterprise economy. We can ensure that our young people have an education of high quality and a job worthy of their talents.', 'We can ensure that government will again be the capable servant, not the meddling master of the American people. We can ensure that the American people will continue to live in peace, to continue to live in freedom by keeping America strong and by standing for what is right throughout the world.', 'We can achieve these great goals without looking to the Federal Government for all the answers and without sticking the American taxpayer with all the bills. We can do it all and still balance the Federal budget. With the right kind of a Congress, with a few more outstanding Members of the House and Senate like Lowell Weicker, Ron Sarasin, and Stu McKinney, I promise you that by fiscal year 1979 we will do just that.', 'These are not dim visions of the future. They are the proud record of my administration over the past 2 years, with the help of your delegation from the State of Connecticut and Lowell and Ron and Stu. Let me thank you for having them at my side, and believe me, we sure need them back.', 'But this record of progress over the last 2 years will be the agenda for my administration in the next 4 years. These are my goals. This is my pledge--to lead this Nation forward on the path of peace, prosperity, and trust. Join me, if you will, on the road to a great victory for the Republican Party and for the United States of America in 1976.', 'Thank you very much.']"

When we first talked, Elly, we discussed, as you indicated, if we could get 50,000 women actively involved on behalf of President Ford and Betty, we would be doing very well. This is a magnificent effort on your part and a tremendous expression of the power of women in a political campaign. I am sure it has had a tremendous impact on the preconvention. I am absolutely certain it will be a significant contributor to our victory in November, and I thank you and I thank them."", ""But in addition, I would like to express Betty's and my deep appreciation for all of the people who have worked here in whatever capacity.

We have done a good job. But everytime the going got rougher and rougher, everytime we had a hard, tough decision to make-and we did--I had the feeling that the young people in this country understood the problems and were on our side.', 'But let me, if I might, take just a minute. Your parents, your grandparents, have made a great effort over their lifetime to make this a good country. But they wanted to make it a good country for one single reason--because they wanted their children and their grandchildren to have a better America for themselves than they did for themselves. That is what you want for your children, and that is why you are so idealistic, that is why you have a cause, that is why you are here--because you believe in something, something good about America.', 'You want peace at home, and you want peace throughout the world. I am on your side. In the last 2 years we have healed America at home. And in the last 2 years we have achieved peace abroad, and we are going to keep it abroad.', 'Our Nation is trusted, respected.

They want it better--more parks, a better life for when they go on vacation, a better life when they live in their urban centers or on their farm. They want an environment that will make this country the kind of a country where we can have a quality of life, not today, not tomorrow, but during this next century. I am on your side.', 'The American people, especially our youth, want to help the economy with jobs. I am on your side.

The only criteria that I use is that every American-white and black, old and young--who wants a job has a job.', ""Our country has grown from 13 poor, struggling colonies with less than 3 million people 200 years ago. For the first 100 years of our Nation's history, we developed the greatest form of government in the history of mankind. And then, in the second century of America's history, we were the leaders in developing an industrial revolution that made it possible for us to lead the world in worldly goods."", 'But it is my feeling that in our third century--and I think this came through during that wonderful Fourth of July celebration--we have to make the third century of America the century of the individual, so that he lives--we have to have the opportunity for that individual, wherever he or she may live, a century where we have peace abroad and peace at home; where we have the environment where a quality of life is meaningful to each and every one of us; where a job is not just a government-promised job, but a job with some real commonsense, with an opportunity for advancement and permanency; a third century where you and your children and your grandchildren can have a vision for a broadened opportunity for each and every one of you every day of every year. We have to have that vision of a better America.', ""Our forefathers gave us much--a good government, the opportunity to increase our worldly goods--but if we don't keep and strengthen the opportunity for individual liberty, all of which we believe in won't have much meaning, And so I say to you, Jerry Ford is on your side.

He served with great distinction not only in the House but in the Senate of the United States, representing the great State of Kansas. Bob Dole, of course, had an outstanding record in the military service in World War II. Bob Dole has been a team player. Bob Dole's philosophy and mine coincide almost identically.

We saw again the pioneer vision of our revolutionary founders and our immigrant ancestors. Their vision was of free men and free women enjoying limited government and unlimited opportunity. The mandate I want in 1976 is to make this vision a reality, but it will take the voices and the votes of many more Americans who are not Republicans to make that mandate binding and my mission possible.', 'I have been called an unelected President, an accidental President. We may even hear that again from the other party, despite the fact that I was welcomed and endorsed by an overwhelming majority of their elected representatives in the Congress who certified my fitness to our highest office. Having become Vice President and President without expecting or seeking either, I have a special feeling toward these high offices. To me, the Presidency and the Vice-Presidency were not prizes to be won, but a duty to be done.', 'So, tonight it is not the power and the glamour of the Presidency that leads me to ask for another 4 years; it is something every hard-working American will understand--the challenge of a job well begun, but far from finished.', 'Two years ago, on August 9, 1974, I placed my hand on the Bible, which Betty held, and took the same constitutional oath that was administered to George Washington. I had faith in our people, in our institutions, and in myself. ""My fellow Americans,"" I said, ""our long national nightmare is over.""', 'It was an hour in our history that troubled our minds and tore at our hearts. Anger and hatred had risen to dangerous levels, dividing friends and families. The polarization of our political order had aroused unworthy passions of reprisal and revenge. Our governmental system was closer to stalemate than at any time since Abraham Lincoln took the same oath of office. Our economy was in the throes of runaway inflation, taking us headlong into the worst recession since Franklin D. Roosevelt took the same oath.', 'On that dark day I told my fellow countrymen, ""I am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your President by your ballots, so I ask you to confirm me as your President with your prayers.""', 'On a marble fireplace in the White House is carved a prayer which John Adams wrote. It concludes, ""May none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof."" Since I have resided in that historic house, I have tried to live by that prayer. I faced many tough problems. I probably made some mistakes, but on balance, America and Americans have made an incredible comeback since August 1974. Nobody can honestly say otherwise. And the plain truth is that the great progress we have made at home and abroad was in spite of the majority who run the Congress of the United States.', 'For 2 years I have stood for all the people against a vote-hungry, free-spending congressional majority on Capitol Hill. Fifty-five times I vetoed extravagant and unwise legislation; 45 times I made those vetoes stick. Those vetoes have saved American taxpayers billions and billions of dollars. I am against the big tax spender and for the little taxpayer.', ""I called for a permanent tax cut, coupled with spending reductions, to stimulate the economy and relieve hard-pressed, middle-income taxpayers. Your personal exemption must be raised from $750 to $1,000. The other party's platform talks about tax reform, but there is one big problem--their own Congress won't act."", ""I called for reasonable constitutional restrictions on court-ordered busing of schoolchildren, but the other party's platform concedes that busing should be a last resort. But there is the same problem--their own Congress won't act."", ""I called for a major overhaul of criminal laws to crack down on crime and illegal drugs. The other party's platform deplores America's $90 billion cost of crime. There is the problem again--their own Congress won't act."", ""The other party's platform talks about a strong defense. Now, here is the other side of the problem--their own Congress did act. They slashed $50 billion from our national defense needs in the last 10 years.My friends, Washington is not the problem; their Congress is the problem. You know, the President of the United States is not a magician who can wave a wand or sign a paper that will instantly end a war, cure a recession, or make bureaucracy disappear. A President has immense powers under the Constitution, but all of them ultimately come from the American people and their mandate to him. That is why, tonight, I turn to the American people and ask not only for your prayers but also for your strength and your support, for your voice, and for your vote."", 'I come before you with a 2-year record of performance without your mandate. I offer you a 4-year pledge of greater performance with your mandate. As Governor Al Smith used to say, ""Let\'s look at the record.""', 'Two years ago inflation was 12 percent. Sales were off. Plants were shut down. Thousands were being laid off every week. Fear of the future was throttling down our economy and threatening millions of families.', ""Let's look at the record since August 1974. Inflation has been cut in half. Payrolls are up. Profits are up. Production is up. Purchases are up. Since the recession was turned around, almost 4 million of our fellow Americans have found new jobs or got their old jobs back. This year more men and women have jobs than ever before in the history of the United States. Confidence has returned, and we are in the full surge of sound recovery to steady prosperity."", 'Two years ago America was mired in withdrawal from Southeast Asia. A decade of Congresses had shortchanged our global defenses and threatened our strategic posture. Mounting tension between Israel and the Arab nations made another war seem inevitable. The whole world watched and wondered where America was going. Did we in our domestic turmoil have the will, the stamina, and the unity to stand up for freedom?', 'Look at the record since August, 2 years ago. Today America is at peace and seeks peace for all nations. Not a single American is at war anywhere on the face of this Earth tonight.Our ties with Western Europe and Japan, economic as well as military, were never stronger. Our relations with Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and mainland China are firm, vigilant, and forward looking. Policies I have initiated offer sound progress for the peoples of the Pacific, Africa, and Latin America. Israel and Egypt, both trusting the United States, have taken an historic step that promises an eventual just settlement for the whole Middle East.', ""The world now respects America's policy of peace through strength. The United States is again the confident leader of the free world. Nobody questions our dedication to peace, but nobody doubts our willingness to use our strength when our vital interests are at stake, and we will. I called for an up-to-date, powerful Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines that will keep America secure for decades. A strong military posture is always the best insurance for peace. But America's strength has never rested on arms alone. It is rooted in our mutual commitment of our citizens and leaders in the highest standards of ethics and morality and in the spiritual renewal which our Nation is undergoing right now."", ""Two years ago people's confidence in their highest officials, to whom they had overwhelmingly entrusted power, had twice been shattered. Losing faith in the word of their elected leaders, Americans lost some of their own faith in themselves."", ""Again, let's look at the record since August 1974. From the start my administration has been open, candid, forthright. While my entire public and private life was under searching examination for the Vice-Presidency, I reaffirmed my lifelong conviction that truth is the glue that holds government together--not only government but civilization itself. I have demanded honesty, decency, and personal integrity from everybody in the executive branch of the Government. The House and Senate have the same duty."", ""The American people will not accept a double standard in the United States Congress. Those who make our laws today must not debase the reputation of our great legislative bodies that have given us such giants as Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, Sam Rayburn, and Robert A. Taft. Whether in the Nation's Capital, the State capital, or city hall, private morality and public trust must go together."", 'From August of 1974 to August of 1976, the record shows steady progress upward toward prosperity, peace, and public trust. My record is one of progress, not platitudes. My record is one of specifics, not smiles. My record is one of performance, not promises. It is a record I am proud to run on. It is a record the American people--Democrats, Independents, and Republicans alike--will support on November 2.', 'For the next 4 years I pledge to you that I will hold to the steady course we have begun. But I have no intention of standing on the record alone.', 'We will continue winning the fight against inflation. We will go on reducing the dead weight and impudence of bureaucracy. We will submit a balanced budget by 1978.', ""We will improve the quality of life at work, at play, and in our homes and in our neighborhoods. We will not abandon our cities. We will encourage urban programs which assure safety in the streets, create healthy environments, and restore neighborhood pride. We will return control of our children's education to parents and local school authorities."", 'We will make sure that the party of Lincoln remains the party of equal rights.We will create a tax structure that is fair for all our citizens, one that preserves the continuity of the family home, the family farm, and the family business.We will ensure the integrity of the social security system and improve Medicare so that our older citizens can enjoy the health and the happiness that they have earned. There is no reason they should have to go broke just to get well.', 'We will make sure that this rich Nation does not neglect citizens who are less fortunate, but provides for their needs with compassion and with dignity.', 'We will reduce the growth and the cost of government and allow individual breadwinners and businesses to keep more of the money that they earn.', 'We will create a climate in which our economy will provide a meaningful job for everyone who wants to work and a decent standard of life for all Americans. We will ensure that all of our young people have a better chance in life than we had, an education they can use, and a career they can be proud of.', ""We will carry out a farm policy that assures a fair market price for the farmer, encourages full production, leads to record exports, and eases the hunger within the human family. We will never use the bounty of America's farmers as a pawn in international diplomacy. There will be no embargoes."", 'We will continue our strong leadership to bring peace, justice, and economic progress where there is turmoil, especially in the Middle East. We will build a safer and saner world through patient negotiations and dependable arms agreements which reduce the danger of conflict and horror of thermonuclear war. While I am President, we will not return to a collision course that could reduce civilization to ashes.We will build an America where people feel rich in spirit as well as in worldly goods. We will build an America where people feel proud about themselves and about their country.', 'We will build on performance, not promises; experience, not expediency; real progress instead of mysterious plans to be revealed in some dim and distant future. The American people are wise, wiser than our opponents think. They know who pays for every campaign promise. They are not afraid of the truth. We will tell them the truth.', 'From start to finish, our campaign will be credible; it will be responsible. We will come out fighting, and we will win. Yes, we have all seen the polls and the pundits who say our party is dead. I have heard that before. So did Harry Truman. I will tell you what I think. The only polls that count are the polls the American people go to on November 2. And right now, I predict that the American people are going to say that night, ""Jerry, you have done a good job, keep right on doing it.""', ""As I try in my imagination to look into the homes where families are watching the end of this great convention, I can't tell which faces are Republicans, which are Democrats, and which are Independents. I cannot see their color or their creed. I see only Americans."", 'I see Americans who love their husbands, their wives, and their children. I see Americans who love their country for what it has been and what it must become. I see Americans who work hard, but who are willing to sacrifice all they have worked for to keep their children and their country free. I see Americans who in their own quiet way pray for peace among nations and peace among themselves. We do love our neighbors, and we do forgive those who have trespassed against us.', 'I see a new generation that knows what is right and knows itself, a generation determined to preserve its ideals, its environment, our Nation, and the world.', ""My fellow Americans, I like what I see. I have no fear for the future of this great country. And as we go forward together, I promise you once more what I promised before: to uphold the Constitution, to do what is right as God gives me to see the right, and to do the very best that I can for America.God helping me, I won't let you down.Thank you very much.""]"
94,Gerald R. Ford ,"August 20, 1976","['Thank you very, very much, Bob.', ""It is good to see Mayor Roger Williams coming back from Washington. He said he straightened everything out back in Washington. I don't have the same problem in Russell, Kansas. [Laughter]"", ""It's great to be here with Governor Bennett, Lieutenant Governor Smith, my very good friend, your Senator, Jim Pearson, my long-time and very good friend, Keith Sebelius. It's just nice to be here in the great State of Kansas."", ""I know that you produce a tremendous amount of wheat. I know that you're a great cattle-producing State. I know that you make a significant contribution in the production of oil energy which we need so badly. But the thing that impresses me--and I think it's worth noting--the great State of Kansas produces some great statesmen."", ""You can run down the list from Dwight D. Eisenhower to All Landon to former Senator Frank Carlson to another fine Senator, Harry Darby. And as Bob Dole, said, I have been out in this part of Kansas on a number of occasions. I was out in Great Bend a year or so ago. I went to Dodge City and survived. [Laughter] But during the time that I served in the Congress of the United States, in the House, I got to know a great, great Congressman, he was a pretty big guy, Wynn Smith. And he was followed by Bob Dole, and now Keith Sebelius. What I'm really saying is you not only produce cattle and wheat and energy but, doggone it, you produce great people."", 'When I looked over the list of people that I wanted to be my teammate in the months ahead, for the first 75 days while we go through a tough campaign so we can have the privilege and the honor of winning November 2 and serving the American people for the next 4 years--Bob Dole was the guy.', 'Let me mention just one or two reasons why Bob makes a wonderful teammate. We have to bring Washington, D.C., and local government closer together. Bob Dole was your county prosecutor, or county attorney, for 6 or 8 years. He understands the problems of local communities and their relationship with the Federal Government. We have to establish a better relationship between State government and the Government in Washington. Bob Dole served in your State legislature, so he understands the problems of the statehouse and the State legislature.', 'Bob Dole served in the House of Representatives for 8 years in Washington, D.C., representing this great western part of the State of Kansas. So he understands all of your individual problems.', 'I will bet Bob could look around this group from Russell, Kansas, mention many, many, many by name, and could refresh your memories--and his--of how he helped you to do this or helped you do that. Bob is the kind of a person who has a personal contact with people.', 'Then, of course, he has done a superb job in the United States Senate. Bob served in the House of Representatives on the Committee on Agriculture. He served in the Senate on the Committee on Agriculture as well as the Committee on Finance. Those are two very, very key committees that involve not only the people of Russell, Kansas, but 49 other States.', 'Let me just talk for a minute about the input that Bob can have and why his part on the ticket is so essential.', 'First, we have got to find a way to give greater tax relief to the middle-income people of this country who have been shortchanged over the years. About a week ago the United States Senate was considering this tax bill that has been there for consideration for some time. Bob took the initiative, on a recommendation made by me, to take some real relief for middle-income taxpayers. He offered the amendment to increase the personal exemption for every taxpayer from $750 a person to $1,000.', ""But I've been talking to Bob about another problem that involves his Committee on Finance. It is extremely important. If we want to maintain the continuity of the family farm and the small family business, we have to increase the estate tax exemption from $60,000 to at least $150,000."", 'But then Bob, in addition to his responsibilities on the Committee on Finance, has been a stalwart friend of the farmer on the Committee on Agriculture. Bob has talked to me not once, but many times about the problems that agriculture faces, and he has been one of the most ardent and effective advocates.', ""Let me summarize to all of you right out here in the heartland of agriculture, in Russell, Kansas, what I said to the American people last night. The farmers of America must get a fair price in a free market. We want an expanded production, an increase in our exports. We want to be able as a humanitarian country to help feed the people around the world, because that's our responsibility. But let me add this: This administration will never make the hard work and the production of the American farmer a pawn in international diplomacy. Then one final comment--two words: This administration will have no embargoes, period."", ""But this great country, as I said last night, offers to the young an opportunity; to the old, certainty, happiness, and security; to the businessman, to the farmer, an opportunity to move ahead as your forefathers have done. I think every person that I look at who has children or grandchildren has worked hard, has sacrificed, has done all of the things for one single reason: We want to make a better America for the children and grandchildren that will follow us. That's our tradition; that's what we're going to do."", 'It\'s great to be in Russell. When I called Bob yesterday, I said, ""Bob, I would like you to be on the team."" He thought for a moment and then he said, ""I have got to have one commitment."" I said, ""Well, don\'t hesitate too long."" [Laughter] He said, ""Will you come to Russell, Kansas, tomorrow?"" I said ""Yes.""', ""So, here we are. I can't express my appreciation and gratitude adequately. I'm looking forward to an opportunity to say hello and shaking a good many hands. We'll stick with you. We need your help to keep America going to peace, prosperity, and trust for the next 4 years."", 'Thank you very, very much.']"

And I understand, David, that you are unopposed this year in your campaign for the presidency of B'nai B'rith. David, you will have to tell me how you do it. [Laughter]"", ""I am honored to address this convention saluting both the 133d year of B'nai B'rith and the 200th anniversary of the United States. You, the sons and daughters of the Covenant, have kept your commitment to Judaism and to America."", ""As one of America's pioneer voluntary agencies, your seven candles have generated light and warmth and love. Your compassion illuminates the best of our Nation's traditional spirit of voluntary service to others. Your devotion to family virtues and values makes me proud to serve as President of the great American family of which the Jewish community is a cherished member."", ""I have been meeting with B'nai B'rith for more than a quarter of a century and always understood that you were a nonpartisan organization. I had prepared an appropriately nonpartisan speech for this morning, but when I saw the morning paper, I was disappointed to see that one of your speakers yesterday apparently kicked off our debates from this rostrum. As a matter of fact, I originally proposed that our first subject be defense and foreign policy, and that it should be held yesterday, September 8. Mr. Carter rejected this arrangement. I guess he did not want me to be present. Well, I got here as quickly as I could. [Laughter] Without objection, I'd like my turn at the plate."", 'Number one, Mr. Carter told you, ""I have called for closer ties with our traditional allies and stronger ties with the State of Israel."" I say to you, Israel is one of our traditional allies, and our ties have never been closer or stronger.', 'As for our other allies, the gentleman has proposed troop withdrawals from Western Europe and from Korea; defense budget cuts that would cripple our ability to supply or sustain our friends; bans on nuclear tests by our allies; a nuclear strategy of massive retaliation--policies which would invite a major crisis with our allies, including Israel.', 'Number two, Mr. Carter told you, and I quote, ""I have stressed the necessity for a strong defense, tough and muscular, adequate to maintain our freedom under any conceivable circumstances."" I say to you, the gentleman on other occasions has advocated defense cuts of $5 to $7 billion, delaying our strategic bomber program, withdrawing from overseas bases, and cutting off military aid to vital allies. I say to you, if we do any or all of these things it would be impossible to have a defense adequate to maintain our freedom and the freedom of our friends.', ""Finally, I seem to recall that the shepherd boy, David, was both tough and muscular. It's a good thing he also had the most advanced weapon system of that day."", 'Number three, the gentleman told you, ""We have allowed virtually unlimited sales of arms to countries around the world, a policy as cynical as it is dangerous."" I tell you, most of our arms sales in military aid goes to key countries like Israel and Iran. I assume he is not proposing to cut off Israel.', ""Does the gentleman want Soviet arms to have a monopoly in the world? Does he want our adversaries to arm not only the radical Arabs but also the more moderate Arabs? Does Mr. Carter honestly consider his own country's bipartisan policies more cynical and less moral than the Soviet Union's?And now, back to my nice nonpartisan speech."", 'As America celebrates its 200th anniversary, there is a new maturity in our national pride. There is a new awareness that ours is a nation of many faiths and denominations--Jewish, Catholic, Protestant, and others--all equally honored and all equally separated and protected from government by the Constitution of the United States. A fresh optimism grows from self-confidence and mutual trust and from a reliable, stable, enduring philosophy of government.', ""Just as B'nai B'rith honors a sacred Covenant, so does our Nation at home and abroad. Ours is a covenant with freedom. As descendants of those who found sanctuary and fulfillment in this great land, we know that freedom is indivisible. Tyranny and terrorism abroad endanger freedom at home. We are our brother's keeper."", 'Our own Bicentennial Independence Day was enhanced by an event that day at Entebbe Airport in Uganda1 That action of liberation freed our own hearts to fuller understanding of the universal meaning of independence--and the courageous action sometimes required to preserve it.', 'A free people must never capitulate to terrorism. That is why I long ago asked for mandatory prison sentences for airplane hijackers. Certainty of punishment prevents crime. I have strongly urged international action to stamp out terrorism wherever it occurs.', 'America has always been a land of new beginnings. Our ancestors who came to these shores made a new beginning. They saw America as a promised land. As we approach the Jewish New Year, many Americans know that we are making a new start in our national life.', 'Something wonderful happened to America in the last 2 years. Together, we overcame a time of torment at home and abroad, military involvements and economic threats, assassinations and wrongdoing in high places. We recaptured the spirit of 1776.', 'We believe in the hopes of our revolutionary founders and our immigrant ancestors. We found new meaning in their vision of free men and free women enjoying limited government and unlimited opportunity. We renew our commitment to those less fortunate than ourselves. We know that the United States of America is sound. We are secure. We are on the march to full economic recovery and a better quality of life for all Americans.', ""America's salvation is not in a revival of outdated social experiments financed by you who pay the taxes and obey the laws. I see no excuse whatsoever for arbitrary quotas on the basis of race, religion, or national origin in employment or education. In the name of justice for some, we must not do injustice to others. Opportunities should be open to all Americans on an equal basis. That is basic to the finest American principles of liberty and justice for all."", 'When I became President 2 years ago, I pledged to be President to all of the people. I renew that pledge today and support it, not with vague plans and vacillating promises, but with a proven record of performance.', 'Two years ago the scene was grim. Could we muster the unity and will to overcome our domestic turmoil? Could we stand up for freedom? We not only could but we did.', 'Today, not a single American is at war anywhere on the face of this Earth. America is at peace and seeks peace for all countries.', 'Look what has happened in the Middle East. The United States has helped bring about a momentum towards peace that has no parallel in Middle East history. Every American can stand up with pride for what this country helped to do. Two agreements were reached for the separation of forces on the Egyptian and Syrian fronts. Buffer zones were created to protect against a surprise attack-and every war between Israel and Egypt, its Arab neighbors, has grown out of surprise attack or fear of it. The forces of moderation--leaders who were willing to commit themselves to the peace process--were strengthened. The disruptive role of those opposed to the peace process has steadily declined.', 'The United States has fashioned new institutions of energy cooperation with its major allies, including contingency measures to safeguard against a new oil embargo.', ""America's important contacts with the Arab world grew again. The resettlement of cities along the Suez Canal and the clearing of the Canal for international traffic gave practical evidence of a turn towards peace."", 'Then, just a year ago, came the Sinai agreement--a dramatic milestone, the first Arab-Israeli agreement that was not just an armistice in the aftermath of hostilities. It was a political as wall as a military step; it was intended by both sides as a significant advance toward peace. In that agreement both Egypt and Israel pledged:', '--that ""the conflict between them and in the Middle East shall not be resolved by military force but by peaceful means"";', '--and ""they are determined to reach a final and just peace settlement by means of negotiations called for by the Security Council Resolution 338""; and', '--that they will ""not... resort to the threat or the use of force or military blockade against each other.""', 'As a result the danger of war and destruction was further reduced for both sides. Not a single young Israeli or a single young Egyptian has since died fighting in the Sinai.', 'There is no precedent for the promise of lasting and just peace in the Middle East which this agreement has opened up. Both Prime Minister Rabin and President Sadat believe the agreement is the possible turning point.Prime Minister Rabin, who has been my personal friend since he was Ambassador here and I was in the Congress, reported to his Parliament on June 15 this year, and I quote:', '""I note with satisfaction that during the past 2 years, relations between the United States and Israel have become closer.', '""Our governments have arrived at a common approach regarding the desirable political direction on the road to peace and in the development of processes of peace... there has been no erosion in the position and in the attitude of the Administration, the Congress, and the American public, toward Israel.', '""Relations between the United States and Israel remain firm... it will never be superfluous to emphasize and reemphasize the feeling of gratitude and appreciation that the people, the Knesset and the Government in Israel maintain toward the United States for its stand on Israel\'s side.""', 'The negotiating process will continue. The progress made has withstood the dangerous conflict in Lebanon, and I believe it helped to prevent that tragic warfare from spilling over into a wider confrontation.', 'I intend to pursue further progress, because it is right for America, right for Israel, right for the Arabs, indeed right for all the peoples throughout this world. I do not promise you it will be easy.I can tell you what I will do:', 'There will be no imposed solutions, but agreements whose terms are hammered out between the parties as in the Sinai agreement. There will be no one-sided concessions, but a balanced quid pro quo in exchange for everything given up. We will proceed as we have in the closest, constant consultation with Israel before, during, and after any negotiations.', ""A strong Israel is essential to peace and to the national security interests of the United States. From the time I first ran for Congress in 1948, I recognized the justice of Israel's rebirth and its importance to the United States. I am proud to stand on my consistent 28-year record of support for Israel. You know where I stand. The funds I proposed for Israel in my first two budgets totaled over $4 billion for 27 months. These figures speak more eloquently than words."", ""I am proud that my ambassadors at the United Nations have stood up and spoken out for the elementary principle of fairness that Americans believe in. I tell you now that we will fight any measure that condemns Zionism as racism or that attempts to deny Israel her full rights of membership in the United Nations. The United States will stand firm in its commitment to Israel's security and survival."", ""America's policy of peace through strength has proven itself in the Middle East and throughout the world. Nobody questions our dedication to peace, and nobody doubts our willingness to use our strength when America's vital interests are at stake--and we will."", 'A strong defense is the best insurance for peace. But our strength has never rested upon arms alone. It is rooted in our mutual commitment to the highest standards of ethics and morality. Take the Arab boycott as an example. This involves both moral and legal questions, domestic as well as international issues. It is easy to escalate emotionally, but not nearly so easy to resolve rationally.', 'I opposed Arab boycott practices when I was in the Congress. I have always opposed discrimination. America was born as a refuge from discrimination.', 'As President, I have taken the strongest executive action in American history against foreign economic practices that discriminate against American citizens. Last November, I set forth a detailed program of administrative orders and regulations, now in force, which prohibit any discrimination in export transactions based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.2 Our moral and legal opposition to the Arab boycott of Israel has been made forcefully clear, not only to foreign governments but to the American business community. This campaign, together with careful diplomacy and the efforts of individual U.S. firms, has resulted in the easing of boycott practices and an effective end to open discrimination.', 'This morning I reiterate my determination to make further progress, if necessary by legislation, so that Government officials at all levels and the American people will know that I mean business.', 'And I can tell you, I will continue to seek further progress on the issue of emigration from the Soviet Union. I raised it personally with General Secretary Brezhnev. I have discussed it on many occasions with my former colleagues in the House and in the Senate, with the determination to restore the prior rates of emigration.', 'As a government and as a nation, we continue to stress the importance attached by all Americans to the basic human right to live where one chooses in this world today.', 'A moral and ethical government promises its citizens no more than it can deliver and delivers all that it promises. For too long the American people have been promised panaceas for which we are still paying in credibility and in cash.', 'My record is one of performance, not promises. My record is one of realism, not rhetoric. My record is one of experience, not expediency. Under our system, in a national election candidates will naturally disagree on political philosophy. That is why I was delighted when Mr. Carter accepted my challenge for a nationally televised debate on the real issues facing 215 million Americans.', 'It is still my fervent hope that this campaign will be pursued in keeping with the best American traditions. America has no place for those who would set brother against brother, group against group, American against American. America did not rise to the heights by catering to fear and to prejudice. We succeeded through courage, decency, commonsense. We are all equal in the eyes of God.', 'My administration will go on working for a better world. We have absolutely no reason to fear our adversaries abroad as long as we remain strong and true to our principles. Our system has proven its superiority in every way. In remaining vigilant we must never abandon our vision or our spiritual values.', 'In the words of the New Testament, ""Let us [therefore] follow after the things which make for peace,"" heeding still the Old Testament which encourages us to ""seek peace, and pursue it.""', 'As we must never lose our vigilance, neither must we ever lose our vision.', 'Thank you very much.']"

That was some years ago, but as has been indicated, Michigan and Ford have been winners ever since.', 'I have come home to Michigan to share with you my views of America in 1976 and my hopes for America in the next 4 years, and beyond.', ""During the last 2 years, in the aftermath of a difficult war and a painful ordeal of economic adversity and political crisis, we reached a critical turning point in America's history."", 'Throughout most of your lives, America has faced turmoil. Some of our most beloved leaders have been assassinated. There was a war we could not either win or end. There were destructive riots on our streets and on our campuses. We suffered runaway inflation and the worst recession in 40 years. We were betrayed by corruption at the highest levels of our Government.', 'Fortunately, the skies are far brighter. My administration has restored trust in the White House. My administration has turned the economy around. We are in the midst of a growing prosperity. We have peace and the capability and will to keep it.', 'Through all of this, we found in ourselves a basic strength which has proven mightier than our armaments, more precious than our great store of national wealth, and as enduring as our Constitution.', 'As I said on taking the oath of office as President 2 years ago, ""Our long national nightmare is over."" In the last 2 years, the United States of America has made an incredible comeback, and we are not through yet.', ""In 200 years as a free people, much has changed in our Nation, but America's basic goals remain the same:"", '--Americans want a job with a good future.', '--Americans want homes and decent neighborhoods and schools where our children can get a quality education.', '--Americans want physical security, safety against war and crime, safety against pollution in the water we drink and in the air we breathe.', '--We want medical and hospital care when we are sick at costs that will not wipe out our savings.', '--We want the time and opportunity to enlarge our experience through recreation and travel.', 'We Americans are proud people. We cherish our inalienable rights: the right to speak our minds; the right to choose the men and women who enact and enforce our laws; the right to stand equal before the law regardless of sex, age, race, or religion; the right of a farmer, businessman or worker, and consumer to bargain freely in the economic marketplace; the right to worship as we choose. It all adds up to the great American dream.', 'These are the goals which every politician and every citizen has for America. They are not some mystic vision of the future. They are the continuing agenda for action.', 'And, so, the question in this campaign of 1976 is not who has the better vision of America. The question is: Who will act to make that vision a reality?', 'The American people are ready for the truth, simply spoken, about what government can do for them and what it cannot and what it should not do. They will demand performance, not promises; specifics, not smiles.', ""There are some in this political year who claim that more government, more spending, more taxes, and more control on our lives will solve our problems. More government is not the solution, better government is. It is time we thought of new ways to make government a capable servant and not a meddling master. Let's get down to cases; Let's talk about jobs."", ""Today, 88 million Americans are gainfully employed--more than ever before in American history. But that is not good enough. My immediate goal is 2 1/2 million new jobs every year with emphasis on youth, especially the minorities. And I don't mean demeaning, dead end jobs paid for out of the Federal treasury, but permanent jobs with a future generated by the demands of a healthy economy."", 'Can we do it? We have done it. We proved once and for all that you can cut inflation in half and add 4 million new jobs in just 17 months. We did it with tax cuts that allowed Americans to spend more of their own money. We did it with tax incentives that encouraged job production. We did it by letting our free economic system do what it does better than any other system in the world-produce.', ""But I won't be satisfied until every American who wants a job can find a job. I am particularly concerned that there are too many young Americans who cannot find a good job or get the training and the experience they need to find a job."", ""Americans have long since recognized the importance of assuring that every high school graduate who is willing, able, and qualified be able to go to college. We have done so through grants, loans, and scholarships. I believe we can apply the same principle to create a program for young people who choose not to go to college but want a job at which they can learn a trade, a craft, or practical business skills. It can be done. Let's put America--all of America--to work."", ""Once a good job is secured, it's an American tradition to put some of those earnings toward a family home, but nowadays--with interest rates too high, down payments too high, and even monthly payments too high--home ownership is not within the reach of many Americans, particularly young Americans beginning a career or marriage. My goal is homeownership for every American family that wants to own a home and is willing to work for and save for it."", 'Here is how I will meet that goal. First, I will continue to pursue economic policies, including tight control of unnecessary Federal spending which will hold inflation down, reduce interest rates, cut your taxes, increasing your purchasing power, and making more funds available for home mortgages.', ""Second, it is time we did something more about the down payment requirements, which so many people can't afford. I will recommend changes in FHA loans to reduce down payments on lower- and middle-priced homes by up to 50 percent."", 'Third, I will direct the Department of Housing and Urban Development to accelerate implementation of a new Federal guarantee program to lower monthly payments in the early years of homeownership and gradually increase them as the family income goes up.', ""A good job, a good home--now let's talk about the good health we must have to appreciate both."", 'My goal is an America where health care is not only the best in the world but is both accessible and affordable. But raising Federal taxes by $70 billion a year for a Government-dominated health insurance program is not the way to do it. That path leads to more bureaucracy, more fraud, more taxes, and second-class medical care.', 'That is what I am against. Here is what I am for. As our first priority, I have recommended protection against the costs of a catastrophic or prolonged illness for the aged and the disabled--ensuring that never again will they have to pay more than $750 a year for medical care. People should not have to go broke to get well.', ""Next, I proposed to the Congress last spring a major reform in Federal health programs. We should combine 16 overlapping and confused Federal health programs, including the scandal-ridden Medicaid program, into one $10 billion program that distributes the Federal funds more equitably among the States and ensures that those who need these services get first-class care. It's sad but true, America is still awaiting action by the Congress on this urgently needed legislation."", ""Now, let's turn to an area of special concern to this audience--education. One of the most urgent problems is to create a climate in every classroom where teachers can teach and students can learn. Quality education for every young American is my administration's goal. Major reforms are necessary in the relationship between the National, State, and local units of government, so that teachers can spend their time teaching instead of filling out Federal forms. Federal aid is necessary, but Federal aggravation must stop."", 'Nine months ago, I proposed to the Congress that we replace 24 paper shuffling educational bureaucracies with a single Federal program which would provide $3,300 million in direct aid to elementary and secondary schools throughout this country. The Congress has not acted.', 'Once again this Congress has shown itself to be sitting dead in the water and, I might add, addicted to the status quo. The American people deserve better representation than that, and they will demand it on November 2.', ""We must ensure that low-income students have access to higher education. We must also find ways through the tax system to ease the burden on families who choose to send their children to nonpublic schools and to help families cope with the expenses of a college education. In this administration the education need of America's middle-income families will neither be forgotten or forsaken. Education is the key to a better life."", 'The prevention of crime is essential to making our lives secure. The Constitution demands that we ensure domestic tranquility, and that is what I called for in my crime message to the Congress about a year ago. Most crimes are committed by hardened, career criminals who know no other life than the life of crime. The place for those people is not on our streets but in the jails. The rights of the law-abiding society, the rights of the innocent victims of crime must be fully protected.', ""And finally, we must give Americans the chance to enjoy America. I have outlined a $1,500 million program to expand and to improve our national park system over the next 10 years. This means more national parks, more recreation areas, more wildlife sanctuaries, more urban parks and historic sites. Let's make this America's Bicentennial birthday gift to all of our future generations."", 'Today, America enjoys the most precious gift of all. We are at peace. No Americans are in combat anywhere on the Earth and none are being drafted, and I will keep it that way.', 'We will be as strong as we need to be to keep the peace, to deter aggression, and to protect our national security. But if our foreign policy is to have public support, it must represent the moral values of the American people. What is more moral than peace with freedom and security in the United States?', 'As the leader of the free world, America has a special responsibility to explore new paths to peace for all mankind. It is a responsibility we have not shirked. We have been a force for peace in the Middle East, not only in promoting new agreements, but in building a structure for a more lasting peace.', 'We have worked for peace with the Soviet Union, not only in resolving our many conflicts but in building a world where nuclear armaments are brought under control.', 'We are working for peace in Europe where the armies of two major coalitions confront each other.', ""We will continue to build our relationship with the People's Republic of China, which contributes importantly to peace and stability throughout the world."", ""Now, in the face of a new challenge, we are on a mission for peace in southern Africa. This is the first administration in America's history to develop a comprehensive, affirmative African policy. This policy has won respect and trust on. that troubled continent. At my direction, Secretary Kissinger is now engaged in an intensive effort to help all the parties, black and white, involved in the mounting crisis in southern Africa, to find a peaceful and just solution to their many and complex differences. The African parties in the very grave and complicated problems of Namibia and Rhodesia have encouraged us to help them in the search for peace and justice. We are also backed in our efforts by our European allies with traditional bonds to the African Continent. In particular, we are working in close collaboration with the United Kingdom which has historical and legal responsibility in Rhodesia."", 'Success will depend fundamentally on the cooperation of the parties directly concerned. We will not and we cannot impose solutions, but will depend upon the good will and determined efforts of the African parties themselves to achieve negotiated settlements.', ""We seek no special advantage for ourselves in these negotiations. We share with the people of Africa these fundamental objectives: a peaceful outcome; a future of majority rule and minority rights; a prospect of widening human dignity and economic progress; and a unified and independent Africa, free from outside intervention or threat. The tortuous path that leads to these goals is not an easy one. The risks are great. But America's interests and America's moral purpose summon our efforts. Despite the rigors of a great national election, I have persisted in carrying out this new policy towards Africa--not because it is expedient--but because it is right."", 'I pledge to you that under my administration, American foreign policy will serve the interests of our country and our people; it will be true to our great heritage of the past, fulfill our purposes in the present, and contribute to our best vision of the future.', 'It\'s not enough for anyone to say ""trust me."" Trust must be earned. Trust is not having to guess what a candidate means. Trust is leveling with the people before the election about what you are going to do after the election. Trust is not being all things to all people, but being the same thing to all people. Trust is not cleverly shading words so that each separate audience can hear what it wants to hear, but saying plainly and simply what you mean--and meaning what you say.', 'I am proud of the maturity of the American people who demand more honesty, truthfulness, and candor of their elected representatives. The American people, particularly our young people, cannot be expected to take pride--or even participate-in a system of government that is defiled and dishonored, whether in the White House or in the halls of the Congress. Personal integrity is not too much to ask of public servants. We should accept nothing less.', ""As we enter the last 7 weeks of this national election, a new poll indicates that as many as 65 million Americans will not vote in November. Some people have said that they are not excited about any of this year's candidates. Let them be excited about America. Let them be excited about their own capacity to grow and change, about our Nation's capacity to grow and change, and even about the evolution, with their help, of the candidate of their choice."", ""In this year of 1976, I stand before you as the last President of America's first 200 years. But with your help, I also intend to be the first President of America's new generation of freedom. Working together we can build an America that does not merely celebrate history, but writes it; that offers limited government and unlimited opportunity; that concerns itself with the quality of life; that proves individual liberty is still the key to mutual achievement and national progress.And when the history of this great era is written, future generations will look back at America in 1976 and say, yes, they were 200 years old but they had really only just begun."", 'Thank you very much.']"

We are delighted to be here in the South. As I said, we are delighted because I want to talk affirmatively about what we are going to do and what we have done in the last 2 years.', 'Your President believes that the Federal Government spends much too much money. Your President tried to cut the rate of growth of Federal spending by 50 percent. We made a little headway. But in the next 4 years, we will do even better, so you can have more money in your pocket and not in the Federal Treasury.', 'I believe that by holding the rate of spending down, we can give to the taxpayers of this country the kind of tax reform that makes sense. It makes sense to you. And that is why I recommended a $28 billion tax decrease with an increase in the personal exemptions from $750 to $1,000, so you will have more of your hard-earned cash in your pockets.', 'All of you, I know, from talking to Congressman Dave Treen and Congressman Henson Moore, that you are as concerned as I am that the United States be strong militarily. Let me say that in the 2 years that I have been your President, I have recommended to the Congress the two strongest military budgets in the history of this Nation. And we are going to keep America number one, period.', 'One way we have tried to hold down the spending of the Federal Government is to veto 56 [58] bills passed by the Congress. Forty-two of those vetoes have been sustained, and we have saved you, the taxpayers of this country, $9 billion. And I might add a postscript: The Vice-Presidential candidate on the other side, who is a big spender, has voted to override every veto that I have made, which proves, without any doubt, he is the biggest spender in the United States Senate.', ""On the Fourth of July, we had a wonderful celebration of America's 200th birthday. We have had a tough 2 years. We were divided. We have healed those divisions, and America today has a new spirit, a new spirit that has given us the capability to move out of our troubles into brighter skies."", 'Now we have some new problems to solve to improve the quality of our lives: a job for everybody who wants to work, a house for everybody who will work and save so he can have that home in a decent neighborhood, the best health care in the world, the solution to the problem of crime, and greater opportunities for recreation. Those are the visions and the goals of all of us in Lutcher, in Gramercy, in Louisiana, in Michigan, California, and in Texas.', 'We have the greatest form of government in the history of mankind.

I want your vote.', ""I want to thank the Governor's wife, Elaine Edwards, who has, and I am proud to say, indicated publicly that she thinks President Ford will be a good President for the next 4 years.

Since I became your President 2 years ago, we've had some tough times. We had to restore trust in the White House. We had to turn the economy around from inflation of over 12 percent to where it is now, under 6 percent. And it is going to get better with the kind of policies we have. We had to extricate ourselves from Vietnam, keep the peace through our military superiority and our diplomatic skill."", ""But let me talk about some of the bread and butter issues that interest you. I believe that the Federal Government spends too much of your tax dollars. In order to reduce Federal spending, I vetoed 56 [58] bills sent to me by the Congress. They have sustained 42, and we saved $9 billion of your tax money. And that's progress."", ""I might add that Senator Mondale voted to override every one of the vetoes that I sent hock to the Congress. He is a big spender and way left, and we don't want him as Vice President."", 'But I also think that what we ought to have is another tax cut. I recommended that the Congress give to the American people a $28 billion tax reduction so that you would have more money that you worked hard to earn for your family, your children, your wife. The Congress unfortunately only gave us half a loaf. And I promise to you that in January of next year, when I am sworn in as the next President of the United States, we will recommend another tax reduction.', ""All of us from wherever we come in the United States are very interested in our national security.

And the net result is, we have saved $9 billion of your tax dollars that you worked so hard to earn.', 'Let me add just a footnote: We might have sustained another veto or two if we had gotten any cooperation from Senator Fritz Mondale, who wants to be Vice President. Let me tell you a secret: He has voted to override every veto that I have sent back to Congress. Do you want him as your Vice President?', ""But let's talk about taxes. A few months ago I sent to the Congress a proposal to cut your Federal income taxes by $28 billion, which would mean, as an example, that when you file your income tax return next April, instead of having a personal exemption of $750, under the President Ford proposal you would have had $1,000 personal exemption. Isn't that what you want? And if you have a family of four, you could have an additional $1,000 personal exemption. That's the kind of tax reform that this administration is for, and we are going to get it. If we don't this year, we're going to get it next year."", ""I know of the great historical tradition of the people of Louisiana. You believe in a strong national defense. You believe that the United States must be number one in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Marines. Since I've been President, I have submitted to the Congress the two largest military budgets in the history of this country, in either peacetime or war.

We are going to be number one and stay there."", 'On the Fourth of July, this country had a tremendous 200th birthday anniversary. From Alaska to Florida, from Maine to California, from Louisiana to Michigan, everybody felt good, because in the last 2 years we have healed our divisiveness, we have all come together with a great hope, with a good vision about the future of America.', 'That means a good job for everybody who wants to work. That means a home for every family that wants to work and save. That means the best medical care that we can give to our people. That means freedom on the streets from crime. That means an opportunity for all of us to enjoy the blessings of our national parks and recreation areas. But it also means that we are at peace. And the United States is strong enough to maintain the peace, and we are diplomatically skillful enough to keep the peace.

And I want to thank all of them, through you, for the warm, warm welcome given to Betty and myself.', 'Let me tell you why I think we can win Louisiana. All of you know that when I became President in August of 1974 this country was in deep trouble. The American people had lost faith in the White House. We were suffering inflation of over 12 percent, and we were on the brink of a serious economic recession. And we were still deeply involved in Vietnam. We had troubled times. And in the last 2 years, we have turned that ship of state around.', ""It's taken a little longer than I wanted--and I'm sure you wanted--but look at the progress that we've made. Instead of inflation over 12 percent, it's under 6 percent. Instead of losing jobs, we have gained 4 million jobs in the last 17 months, and we are going to get more and more in the future. And I won't be satisfied until every person who wants to work will get a job and a good job."", 'We are out of the war in Vietnam. We have the peace, and we have an all-volunteer military force, and we are going to keep it that way.

I promise that we will get an additional 2,500,000 jobs each year in order to satisfy the young people coming into the labor market."", 'Our second objective is to make it possible for every family, particularly the young who want to save and buy a home, to have a home in a decent neighborhood.', ""Some of us are deeply concerned, as you are, about the crime rate in this country, but we've made some progress. Two years ago, the crime rate was 18 percent. Last year it was 9 percent, and for the first 6 months of this year the crime rate is 3 percent, and that's a lot of progress. And we can take some credit for it, and we will."", ""In the next 4 years, we will increase the educational opportunity for young people; we will make our health facilities and services much more available. There is no reason whatsoever why anybody should go broke in this country to get well. And they won't under the Ford administration."", ""I've been talking about the quality of life, and that's what we want to give to our country in the months ahead."", 'Let me take one quick minute to talk about some things we have tried to do that I think give you some concrete indication of what we are going to do in the future.', 'Less than a year ago, I recommended a $28 billion tax decrease, 75 percent for the individual taxpayers and 25 percent for business. Included--and this is what is meaningful to you--I recommended that we increase the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000. And for a family of four that means a tax saving (deduction) of $1,000. The middle-income people have been shortchanged, and under the Ford administration we are going to give them the equity they deserve.', 'Let me thank you all. Just a comment or two about our long-range goal and future.', 'On the Fourth of July, we had a tremendous, exhilarating experience. We celebrated our 200th birthday. The length and the breadth of this country there was a new spirit, a new vision.', ""I think because we have the character of our people, because we have the kind of government that is surpassing any kind in the history of mankind, we have the opportunity to give to our children and our children's children the blessings that we inherited from our predecessors."", ""And I pledge to you that the first 4 years of this next century under a Ford administration will open the floodgates to blessings that we haven't had, blessings that we can get, blessings for a better America."", ""That's what this administration is all about, and that's why I want your vote November 2.

And we are here, and we are here to win.', 'It has been a great experience coming along the coast to see all the wonderful recreation areas that you have where you can fish, where you can hunt, where you can really spend a wonderful time after you work or go to school. But speaking of hunting, I want to make one comment because I think it is vitally important for all of us who have a great dedication to the Constitution. No law-abiding citizen should be deprived of the right to have a gun in his possession under our Constitution.', 'But let me talk for just a minute, if I might, about where we have been and where we are going. Two years ago when I became President, August 9, 1974, this country was in tough shape. I recall vividly, as I think you do, the American people--for understandable reasons--had lost faith and trust in the White House. The American people were faced with economic conditions which were very difficult. The cost of living was 12 percent or more, we were on the brink of a serious recession, and we were still involved in Vietnam.', 'That was a tough time. But something really wonderful happened in this country. We got together. We realized what a blessing we had in the kind of government we have, and instead of the division that we had among our people, we began to heal. And the net result is that 2 years later we have made an incredible comeback, and we are going to do better and better.', ""But let's talk about the future because that is what we really are all here about. I appreciate your coming. I am grateful for you to give me the opportunity to talk affirmatively. What do we have in mind for the future?"", ""We want a better quality of life now that we have taken care of the immediate problems. What we want is a job for everybody who wants to work, a meaningful job. And I won't be satisfied until we have a job for everybody who wants a job and who will look for a job. And I don't mean a dead-end job for the Government. I mean a job where you have got an opportunity for advancement, where you can make yourself a career. We also want everybody who will work and save to have a home in a decent neighborhood. And under the next 4 years of this administration, that is what we will get. And we want to get rid of crime on our streets. We want to give people the kind of health care that they can afford. Nobody should have to go broke just to get well."", 'Now let me talk just a minute about the national security. This is my third visit to Pascagoula. I came down here in 1962 with my wife, Betty. She commissioned a new submarine over here in the Ingalls shipbuilding yards.', ""But let me talk about the Navy and what the Ingalls shipbuilding yard means to the kind of a Navy that we have to have. We are being challenged by the Soviet Union on the sea. We have had our Navy gradually go down in ship numbers, although we've done very well in tonnage. But you have a big shipbuilding contract out here in Ingalls shipbuilding. I understand 27,000 people work here building those fine ships. I compliment you. But let me say this: We need a first-class Air Force; we've got one. We need a superb, first-class Army; we have one. We need an outstanding Marine Corps; we've got one. And we've got a swell, first-class Navy, and you are a big part of it."", 'I am very proud of the fact that I sent to the Congress in the last 2 years the two largest defense budgets in the history of the United States, and I will submit one next year that will be the third largest military budget in the history of the United States. I am not going to cut the defense budget just to appeal to some people. Anybody who says you can cut $5 or $7 or $10 or $15 billion out of the defense budget does not know what he is talking about. The United States is number one, and under the Ford administration we are going to keep it number one, period.', ""One final comment. I will bet all of you in Pascagoula had a tremendous Fourth of July celebration when we celebrated our Nation's 200th birthday. Wasn't it a great day? Wasn't it wonderful?"", ""Well, we are now in our third century, and we have got a new spirit. We are going on the offensive. That is what Bear knows how to do with those good ball teams he has. But let me say this: We are healed. We are going forward. We are on the upbeat. America is going someplace, and it is all to the good. Let's work to build a better America in our third century."", ""Now let me ask one question--one question. I have had a wonderful day in Mississippi, I am looking forward to going to Alabama. You people in Mississippi have such a strong patriotism. I love being down here. It has been a great day. Let me ask one favor of you. Will you vote for Jerry Ford on November 2? All right, that's a compact. You vote for me--I won't let you down."", 'Thank you very much.']"

People had lost trust in the White House itself. We were having inflation of over 12 percent. We were on the brink of the worst economic recession in the last 40 years. We were still involved in Vietnam. They were troubled times. People were distrustful of one another, and we were divided as a people.', ""But in the last 2 years we have calmed the waters, we have healed the differences between our people, and we have made tremendous strides in turning our economy around. Oh, you can't turn a switch and solve all the problems, but instead of over 12 percent inflation, it's under 6 percent. We've added 4 million jobs in the last 17 months. We're making all kinds of progress to get this economy healthy again. Of course, we're no longer in Vietnam, and we have peace, and we have the military capability to keep it."", ""But let me talk for just a minute about the military. I'm mighty proud of the people out at Keesler Air Force Base. You're a very vital part of this great national defense team that we have. I believe that the United States in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, we're unsurpassed. And under a Ford administration we're going to stay number one. In the last 2 years that I've sent budgets to the Congress, I have submitted the two largest military budgets in dollars in the .history of this country. And let me be very frank with you. Nobody can honestly cut the defense budget $5 to $7 billion, as my opponent does, and keep America number one. You must do it the way I want it."", ""But let's talk about some of the things that we want for the young people, the old people, and all of us. We have to think of the quality of life now that we have gotten our economy turned around and we are out of Vietnam and trust has been restored in the White House. We want everybody to have a job that wants a job--a meaningful job, not a dead-end job under some of these subsidized programs. We want the economy of this country to give the people of this country a job where they can have an opportunity for advancement, to better themselves, and have some security. We want the American people, those who will work and save, to have a decent home in a decent neighborhood. We want the crime problem solved, and we are making headway in that regard. We want the best health care for your people so they can afford what is available. There's no reason why anybody in this country should go broke just to get well."", ""And as I look at the next 4 years and see what you have done in Mississippi, what they have done in 49 other States, what 215 million Americans can do working together, I'm a tremendous optimist. On the Fourth of July of this year, we celebrated our 200th birthday, It was a great occasion. And the net result is there's a new spirit in America--a spirit of togetherness, a spirit of enthusiasm."", ""We have the most wonderful opportunity in the next 4 years to lay the foundation for a great third century. We'll do it working together. And I want the opportunity to be your President during that period of time."", 'Can I ask you one question?

It's been tremendous in Mississippi and it will be good in Alabama, and it will be good in Florida. We want to win."", 'Let me express my deep appreciation to Trent Lott and Thad Cochran. They are outstanding Members of the Congress. Send them back. We need them, and you need them.', 'And let me say to Mayor Lang, I will tell you this is a tremendous welcome, and I appreciate your help and the help of other local officials.', 'Let me take just a minute to speak about the things that concern all of us. If you will refresh your memory, 2 years ago, this country was in trouble. We were divided. There had been a great loss of trust in the American people in their government and in the White House. There had been a tremendous adverse impact because inflation was over 12 percent. We were on the brink of the worst recession in 40 years. We had still an involvement in Southeast Asia. It was not a very good time for America.', ""But I found that the character of the American people, the kind of government we have, has given us a chance to turn the ship of state around. And in the last 2 years we have made incredible progress, and we should be proud of it. But the progress we've made is not enough. What we have to do is move from where we are to a better opportunity, more progress."", 'And as I travel around the country, I find that America is on the upbeat. We have restored trust in the White House. We have turned our economy around. Instead of 12-percent inflation, we are down to under 6 percent, and we are going to do better and better.', ""But the way to whip inflation is not to add more Federal spending. The way to whip inflation is to keep the cost of government down, and you will keep the rate of inflation down. One way I've found that we can hold the lid on Federal spending is to veto some of that bad legislation that the Congress sends up to the White House. As a matter of fact, they've sent 58 bills to the Oval Office; we've vetoed them. Forty-two have been sustained, but in the process we have saved the taxpayers of this country $10 billion. That's progress."", 'What we want to do is to keep the rate of spending down so that we can give more tax relief to the taxpayers of this country. The best way for America to move ahead is for you, the individual citizens who have worked hard in your factories or in your port or in your schools or in the farms around here--the best way for you to make headway is to have that money that you have earned in your pocket and not for some bureaucrat to spend in Washington, D.C.', 'But as we move ahead what we want, among many other things, is to have all of you to have a greater opportunity for recreation. And as I have traveled from New Orleans to here this morning, I have seen some of the wonderful places where you are the beneficiaries of fishing and hunting. Speaking of hunting, let me just make a comment. The law-abiding citizens of this country should not be deprived of the right to have firearms for their own protection, and if you want to go hunting, you should not have to go down and register your firearms with some Federal official.', ""As we drove in I saw this wonderful Seabee unit out there giving me a warm welcome. I want to congratulate them for the superb job that they've done, not only in their Navy capacity but in doing everything they possibly could following Hurricane Camille."", ""But speaking of national defense, this is where an area of decided difference exists between me and my opponent. In the 2 years that I have been President, I have submitted to the Congress the two largest defense budgets in the history of the United States. We had to do it, because Congress had slashed our defense budgets in the last 10 years by an accumulated total of $50 billion. We've turned it around. My opponent wants to cut the Defense Department budget by $5 to $7 billion. That would be disastrous. We need to keep America number one, and under a Ford administration we will. You don't stand up to the pressures around the world by having less power; you need more power, and we are going to keep it that way."", ""One final comment. I know all of you here in Gulfport celebrated, like other people did all over the United States on the Fourth of July, our 200th birthday. I was privileged to travel to a few States and to see literally thousands and thousands and thousands of people. It was the most inspiring day that I've ever spent in my life, because I found that the divisiveness that we had had in America over the last 10 years had been healed. The people from all walks of life were getting together celebrating America's 200th birthday--a great, great occasion--but we are going to keep that upbeat moving."", ""We have to work together in the future to make America a better place for our children and our grandchildren. It's an opportunity for all of us in Mississippi and Michigan, Alaska and Florida, New York and California, to give to us, and mainly to our children and grandchildren, the kind of America that we inherited, but a better America. We will, and we will do it in the next 4 years and during the next 100 years."", 'I thank all of you for coming out here today. It is just wonderful.', 'Can I ask something else of you?

We have made significant progress in reducing inflation from over 12 percent to under 6 percent, but we are going to make more.', 'And let me say this: The best way to win the battle against the cost of living is to reduce the cost of Federal Government. There are some people running for this office of President that want to add more and more spending, bigger and bigger deficits, more and more inflation.', ""We're against that. The Ford administration is going to win the battle against inflation.

I have known Governor Wallace ever since I was the minority leader. He was your Governor. We worked together then; we. worked together when I was Vice President.', 'I have attended a number of conferences where Governors and the President were in session, and our working relationship in trying to solve problems-regardless of whether Governor Wallace is a Democrat and I am a Republican-that was the aim and the objective of our relationship. And I can say without hesitation, I have never known anyone who I could work better with in that relationship, and I thank you very, very much.', ""You don't know how pleased I am, how honored I am with the comments by my long-time friend, Bear Bryant. He is right. We graduated--he from the University of Alabama, and I from the University of Michigan. He got into coaching, and I did.

Thank you very much, Bear."", 'When I made the acceptance speech in Kansas City, I made a pledge, and I used these words: I said that I will not concede a single State, I will not concede a single vote.

We have been in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and we are going to Florida after we leave here tonight."", 'But what impresses me is that we come to these wonderful States, where I think we have great support, and I think with all the enthusiasm and drive and the right principles we are going to surprise some people down here in these States.', ""Let me tell you why. As Coach Bryant said, on August 9, 1974, when I became President, there was a pretty dark cloud in this country. We had gone through some traumatic experiences. The people were divided. There was great unhappiness. We had had riots in our streets and riots on our campuses. We were facing a serious economic problem. There had been a loss of trust and faith in the White House itself. We were still involved in Vietnam. It wasn't a very pleasant time."", 'As Coach Bryant said, we were back about on our own goal line.

We have restored faith and trust in the White House. We have turned the economy around from inflation of over 12 percent to under 6 percent. We have added 4 million jobs from the depth of the recession in the last 17 months, meaningful jobs with a chance for advancement. We are going to do better. And I won't be satisfied, as your President, until we get a job for everybody who wants to work and will work and will look for work."", ""Then we have extricated ourselves from Vietnam. We have peace. We have the military strength and the diplomatic skill to keep the peace. We don't do it through the draft, we do it through an all-volunteer military force. And we are going to keep the peace not only at borne by doing a better job in solving our problems of crime but we are going to give the leadership throughout this whole world to keep the peace that is so essential so the blessings of America can be spread beyond our own shores."", 'But let me make a comment about our military strength. And I am so pleased that in the background, if the light was such, that we could see the Coast Guard Aviation Training facility. You should be complimented on the fine job they do, and we are proud of them.', ""That brings up the subject that I think is of vital importance. I am very proud of the fact that in the last 2 years I have submitted to the Congress and to the American people the two largest military budgets in the history of America--not for the purpose of making war, but for the purpose of preserving peace. And we have turned the situation around so that now Congress, after cutting defense expenditures for the last 10 years some $50 billion--we have convinced the Congress that it's important, it's vital, it's essential that America remain number one, that America will be number one so we can keep the peace, deter aggression, and protect our national security."", ""Well, I want to warn you about one thing. I am dismayed that my opponent thinks you can make a stronger Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps by cutting them $5 to $7 to $9 to $15 billion. You can't do it. He ought to know better. And under President Ford, we won't."", 'But as long as we build our military capability for the preservation of peace here and abroad, we have to do things to build up our economy so that we can take full advantage of the natural blessings that we have here at home.', 'I can recall hearing about the Tennessee-Tombigbee project when I first went to the Congress in 1949. Nothing has pleased me more than to see the construction that is underway for this great public works project. And let me say without hesitation that the Ford administration will make certain that it will proceed and proceed at full funding. In 1976, we recommended about $65 billion [million]. In 1977, it was about $85 to $90 billion [million], and the latest figures for planning for the next fiscal year, something over $100 million. That is the kind of support that the Ford administration gives to the Tennessee-Tombigbee--a good project which we want not just for you but for all America.', 'But we have to think in even broader terms than that. We have to think about the quality of life that we want for 215 million Americans for the next 4 years and the next century. What are those things? I mentioned earlier that we want a job for everybody who wants to work, who will work, and will look for work.', ""We want a home for every family that will work and save, and we want that home for them in a decent neighborhood.

There is no reason in this country why a person should go broke just to get well, and they won't under this administration."", 'Then, every one of us for the last 4 or 5 years has worried about crime. The crime rate went up in 1974. It dropped off a little in 1975. We have some encouraging news in the first 6 months of 1976. It is down to a net gain of 3 percent. But we have to make certain, under our crime legislation, in the courts of this country, that the people who commit the crimes go to jail so that we can protect the innocent victims of crime in America.', ""Well, it's just great to be here in this wonderful State of Alabama. As I was coming into the airport, I was looking forward to seeing Governor Wallace. You know, in 1972 Governor Wallace went up to the State of Michigan. He got involved in the primary on the Democratic ticket. Everybody was saying he didn't have a chance. But you know what he did? He got 51 percent of the vote. I think I will take him to Michigan to help me in 1976."", ""We've had a wonderful Bicentennial anniversary. How many of you felt better on July 4 when we celebrated our 200th birthday? I know I did. I went to Valley Forge; I went to Philadelphia; I went to New York.

This is what will keep America great. And each of us must pledge--regardless of our political faith or belief--our dedication to a better America. I know you will--I will--and I know that America in the next 4 years and the next century will be a greater and greater country just because of us.', ""Now just one final question.

When I was minority leader in the House of Representatives, I worked hard with many others to lower the voting age to 18. Even though some of the experts said young Americans would vote against my party more than for it, I wanted to open up the system, make sure that you had a voice as to what goes on in your Government. But for one reason or another most people your age have never taken advantage of this new right and this new privilege. The experts say the majority probably won't vote in this election. I hope that forecast is wrong, and I believe it is wrong. You have the biggest stake in the country's future. You must take an active interest in the work of your Government."", 'One reason for the low turnout, probably, the low turnout of the past, must be that some of you have been disappointed so many times. Through most of your lives America has been in turmoil. Some of our most beloved leaders were assassinated, including my good friend and our President, John F. Kennedy, who spoke here as a candidate in 1960 and whose memory is honored with a plaque in your library. There was a war that seemed to have no end. There were destructive riots in our cities and on some of our campuses. We suffered runaway inflation and the worst recession in 40 years. We were betrayed by wrongdoings at the highest level of our Government.', 'But let me assure you that things are better in the United States of America today, and they are going to get better in the future.', 'In August 9, 1974, as I said on taking the oath of office as President, our long national nightmare is over. In the last 2 years, the United States of America has made an amazing comeback and as I said a moment ago, we are not through yet. In the last 2 years trust has been restored to the White House. We have turned the economy around. We are at peace, and I will keep it that way. We have entered an era of good feeling. We have given the American people a fresh start for the future.', ""On July 4 of this year, we celebrated the biggest birthday party in our Nation's history. America was 200 years old and growing strong in the future. We found ourselves healed and united as never before. We found that we were looking at the future with faith instead of fear. For all our faults, for all of the troubles that we have had in recent years, we felt proud to be Americans, proud of this great country that we live in and work for and will do our best for in the future."", 'We still have our share of serious problems. We still have goals that have not been reached. But we have found a strength in ourselves and in our national character that is more powerful than all of our armaments, more precious than all of our wealth, and as enduring as the United States Constitution.', ""As we look back to the days of the American Revolution, we felt the same strong spirit which guided the courageous men and women who founded this Nation. We realize more vividly than ever before that we are the heirs of the greatest, the most constructive, the most enduring revolution in the history of mankind. And as we move forward into the third century of America's independence, we know that the challenges of the future will be greater than those we faced in the past."", 'Here at home our greatest challenge is to ensure that every American who wants a job can find a job, a job that gives a person pride as well as a paycheck, a job with an opportunity for advancement, a job generated by the demands of a healthy economy, not manufactured by a Big Brother government.', ""We must make it easier for people to buy a home, a home of their own, while they are still young enough to enjoy it. We must make sure that our older people don't have to go broke just to get well. We must make it possible for every young American to get an education of the highest quality, an education that you can use when you get out of school--USC, Michigan, Yale, or any other of the outstanding educational institutions in this country today."", 'We must make sure that our streets and campuses are free from the threat of violent crime. We must try harder to protect our environment, to purify the water that we drink and the air that we breathe. We must enlarge our capacity for recreation, enrich and preserve our treasure of natural beauty and our heritage of history throughout America.', 'We must keep America strong and secure, but with volunteers and not with a military draft. Above all, we must keep the peace that America enjoys today, the peace that finds no Americans in combat anywhere throughout the globe right now. I am the first President in 20 years to stand for election in a time of peace. You are the first generation of college graduates who in 15 years do not have to face the prospects of going to war. And I intend to keep it that way.', 'Keeping peace with freedom is the key to all of our hopes and aspirations. Without peace, we cannot concentrate on improving the quality of life in America. Without freedom, life has no quality at all. Therefore, I will take every possible step to build peace, not only for ourselves but for all of the world. We are taking those steps today toward peace where the going is hardest, but where the stakes are the highest--the Middle East, southern Africa, and the strategic arms limitation talks with the Soviet Union.', 'After so many years of war, we are proud as a nation to stand for peace. We are proud to stand for what is right in the world--human dignity, decency, equality, and freedom.', ""Last night in the debate, I spoke of America's firm support for the aspiration for independence of the nations of Eastern Europe. The United States has never conceded--and never will concede--their domination by the Soviet Union. I admire the courage of the Polish people and have always supported the hopes of Polish Americans for freedom of their ancestral homeland. It is our policy to use every peaceful means to assist countries in Eastern Europe in their efforts to become less dependent on the Soviet Union and to establish closer and closer ties with the West and, of course, the United States of America."", 'I am every much aware of the present plight of the Eastern European nations, and as I declared in this year\'s Captive Nations proclamation [4448], and I quote, ""The United States supports the aspirations for freedom, independence and national self-determination of all peoples. We do not accept foreign domination over any nation,"" period.', 'We really believe, as our founders did, that these are the inalienable rights of people everywhere. We believe that America is a very special country, that in 200 years we have passed from open rebellion against foreign misrule to a peaceful, continuing revolution for the rights of free men and women.', 'If we are to be true to our heritage, Americans must continue to have the confidence that we can control our own lives, that we can leave our children a better world than we found, that government will be under our control, a capable servant and not a meddling master.', 'We did not throw off the bonds of oppressive government in the 18th century only to create one for ourselves two centuries later. The greatest danger I see in America today is the overwhelming of the individual--you and millions like you in this wonderful country being overwhelmed by the massive institutions of government, business, labor, communications--yes, even education. I see government growing too large, too powerful, too costly, too remote, too deeply involved in our daily lives.', 'The mounting troubles in Great Britain, our old and honored ally, offer compelling evidence that we cannot keep relying on government alone to solve all of our problems. Faced with the greatest financial crisis in the history of British democracy, Prime Minister Callaghan, before a recent convention of his Labor Party, had the courage to say, and I quote him, ""Britain for too long has lived on borrowed time, borrowed money, and borrowed ideas. We will fail,"" he said, ""if we think we can buy our way out of our present difficulties by printing confetti money and paying ourselves more than we earn."" That is advice that I think in good conscience we should take. We must not let that happen in America now or in the future. We better avoid it; we can avoid it; and as long as I am President of the United States, we will avoid it.', ""We must have a new generation of freedom in America--not the freedom to shirk our responsibilities and to let the Government assume them, but the freedom to do what we want to do and what we ought to do. With the Government's help--but not at the Government's direction--that is the kind of America that I want. That is why I am a candidate for the Presidency of the United States and why I come here on this wonderful campus and ask you for your help on November 2."", 'Thank you very much.']"

It's a great privilege and a very high honor for me to have the opportunity of being here with you today."", ""Last night, as some of you may know, I engaged in a very serious discussion about the need for maintaining a strong national defense. My opponent and I differ on how to go about that process. One of those differences is represented by the model that you work on, that I have just seen, and I think it's a crucial issue in this campaign."", ""But first, let me congratulate all of you for winning the Zero Defect Award. I'm glad you are not working for the Carter campaign. [Laughter] I might say parenthetically that there are a lot of defects to choose in that campaign, but one of the biggest of Mr. Carter's defects is his opposition to the B-1 bomber."", 'As you and I meet this morning, thousands of American servicemen all around the globe are standing watch, some patrolling borders, some sailing a ship, and some manning our aircraft. As Commander in Chief, I am responsible for each one of them. We owe each one of those young Americans not just our support and our prayers--we owe them the very best equipment that this country can buy.', ""Our current manned bomber, the B-52, is already more than 20 years old, and by the time the B-1 is ready to take its place, the B-52 will be in operation over four decades. I don't believe that any President should ask any serviceman to defend his country in a combat aircraft that is older than he is."", ""Last night, we both agreed on the need for toughness in facing the Soviet Union. But toughness requires more than talk. It requires having the right weapon systems. If we want peace in the world, we have to let our enemies know we're willing to defend the peace. They may not understand that in English, but this B-1 is the message that they will clearly understand."", 'The B-1 is one of the clearest examples as to what is at stake in this campaign. My opponent either favors the cancelling or the delay of the B-1. His running mate in the Senate, Senator Mondale, voted against the B-1 in the Senate no less than three times. They say the B-1 is unnecessary. I certainly hope and pray that is true, but what if those critics are wrong?', ""The very fact that we don't have the B-1 could well invite a challenge from abroad. If we are wrong about buying the B-i, the cost will be measured in dollars and cents. If we are wrong about not buying the B-I, the cost could be well measured in lives and in blood."", ""As President, I will not take that chance. Our children will live in a future where Soviet technology poses an increasing threat to the security of the United States. The B-1 bomber provides graphic proof to our friends and to our enemies that 200 years have not diminished America's commitment to freedom."", ""The B-1 bomber is not the only major difference in this campaign. Another fundamental and critical issue is the proper size of America's defense budget. The issue is simple. Our opponent wants to cut it. We want to keep it intact and keep it strong."", 'Over the last year and a half, our opponents have cited various figures as to how much the defense budget ought to be cut. About a year ago, Mr. Carter said it could be cut $15 billion. A few months ago he changed and said it could be cut $7 to $9 billion, and now the figure they use is $5 to $7 billion.', ""They are vague about the place where those cuts could be made, but the realities of manpower needs and pension requirements and many, many other fixed costs ensure that a cut of that magnitude--whether it's 15, or 7 to 9, or 5 to 7--would have to come from weapon system procurement. That would be a strategic tragedy for America. It would be an economic tragedy for the State of California and other States which do the research and development and build this wonderful weapon system."", 'Our opponent\'s platform amounts to an overall policy of ""fire them and hire them."" First, their $5 to $7 billion in defense cuts would put you and thousands and thousands of others out of work. Then the Humphrey-Hawkins bill would try to put you back to work in dead-end public service jobs. That formula would be a triple disaster. It would mean less defense, it would mean less real employment, it would mean more taxes and more inflation.', 'Our opponents have managed to turn the words of President Teddy Roosevelt upside down. Some of you may recall that Teddy Roosevelt once said, ""Speak softly and carry a big stick."" Our opponents want to speak loudly and carry a fly swatter. Such an attitude is a danger to our military and diplomatic stability abroad and to our economic stability here in America.', 'World peace depends on continued American military strength. Over the years, the workers of California have played a vital role in maintaining that strength and keeping that peace. You have done a great job. In the next 4 years, I am going to see that you keep right on doing it.', 'Thank you. Congratulations.']"

Senator Bellmon and Senator Bartlett tell me you have a pretty good football team in Oklahoma this year. My alma mater, the University of Michigan, learned it the hard way last year.

Dewey, maybe I can win that 2 bucks back again."", ""Tomorrow, I'm going to have the honor of attending the Texas-Oklahoma football game. Anyone here know who's going to win that game tomorrow? I just thought I would ask. As I said, we're stopping down at the Texas State Fair tomorrow, and I may get a question about it. As President, I have to be impartial about the game. I even have to change sides during the half. Of course, if my opponent were there, I am sure he would find some way to sit on both sides at the same time."", ""Now, let me give you some straight talk about taxes and national defense. You love America, as I do. You want an America strong and decent here at home. You want an America strong and at peace, with freedom, throughout the world. This country has restored trust in the White House in the last 2 years. This country has restored peace abroad. We should be proud of the fact that not a single young American is fighting and dying on any foreign soil tonight. And we're going to keep it that way. You should be proud that we have turned our economy around, that America sees brighter stars, skies, like you see in Oklahoma right here today. We're proud of that progress."", ""Now, let me give you a little straight talk about taxes, because if I could put a tax on empty rhetoric in this political year, we would have the national debt paid off in 1 week. When we talk about taxes, we're talking more than just about money. Every tax dollar represents your time, your energy, your hard work. Those tax dollars ought to work just as hard for you as you have worked for them."", ""Mr. Carter's platform calls for new Government programs that would cost between $100 billion and $200 billion each year. He never puts a price tag on those programs. He just says he will soak the rich, close the loopholes, and everything will be just fine."", ""Let me say this: If we put a 100 percent tax on all personal income over $50,000 in America, it would produce less than $9 billion a year. Where is the other $191 billion going to come from? Two choices: One, Mr. Carter can have a $191 billion deficit; two, he can do what he said he would do and raise taxes on every American family above the median income of $14,000, and we don't want that. I say to you there's a better way: Cut spending, cut taxes, keep more of your own money. To me, tax reform means tax reduction."", 'For 10 years now your Federal Government has been spending--spending has grown at an alarming rate, thanks to an overtaxing, overspending, overbearing Congress. The budget that I submitted to the Congress this year cut that rate of growth by one-half. I asked for a $28-billion tax cut. I asked for a $28-billion restraint on the growth of Federal spending so we could have an honest tax reduction. For every dollar we cut in spending, we could cut a dollar in taxes. Unfortunately, the Congress refused to make those reductions in spending. They went $18 billion more in the spending than I recommended. And the net result is they only cut the taxes of the American people $10 billion this year.', 'In January of next year, we""re going to do a lot better with a much better Congress. I will tell you the kinds of tax reductions I want. I asked for an increase in the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000 per person. That means that the middle-income taxpayer who has gotten short shrift, shortchanged by the Congress over the years will get the kind of tax reduction that the American people need and want. And that\'s what we stand for, and we\'re going to get it next year.', ""I asked for tax incentives to increase business investment in high unemployment areas. Congress refused. I sent back to the Congress 59 bills that I vetoed. I saved you more than $9 billion. If Mr. Carter's friends in the Congress had been more interested in saving rather than spending, we could have saved another $16 billion."", 'But let me say those vetoes did a lot of good. I thank those in the Congress who supported me. I appreciate the support from people like Henry Bellmon, Dewey Bartlett, John Jarman, Tom Steed. Those are the kind of people that have stood with you and stood with me in these tough decisions to save your hard-earned tax dollars.', 'But, let me say another word or two. One day Mr. Carter proposes doing away with tax deductions for home mortgage interest payments, for taxing church properties other than church buildings; the next day he says that wasn\'t what he really meant. One day Mr. Carter talks about balancing the Federal budget and fighting inflation; the next day he turns around and talks about new programs that would cost at least $100 billion annually. We have seen Mr. Carter go from labor halls and blast away at businessmen for paying less than their share of taxes and say their burden should be increased. Then he goes to Wall Street in New York City, the 21 Club, and tells businessmen, ""Don\'t worry, I didn\'t mean what I said."" We have seen Mr. Carter call for cuts of $15 billion in the defense budget, not once but twice--in Savannah, Georgia, March 15, 1975; in Beverly Hills, California, 5 days later. Then last Wednesday night we saw him deny it in San Francisco.', ""Mr. Carter can change his mind as often as he wants to--and he does it plenty of times--but he can't change the facts. He was wrong when he denied that he ever said we should slash, we should gut our defense budget by $15 billion. The American people asked Mr. Carter what are they supposed to believe. Mr. Carter replies, don't worry, I will tell you what I plan to do after November 2."", 'But let\'s talk about national defense. You have got a great national park here just a few miles away. A great American President, Teddy Roosevelt, once said, ""Speak softly and carry a big stick."" Mr. Carter speaks loudly and carries a flyswatter.', ""He wants to cut $15 billion out of your Army, your Navy, your Air Force, and Marine Corps. He wants to cancel or delay the B-1 bomber, which is aimed at replacing the B-52. The B-52's are about 20 years old, and by the time we phase in the B-1, they will be another 5 years older. But let me be very, very precise in this. President Ford doesn't believe in sending young pilots in planes in combat that are older than the pilots themselves. They deserve better than that from the American people."", 'Now, let me give you a little advice. If I were concerned about keeping America strong and Jimmy Carter were President, I would be worried sick. If I were concerned about inflation and high taxes and Jimmy Carter were President, I would be very, very worried. If I were concerned about bringing unemployment down without spending billions and billions on dead-end Humphrey-Hawkins jobs and Jimmy Carter were President, I would be very worried.', ""My friends, that is really what this campaign is all about. Mr. Carter and his platform offer more promises, more programs, more spending, more inflation, and more taxes. Jerry Ford says that government is already too large, too powerful, too costly, too remote, and too, too deeply involved in your lives. I want to make government your capable servant but not your meddling master. That's why I am a candidate for President in 1976."", 'Now let me make one final observation and comment. This country is strong, and this country is beautiful. But we ought to learn from past history. As we look around the world, one of our great and staunch allies over the years has been Great Britain. But Great Britain today is faced with the gravest financial crisis in its illustrious history.', 'Just earlier, a week ago, Prime Minister Callaghan had the courage to say as he spoke to his Labor Party Convention in England--and I quote him, because I think his words are what we ought to listen to. Prime Minister Callaghan had this to say, and I quote: ""Britain for too long has lived on borrowed time, borrowed money and borrowed ideas. We will fail if we think we can buy our way out of our present difficulties by printing confetti money and paying ourselves more than we earn."" Those are strong words by a man who leads a country whose past has been great but whose crisis is serious.', 'Let me say from the bottom of my heart that this country is strong, but we have those who are running for the Presidency who want to borrow more money, spend more money, have higher taxes, and lead us down the road to more and more inflation.', ""Let me say very specifically to each and every one of you, as long as Jerry Ford is President of the United States, we will not have that kind of a government. We will have a strong government at home with less taxes, less inflation, less Federal spending, and we will have a government that's strong enough to preserve the peace and to maintain our deterrent forces and to look at each other and say we're proud of America."", ""I come before you as a President who wants to serve you for the next 4 years, and to come back to Oklahoma, to Lawton, and say I have kept my promises.

Nowadays, government just tries to take it away from you, and we are going to stop it."", 'In the last few days I have had the privilege and honor of visiting San Francisco, Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, Universal City, and now Glendale. The weather gets better, and the welcome is warmer, and I thank you very, very much. But with this kind of welcome in Glendale, I know we are going to win California on November 2.', 'One of the most important issues in this campaign--especially here in California-is taxes. The people of California have already heard all four sides of the tax question. Unfortunately, three of them came from Jimmy Carter. Let me give you some examples.', 'First, back in February, Mr. Carter said he wanted to eliminate the home mortgage interest deduction on your Federal income tax. That was one of those loopholes he keeps talking about. Not long after that he said maybe he would not eliminate the deduction. As it stands now nobody is sure, least of all Mr. Carter.', ""Second, a few weeks ago Mr. Carter suggested he would raise income taxes for everyone over the median-income level, about $14,000 per year. Now he says that isn't what he meant. He says he has not studied the subject at all, but he will let us know what he decides after he has been in office for a few weeks. I say that is too late, and I say that very sincerely and very specifically. I say we should know--215 million Americans--before election what Mr. Carter plans to do about your taxes."", ""Third, Mr. Carter's platform calls for between $100 billion and $200 billion in new Federal spending. Yet, he talks about balancing the budget without raising anybody's taxes. He can't have it both ways. You know it, and I know it. He can't talk about compassion and not have compassion for the hard-working, middle-income taxpayers in this country."", 'The American people have a big heart, but too many politicians mistake that big heart for a blank check. It is not an act of compassion to rob older citizens of their fixed income by feeding inflation with more Federal spending. It is not an act of compassion to prevent a young couple from buying a home because Federal borrowing for deficit spending drives up interest rates. It is not an act of compassion to put coming generations of Americans deeply in debt and mortgage their futures before they are born.', 'You work hard for every dollar that you earn. Your tax dollars should work just as hard for you, and that is the way it will be under a Ford administration. You know who pays for every campaign promise. You know when the bills come due you get stuck with them.', ""In the last 2 years I vetoed 59 extravagant spending bills sent down to the Oval Office by an irresponsible Congress. My vetoes saved $9 billion. If Mr. Carter's friends in Congress had been as interested in saving money as I am, my vetoes could have saved $16 billion more. We hope for a better Congress with Carlos Moorhead and with Dr. Hayakawa representing you in the United States Senate."", 'My idea of tax reform is tax reduction--cut spending, cut taxes, keep more of your own money. For 10 years now Federal spending has grown at an alarming rate thanks to an overtaxing, overspending, overbearing Congress. The budget that I submitted to the Congress last January cut that rate of growth by one-half.', ""I asked for a $28 billion tax reduction and a $28 billion cut in Federal spending--a dollar of tax reduction for a dollar of a reduction in Federal spending. I asked for an increase in your personal exemption from $750 to $1,000. That's tax relief for the middle-income taxpayer of this country. They have been shortchanged by the kind of a Congress we have had for the last 22 years, and we have got to change that Congress so the middle-income taxpayer will get the kind of a tax reduction that they deserve. I asked for tax incentives to increase business investment in high employment areas. Congress refused."", ""Mr. Carter calls our tax system--he says it is a disgrace to the human race. If that's true, then it is a disgrace to the Democratic majorities who have controlled both the House and the Senate, written every tax law and every tax loophole for the past 22 years. You know where to put the blame."", 'The direction America takes in the next 4 years will be determined by the decision that you make on November 2. And let me use an illustration, if I might.', 'The crisis in Great Britain, a long and wonderful ally of the United States, tells us all we need to know about the danger of too much government, too much spending on borrowed money. The British pound, their currency, has sunk to its lowest level in all-time history. Inflation in Great Britain has been running at over 25 percent. Government spending now accounts for 60 percent of the entire British economy.', 'Listen to what Prime Minister Jim Callaghan of Great Britain, a courageous man who represents the head of that Government--he said, and I quote, ""We used to think that you could just spend your way out of a recession and increase employment by cutting taxes and boosting Government spending. I tell you in all candor,"" Prime Minister Callaghan said, ""that that option no longer exists and that insofar as it ever did exist, it worked by injecting inflation into our economy.""', 'He went on to say, ""And each time that that has happened, the average level of unemployment has risen. Higher inflation, followed by higher unemployment, that is the history of the last 20 years.""', 'And then the Prime Minister went on with another observation that I think is so pertinent in this political campaign. He said, ""Each time we did this the twin evils of unemployment and inflation have hit hardest those least able to stand them--the poor, the old, and the sick."" My friends, this is really what this campaign is all about.', 'Mr. Carter and his party platform offer more promises, more programs, more spending, more taxes, more inflation, and more unemployment, and we are not going to let that happen on November 2.', ""The unemployment figures for September came out this morning in Washington, D.C. Unemployment dropped by a tenth of a percent. We are moving in the right direction, but not with make-work jobs at the taxpayer's expense. We are moving in the right direction toward full employment by stimulating the private economy where five out of the six jobs exist in America."", 'Let me make one other additional comment. I have been talking about how we can strengthen our economy here at home. But it is equally important that we strengthen our capability to meet the challenge of any aggressors abroad.', 'How many of you remember a statement made by a former great President, Teddy Roosevelt, who said, ""Speak softly and carry a big stick""? Mr. Carter speaks loudly and wants to carry a flyswatter. Mr. Carter wants to cancel or cut back the B-1. He wants to keep our pilots flying the B-52\'s that are 20 to 25 years old today. I don\'t believe we should send a young pilot in a plane that is older than he is.', ""The best way I know to keep the peace is to be strong at home with an economy that meets the challenges that we must face, with a military capability that will meet every challenge from any source around the world. And you can't do that with the kind of a $15 billion cut in defense spending that Jimmy Carter wants to make. You'll weaken us in our challenges from those countries behind the Iron Curtain or the Bamboo Curtain."", ""But a military program that I stand for is one of strength so that we can negotiate with our adversaries from a position of strength. Don't buy the weak military program in this critical period that Mr. Carter wants to foist upon the American people. It is wrong for America, and don't stand for it."", 'Let me conclude by saying that Jerry Ford says that government is already too large, too powerful, too costly, too remote, and too deeply involved in your daily lives. I want to make government your capable servant but not your meddling master. That is why I am a candidate for the Presidency on November 2.', ""As Glendale celebrates its proud past, I ask you to think about your children's future and your country's future. I ask for your help on that fateful day of November 2. I ask for your support, your vote."", ""And let me conclude by saying: Jerry Ford hasn't and won't let you down."", 'Thank you very much.']"

On our carrier, we not only had plenty of native Texans but a lot of men who trained here in the State of Texas and are probably Texans now. We did everything on that ship except fly the Lone Star battle flag."", 'When I first went to Congress, I learned the ropes from legislative giants like Mr. Sam Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson. I made good friends like George Mahon, George Bush, John Tower, and Tiger Teague, among others from your great State.', ""What always impressed me the most was the way Texans put their country above their political party when America's fundamental interests were at stake. I saw them time and again rally around the President, whoever he might be, when he was dealing in the high stakes of peace and war."", ""The corroboration and support that Speaker Sam Rayburn and Senator Lyndon Johnson gave to President Eisenhower when he was Commander in Chief became my example when President Johnson faced those same tough calls on foreign policy and national security. And although we had our differences, Lyndon Johnson never distorted the truth when discussing the tough issues affecting America's strength."", ""In the coming weeks and future years, I really hope that this bipartisan tradition of responsibility and unity beyond the water's edge can survive in American politics. It's an important part of our national strength, as Texans taught me."", ""You never heard a Texan tell the world our country is not strong anymore. You never heard a Texan proclaim that America is not respected anymore. You never heard a Texan allege that the American people have lost their pride in America's strength and its moral integrity."", 'It isn\'t only the ""eyes of Texas"" that are upon us. The eyes of the whole world are on the United States of America this year, not just for the Fourth of July when we celebrated a glorious 200th anniversary, but also on November 2. We\'re on display as much as all the entries in this great Texas State Fair.', ""We have been the world champion of liberty and self-government for the last 200 years. We are proud of our trophies. We are proud of our material strength and even more of America's moral strength. We are respected for all of these and many other things. Let's get our third century off to a good start, scrapping over the little things, but standing together tall and strong on the big things that affect us at home and abroad--big things like peace through strength, peace with freedom. That's the spirit that made Texas great, that made America great. That's the spirit we can show the world in 1976."", 'Thank you very much.']"

It is a great privilege and a very high honor to have the opportunity of being in Brooklyn with Senator Javits and Senator Buckley and to have an opportunity to thank you all for the very warm reception. Over the years I have had many, many opportunities to come to this great city and know intimately many of the fine people in Brooklyn, New York City.', ""We have a great country. We must keep strong within our country by making certain that we spend your tax dollars in a responsible and a proper way. We must make certain that we find the best way, the fairest way for the Federal Government to tax all of you. I happen to believe very strongly that the middle-income taxpayer of this country has been shortchanged and that the middle-income taxpayer needs a tax reduction in the way that I proposed by increasing the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000. And we're going to get it in the next session of Congress."", 'But it is also important that we find the best answer to making America prosperous again. And we can do that by the right tax policies that give more tax reduction to the taxpayers and hold a reasonable restraint on the expenditure of Federal funds.', 'Let me say this: I will never be satisfied until everybody who wants to work can find a job, period.', 'Let me in conclusion make this observation. America is strong; America is secure. There is not a single young American boy fighting or dying on foreign soil today. We are at peace, and we should be proud of it. We have the military capability and the diplomatic skill to keep the peace.', 'So, I pledge to each and every one of you that we will have a strong and prosperous economy. We will have a peace that is secure. And you can trust your President, who has restored trust in the White House.Thank you very, very much.', 'BAY RIDGE (3 p.m.)', 'Let me say just a few words. I think we can say with pride, we can say with the fullest, complete conviction, that we are doing the right thing for this country. I am the first President in 20 years who can go before the American people and say that our Nation is at peace. There is not a single young American fighting or dying on any foreign soil today, and we should be proud of it. And we have the military capability and the diplomatic skills to keep the peace, and you will under a Ford administration.', 'But we have to have a healthy economy at home, and that means a job for everybody who wants a job; it means a home for everybody who will work for it and save for it. And that means we have to get rid of the crime on the streets so that you and your children will be free of any terrorism, either at home or abroad. It means that you have to have the best education, the kind of health care that you need and that you can afford.', 'So, we want only good health, good education, a better tax system, responsible action in meeting the problems of crime, equality of life in America.', ""Let me conclude by one final comment. I think the middle-income taxpayer in this country is getting shortchanged, and the best way to give him the right kind of tax relief is to increase the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000. That's what we need and that's what we'll get."", 'Thank you all very much.', ""[At this point, the President's motorcade proceeded from 82d Street and Fifth Avenue to 84th Street and Fifth Avenue, where the President spoke as follows:]"", 'Hi, how are you? Nice to see you.', 'Let me make one or two comments. I am delighted to be here in this wonderful community with Senator Jack Javits and Senator Jim Buckley. Give them a big hand.', 'Let me say very quickly, what do we want in America? We want peace, and we want prosperity, and we want trust. Under your President, Jerry Ford has restored trust in the White House. You can now believe what you hear out of the White House.', ""Number two, America is at peace. There is not a single young American fighting and dying on foreign soil today, and we're going to keep it that way."", 'But we want to give a better quality of life right here in America. What we want is a job for everybody who wants to work, and we will get him a job. We want a home for everybody who will work and save for it, and we are going to get that under the next 4 years. We want to be certain that you can walk down this street or that street and be safe, and we are going to take care of the crime problem in America, period.', ""We want these young people that I have seen on both sides of the street-we want them to get an education so that they can not only have an education but one that will do them good when they get old enough and want a job. And we're going to get that in the education system."", 'But let me just conclude with this observation. November 2 is a critical testing point for America. It you want a country that is strong at home, strong abroad, and with peace and prosperity, vote for Jerry Ford. I ask for your support.', 'Thank you.']"

And I am especially appreciative of the student body of Archbishop Stepinac.', ""But may I add one other comment. I had a wonderful day in the State of New York yesterday, in Flatbush and Brooklyn and Manhattan, and we have had a superb day so far in Yonkers and White Plains. But it's been made especially meaningful to me because I have had with me your two outstanding United States Senators--Senator Jack Javits and Senator Jim Buckley. But I have also been privileged to have the various Members of Congress who represent the various areas in the State of New York that I have been privileged to visit in this day and a half so far. They are quality people. Send them back, and give me some help by getting some more good people like that."", 'Mayor Delveccio said that White Plains has a great, wonderful, historical background. I was looking just the other day, in contemplation of coming to White Plains, that 200 years ago this month, young Americans fought the British Redcoats right in the Battle of White Plains.', ""In 1976 a different kind of battle is raging the length and the breadth of this country. In this battle the citizens of White Plains and all Americans are not fighting Redcoats but red tape and red ink, and we are going to win that battle, too. That's the basic difference between Plains, Georgia, and White Plains, New York."", ""My opponent from Plains, Georgia, makes the promises. You here in White Plains, New York, would have to pay for them, and you don't want to, so let's win this battle November 2."", ""One of the most important issues in this campaign is taxes. You have heard over the last few months all four sides of the same question, three of them from Mr. Carter. As a matter of fact, the liveliest debate of this campaign has been the debate between Jimmy Carter and Jimmy Carter. He says he's for a balanced budget, but he refuses to support the 60 vetoes that have saved the American taxpayer $9-plus billion. He says America is weak militarily, but he wants to cut the defense budget by $15 billion. Jimmy Carter says he's against inflation, but he supports the Democratic platform with $100 billion to $200 billion in new spending. He can't have it both ways, and we're not going to let him have it both ways."", ""He says he's for tax reform, but he reneged on his promise to provide specifics before the election. He says he's for higher taxes for people earning over $14,000 a year. But I say--and listen carefully--I say the middle-income taxpayer is already overtaxed, overburdened, and underrepresented."", 'Jimmy Carter says he wants to tax the churches except on their church property. I am opposed to that, and I know you are.', 'I have been told few things upset New Yorkers as much as your skyrocketing taxes. I think that bothers people all over the country. The way to reverse that trend is not to expand Government spending but to cut it back. And thanks to my 60 vetoes, you know which candidate for President stands for cutting back expenditures, holding the line, and reducing your taxes--it is Jerry Ford.', ""Property taxes all over the country are climbing. But let me add this: They would climb a lot faster if we didn't have general revenue sharing, which I just signed into law in the city of Yonkers. Revenue sharing is the kind of a specific program to help all of you, to encourage all of you to solve your problems at the local level."", 'Let me tell you something that some of you may have forgotten. Last February, Jimmy Carter came out in favor of eliminating the deduction for mortgage interest on your Federal income tax return. Obviously, when the American people rebelled, he retreated back into the same old generalities.', ""Well, there's no such confusion about my stand on that deduction of mortgage interest. Jerry Ford supports that deduction. I did for 25 years in the House of Representatives, and I will do it for the next 4 years as President of the United States. I'm not going to let homeowners become the next endangered species. Jimmy Carter would."", ""To me, tax reform means tax reduction. Nine days ago, I signed into law a tax bill which extended the cuts that I recommended last year. But the Tax Reform Act of 1976 fails to include some other suggestions that I have proposed to give the proper kind of tax relief that the taxpayers deserve. For example, I recommended that we increase the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000. That's a meaningful tax return to the middle-income taxpayer, and we're going to get it next year if we didn't get it this year."", ""You know we've heard a lot of talk in this campaign about compassion. Our Government must always show compassion toward the truly needy. The time has come, as I see it, to show as much compassion toward the people who make the generosity of Federal Government programs possible in the first place. But let me add this great, big, important, extra comment: How about a lot of compassion for the American taxpayer? That is what Jerry Ford stands for."", 'The people of White Plains work hard for every dollar that you make. You are the people who get up early every day, go to bed fired every night--quietly building a better life for your families and your fellow citizens. You pay the taxes, you obey the laws, you are the people who make possible the good things that government does.', ""So, when a Federal spending bill reaches my desk, I keep each and every one of you in mind. It may be congressional compassion, but it is your money. And that's why I have vetoed 60 bills sent down to the Oval Office from Capitol Hill, because they want to spend and spend and spend, and Jimmy Carter wants to spend and spend and spend. And I'm going to be there to be compassionate about your tax dollar, period."", 'The American people cannot afford to have leaders who try to be all things to all people. The President of the United States must be the same thing to all people.', ""When voters look at the record of the last 2 years, they will see that the United States has made an incredible comeback. Today, we are on the steady road to peace, prosperity, and trust. But on November 2 we'll reach a fork in that road. We can continue the policies and the leadership that have brought us back from a national nightmare, back from recession, back from international conflict, or we can take instead the same old path that leads to bigger government, higher taxes, and more inflation and more unemployment."", ""The choice to each and every one of you voters in this great State of New York, that's your choice. Through 2 difficult years, I have stood for the little taxpayer against the big tax spender. It's from your ranks that I come and on your side that I stand. On November 2, I ask that each and every one of you stand with me. I would appreciate your help.""]"

The American people won't let him get away with it, and you in Paramus won't let him get away with it."", ""I think you in New Jersey know how risky it is when a candidate says one thing on the campaign trail and then does something else when he gets in public office.

Send them down to Washington.', 'Let me conclude with this observation and comment. We have heard a lot--a great deal, I might say--about trust in this campaign. But it is not enough for anybody to say trust me. Trust must be earned. Trust is not guessing what a candidate means; trust is leveling with the American people before the election about what you are going to do after the election.

Do you want your taxes raised so you can pay for those hundred billion dollar programs of Jimmy Carter? I think I heard that loud and clear.', 'Let me talk for just a minute about taxes. You know where I stand. I recommended last year a $28 billion tax reduction which included a tax reduction of the personal income exemption, increasing that exemption from $750 to $1,000.

The United States represents leadership throughout the world. We are at peace today. Not a single young American is fighting or dying on a foreign battlefield today because we are strong, and we are going to stay that way.

The Ford administration stands shoulder to shoulder with the State of Israel. We believe in its security and survival and independence.', ""But let me conclude with just this final observation. I have been your President for 2 years. Let's look at the record. Inflation is half of what it was when I became President. More Americans are working today than at any time in the history of the United States, but Jerry Ford won't be satisfied until every American who wants a job has a job, period.

I believe that in the last 24 months, we have restored that trust that is essential in the Oval Office.

We are all proud of you wherever we come from in the United States of America. This record corn crop is a graphic illustration of an overriding nonpolitical fact that transcends all the noise, the rhetoric of this election year. America is blessed with farmlands and farm know-how unequaled anyplace on this Earth.

We did it without any Government board selling your exports, as some countries do. And under a Ford administration, we will never have that kind of arbitrary action--a Government board selling your hard work, hard-earned products from your farms. We did it without any international reserve where this country could be outvoted 100 to 1.', ""We have worked out a long-term agreement, as all of you know, with the Soviet Union, which commits them to buy at least 6 million metric tons of grain every year for the next 5 years. In dollars and cents, that's at least $1 billion worth of grain sales every 12 months. This agreement gives us a stable, long-term foreign market. It assures us of a more consistent flow of payments from abroad. It assures the American farmer that the Soviet Union will be a steady customer whether they have good crops or bad."", ""In the past, Soviet grain purchases have been erratic, secretive, unpredictable, causing prices to fluctuate widely, leaving the American farmer on the short end. The Soviets have already bought over 6 1/2 million metric tons of wheat and corn for the first year of this agreement. To date, we have sold the Soviet Union more than 8 million metric tons of grain and soybeans from this year's crop. By this arrangement the private marketing system has not only been preserved but it has been strengthened."", ""We are moving in the right direction toward greater prosperity for the American farmer, and we will keep moving in that direction in the next 4 years.

In an interview published on August 8, 1976, Mr. Carter was asked, would you favor using our economic leverage to get the Russians to cease and desist from aggressive actions? Mr. Carter replied, ""Yes, I would."" In our second debate, he told 90 million Americans that a new Arab oil embargo would amount to an economic declaration of war and that he would instantly respond with a total embargo against the offending country, shipping them nothing, including food. Those are the things he said about his plans for your products in the future.', 'But more important is what Mr. Carter didn\'t say. When he made his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention in New York City there was no mention of farm policy, not once in 40 minutes. At the Republican Convention, I said, ""We will carry out a farm policy that assures a fair market price for the farmer, encourages full production, leads to record exports and eases the hunger within the human family."" I think you like my comments better than his. That is a pledge that I was proud to make, a pledge that I will proudly carry out for the next 4 years.', ""Despite the good overall record I mentioned earlier, some farmers--yes, too many--are having a hard time of it right now. Cattle prices are way too low. Wheat prices are too low. The weather has not been a very good friend to a lot of farmers in Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, Minnesota, and other parts of our great country. I've already done something about the cattle situation. I tried earlier this year to halt the importation of foreign beef through a free trade zone in Puerto Rico. Diplomatic, administrative, and legal roadblocks prevented us from carrying out what I wanted to do to help the cattle producer. I then went to the Congress, which failed to act on my request to curb these imports."", 'Therefore, last week in Dallas, Texas, I signed a Presidential proclamation [4469] to limit beef imports and thereby help the American beef industry. I have repeatedly said that I would not under any circumstances permit the United States to become a dumping grounds for foreign beef.', ""I've already done something about Government loan rates for grains. On Wednesday, I ordered an increase in the Government loan rates for wheat from $1.50 to $2.25 a bushel; for corn, from $1.25 to $1.50. These adjustments, as you know far better than I, will permit the bumper crops to be marketed in a much more orderly way, and will help farmers to properly .finance next year's plantings."", ""And I've also done something about the great tradition of the American family farm. Earlier this year I called upon the Congress to increase the Federal estate tax exemption. I fought hard for it and was proud to sign it into law a few days ago. This increases the estate tax exemption from $60,000 to the equivalent of $175,000. This new law also permits estate tax payments on family farms to be stretched out over an extended period. These tax reforms will go a long, long way to help save the family farm from the Federal tax collector."", ""But I must add one other comment. Congress failed to go along with my proposal to permit tax exempt transfers from spouse to spouse, but next year I'm going to put the pressure on the Congress and will keep it there until they do something about this situation."", ""I'm also trying to do something about the drought. [Laughter] I've just signed legislation authorizing the establishment, for the first time in American history, of a national policy to develop new methods of combating the crippling drought conditions that have cut farm production far too frequently. Under this new program, the Commerce Department will conduct research and develop means of modifying the effects of severe weather changes to protect the farmer."", ""This new program, with some extra funding, is in addition to the increases that I approved for other agriculture research and development in this year's budget at a time when we were faced with serious financial problems in the Federal Government, at a time when I kept the lid on, or actually cut back a number of Federal programs. But agricultural research has produced wonders for America and the world, and we must continue making sound investment in research and development in agriculture in the future for us and those around the world."", ""Those are some of the things that our Government can and should do to help you. The Government should never try to dictate how farmers should farm. I have faith in the ability of America's farmers to make their own decisions, to determine what and how much they will plant. As long as I am your President, agriculture will have an understanding friend in the White House in the Nation's Capital."", ""Of course, Mr. Carter says he's a farmer's friend, too. But what kind of a friend is he? Mr. Carter wants to go back to the old discredited Government meddling in the farmer's affairs. He wants to build up a stockpile of farm surpluses once again. He has proposed a stockpile of 25 million metric tons of grain with half of it to be held in Government bins."", ""His underlying philosophy of Government interference won't change. His philosophy is best exemplified by the Humphrey-Hawkins bill, embraced by Mr. Carter, which envisions export controls and licensing unprecedented in peacetime economy."", 'Mr. Carter does have a strange way of changing his accent as he moves about this great country. [Laughter] In California, he tries to sound like Cesar Chavez. In Chicago, he sounds like Mayor Daley. In New York, he sounds like Ralph Nader. In Washington, D.C., he sounds like George Meany. Then Mr. Carter comes to the farm belt. He becomes a little old peanut farmer. [Laughter]', ""The President has to take the same position wherever he goes, and that's the kind of a President I've been and will continue to be for the next 4 years."", 'When the Agriculture Department was created by Abraham Lincoln in 1862, its motto was ""Agriculture is the foundation of manufacturing and commerce."" It was true then; it is true today. The farmer is the mainspring of the American economy. U.S. farm exports have provided the foundation for our economic recovery, which is now underway. It has taken mankind countless centuries to reach a worldwide population of 4 billion, but just 35 years from now there will probably be 4 billion more people living on this Earth.', 'We initiated a World Food Conference in Rome in 1974, and one of our delegates at that time was Senator Bob Dole, who will be the next Vice President of the United States. At that Conference, experts concluded that the United States, Canada, and Australia combined--the three biggest food-exporting countries in the world--could not hope to meet the food demands of the world if the population doubled in that short a time. Yet we must. The American farmer can do anything he sets out to do if the Government will just leave him alone.', ""The Ford administration and the American farmer share the same ideals, the same confident approach to the future, the same belief in our land, and the same concern for the undernourished and starving millions throughout the world. You and I together stand for hard, productive work, for honesty, straight talk, and basic morality. You and I together stand for lean, responsive, fiscally sound government. And you and I together, working for the next 4 years, can make this great country better and better and better. Let's do it."", 'We believe in a minimum of bureaucratic control over farming. We believe in agricultural policies geared to a free market economy. We believe that the farmer himself should decide how to use his land, his capital, and his labor for a profit.', ""We don't believe that profit should be capriciously taxed away from him or his family. The choice is clear. Government is already too large, too powerful, too costly, and too deeply involved in the lives of every American. Mr. Carter cannot carry out his promises without bigger bureaucracies and higher taxes."", 'I want a new generation of freedom in America, freedom for all of us to do what we want to do and what we ought to do. The kind of an America you want and I want is an abundant America, one of record farm income, record crops, record exports, and record acreage back into production, and freedom for the farmer to make his own decisions and to reap the rewards of his hard labor.', 'I have come here today to ask for your support and for your vote on November 2.

That's a real, meaningful, important tax reduction, and that's what we stand for."", ""What does Jimmy Carter want to do with your taxes? Jimmy Carter says he will increase taxes for all people with a median income and on up, which means that anybody who's earning $14,000 a year or more is going to have his taxes increased under Jimmy Carter.

He can't have it both ways."", 'There was a great, great President a few years ago named Teddy Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt once said, ""Speak softly and carry a big stick.""

The Prime Minister of Ireland said, ""It isn\'t""--he said, ""The ties that were forged between us are today stronger and firmer than ever.""', 'President Giscard of France said, and I quote, ""I do not think there has ever been a time when contacts between our two Governments have been more frequent, consultation more sustained, and cooperation more goodwilled.""', 'And then the Chancellor of the Government of West Germany said, ""At no time during the past 30 years have relations between our countries been closer and cooperation more trustful and direct than today.""', ""Jimmy Carter doesn't know what he's talking about.

Since I have been President, we have turned the economy around, and the United States today is on a surge toward the kind of prosperity that we expect and will have in the 4 years under President Ford.

And I am proud to say that not a single young American is fighting or dying on any foreign soil under this administration.', ""One other very important point--taxes, spending, national security. Jerry Ford believes the best tax reform is tax reduction, and that's why I recommended to the Congress that they increase your personal exemption from $750 per person to $1,000.

President Ford wants to reduce the middle-income taxpayers' obligations to the Federal Government. Jimmy Carter says he will increase them. So when you go to that ballot box, think about how you can get a fair shake in the Federal tax payments that you have to make."", ""One other point: I think we've got to put the lid on Federal spending. Jimmy Carter has embraced 60-some spending programs that will add $100 billion to $200 billion annually to the Federal expenditure."", ""Jimmy Carter also says he wants to reorganize the Federal Government.

Now, he can't have it both ways."", 'And let me remind you of a statement made by a great President of the United States, Teddy Roosevelt, who once said, ""Speak softly and carry a big stick.""

The Governor denied that he had advocated eliminating the deduction for homeowners' interest payments. I pointed out to the Governor in my telegram that last February--last February, 1976--in a debate sponsored by the League of Women Voters, he stated that he would advocate eliminating the tax deduction for interest paid on home mortgages. President Ford is against the elimination of that deduction for homeowners on their mortgage payments."", 'Governor Carter denied that his new spending program would cost $100 billion annually. I pointed out to him in my telegram that the spending programs proposed in the Democratic platform that Governor Carter helped to write would probably cost close to $200 billion annually.

The only way to hold down the cost of living is to hold down the cost of Government. I would much rather give tax cuts to the American people than to think up new ways to have the Federal Government spend your hard-earned tax dollars.', 'Governor Carter, in the telegram to me, stated that he had not called for a $15 billion reduction in the defense budget. I pointed out in my telegram to him that in March of 1975, in Savannah, Georgia, and again in a press conference in Los Angeles, California, he called for a $15 billion reduction in the defense budget.', ""I firmly believe that it's in our national interest, I strongly believe that in order to keep peace throughout the world, the United States must remain number one.

First, does he really believe, as he said in an interview with Liberty Magazine, that church property should be taxed? Number two, does he agree with his own economic adviser that his economic programs would lead to additional inflation? Does he really believe that our Nation is not strong enough? Does he really believe, as he stated in San Francisco, that America is no longer respected?

That's a good record."", ""So, in the last 2 years plus, we have restored trust in the White House. We are on the road to real prosperity, and we have peace. That's a record of performance. I lay that alongside of the promises made by Jimmy Carter. It seems to me that Jimmy Carter will say anything, anywhere to get to be President of the United States. When Jimmy Carter is in California, he sounds like he is trying to be Cesar Chavez. When Jimmy Carter is in Chicago, he tries to sound like Mayor Daley. When Jimmy Carter is in New York, he tries to sound like Bella Abzug. But when Jimmy Carter comes down to Illinois, downstate, Jimmy Carter tries to tell you he is just a little old peanut farmer.

That would be good, sound tax relief, tax reduction, for the middle-income taxpayer who has been shortchanged by the Democratic Congress. Jimmy Carter--he wants to increase taxes for the individuals who will go from the median income on up. That means that under Jimmy Carter's platform, Jimmy Carter will increase the taxes of 50 percent of the Federal taxpayers in America."", ""Let me tell you, if you like Jimmy Carter, you like taxes. I think you prefer Jerry Ford, who wants to reduce your middle-income taxes. A big issue, a major difference between Jimmy Carter and myself--I think we've got to keep a lid on Federal spending. I think the Federal Government has to pull in its belt and stop spending your money as recklessly as we have."", ""Jimmy Carter embraces the Democratic platform, which calls for 60 new programs that will spend a minimum of $100 billion more each year. And if you cost them all out, it will probably cost you $200 billion more a year. I don't think the American people want that kind of spending, which means more inflation and more taxes."", ""But Jimmy says, well, he's going to reorganize the Federal Government. Jimmy Carter, when he was Governor of the State of Georgia, told the people of Georgia the same thing. What happened? Well, in 4 years, he increased the number of State employees by over 25 percent, he increased the spending by over 50 percent, and he added to the bonded indebtedness of Georgia by $200 million."", ""Well, with that kind of record in Georgia, I think it would be catastrophic if he tried to do the same thing with the Federal Government. I don't think you want that kind of reorganization. I think you want a Federal Government that is responsive and responsible to the American people. And under the Ford administration we are going to give you that."", ""Now, Jimmy Carter on two occasions--once in Savannah, Georgia and once in Los Angeles--said that the Defense Department ought to be cut by $15 billion. He denied it, but the facts are that's what he said. On the other hand, Jimmy Carter says America isn't strong enough. Now, you can't cut the defense budget by $15 billion and keep the United States number one.

I know in this area-this is part of that great breadbasket of America. I know that you have produced corn and soybeans and wheat. I know that you are a great contributor to the bounty of America. If you look at the farm policy of this administration against the promised farm policies of Jimmy Carter--I believe in expanded production, record exports, the use of the free market.

The American people decided we had a good convention, we had a good platform, we were pulling together, and we had the right vision and the right programs for the American people.

There will be a home in a decent neighborhood for every person or couple that wants to work and save and buy a home. It's the direction of security on the streets for our young as well as our old, against crime in America. It means giving to the American people the best medical care available at affordable prices. It means greater opportunities for recreation in the wonderful, scenic places we have all over America. It means that the American people can live in a society where there has been healing, not division; where we can disagree without being disagreeable; where we can look forward in the next 4 years and far beyond to a quality of life, peace abroad and peace at home, with prosperity for all.

And I thank you for the wonderfully warm and hospitable welcome."", ""In Kansas City, I promised not to concede a single vote or a single State. I meant it. And let me give you where I've been to prove the point. Some people have said, well, I've been spending my time in the Rose Garden. Some people have been saying I've been hiding out. Well, here is the itinerary."", ""Today, I was in Virginia, now in North Carolina, later in South Carolina; last week, in Oklahoma, Texas; the week before, in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. I don't think that's hiding out in Washington, D.C."", ""A couple of weeks ago I opened the State Fair in Texas, but Jim Holshouser told me if I wanted to see a really big fair, I'd have to come to North Carolina. I'm here, and I love it. Thank you."", ""While I am here, let me extend a very special invitation to come to Washington next January for the inauguration of Jerry Ford and Bob Dole; or to put it another way, y'all come. [Laughter]"", ""In Kansas City, I knew I had picked an outstanding teammate or running mate. Bob Dole has a superb record, not only in the House of Representatives but in the United States Senate. But I didn't really understand that I got such a big dividend when we got Liddy Dole with Bob Dole, and thank you very much."", 'Let me express my deepest appreciation to your outstanding United States Senator Jesse Helms, and the two fine Congressmen that I know so well, Jim Broyhill and Jim Martin. Lets add a few more just like them on Election Day.', ""Over the years, I've developed a very close and warm friendship with the people of this State, dating back--I went to law school here one summer at the University of North Carolina, I spent a few months in Chapel Hill--assigned there by the Navy in World War II. [Laughter] My oldest son, Mike, and his wonderful wife, Gayle, graduated from Wake Forest and, of course, as I mentioned earlier, were delighted to have that wonderful Southern accent, that beautiful gal, Elizabeth Hanford Dole, from Salisbury, North Carolina."", 'But let me talk very straight to you for a few minutes. You know where I stand. I stand on your side for limited government, for fiscal responsibility, for rising prosperity, for lower taxes, for military strength, and for peace in the world. Not a single young American is fighting or dying on any foreign soil today, and I intend to keep it that way.', ""After so many years in which America's defensive needs were shortchanged, I proposed the two largest military budgets in America's history, and I was able to convince the Congress to stop slashing away at military spending."", ""After so many years of runaway growth in the Federal budget, I submitted a budget for this fiscal year which cut the rate of growth in Federal spending in half. I have held the line on Government spending with 64 vetoes and saved you, the hard-pressed taxpayers, $9 billion. Because I've not been afraid to say no to excessive spending, we will be able to submit a balanced Federal budget by 1978; and, in addition, we'll have another tax reduction for the American taxpayer, particularly the middle-income taxpayers of this country."", ""My idea of tax reform is tax reduction. I'm sure you recall that I submitted to the Congress a proposal to increase the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000. That is meaningful tax reduction to the long shortchanged middle-income taxpayers. Congress didn't pass it, but I make a pledge to you: I'm going to keep the pressure on the next Congress until they do, and if they don't, they'll hear about it in the next election."", ""After so many years of uncontrolled inflation, we have cut the rate of inflation by better than 50 percent. We'll do even better in the future. After the worst economic recession in 40 years, we have added 40 million jobs to the American economy in the last 18 months, not by creating dead end jobs at the taxpayer's expense; we've added these 4 million jobs by stimulating the private economy, where five out of the six jobs are in America today."", ""Too many people are still out of work. We are not satisfied with the progress we've made, but more Americans were on the job in 1976 than ever before in the history of the United States, nearly 88 million. And that's a tremendous comeback from where we were just a year and a half ago."", ""After suffering a tragic betrayal of public trust 2 years ago, America has had its faith restored in the White House. My administration has been open, candid, straightforward, and we'll keep it that way for the next 4 years. As I told the Southern Baptist Convention in Norfolk earlier this year, I firmly believe that private morality and public service can and must go hand in hand."", ""I mentioned only a part of the Ford administration's record in the past 2 years, but let me add just a few more. Farm exports and farm income are at an all-time high. A major effort is already underway to cut red tape in the Federal bureaucracy. We are working for peace and justice in the Middle East and throughout the world. In every field, America is on the move, on the march."", ""We made an incredible comeback in the past 2 years, and we're not through yet. You can believe me when I tell you that America is strong and will be kept strong, because the American people are willing to pay for that kind of national security."", 'You can believe me when I say this Nation is sound, this Nation is secure, this Nation is on the way to a better quality of life for all Americans, and this administration has earned the trust of the American people for the next 4 years.', ""My record is one of progress, not platitudes; performance, not promises. We don't need government to do everything for us or to tell us everything we can or cannot do."", ""We have a great reservoir of talented industry in this country, and it's not all concentrated on the banks of the Potomac River. You've got it here in North Carolina; it exists all over America. That's where the progress will come as we move ahead in our third century in the United States. More often you will find it on the banks of the Neuse River here in Raleigh or on the beautiful New River we helped to save in the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina, or on the Outer Banks down east."", ""Let me say I was deeply grateful to your great Governor, Jim Holshouser, for listing some of the things that this administration has done in working with his administration. The relationship between your Governor and myself is a close one, and I can say--because I know a few Governors around the country--in Jim Holshouser you've got one of the best, and you should be proud of him."", ""Having spent as much time as I have during my life in the great Tarheel State, I think I know something about the way the people in North Carolina feel. I don't think you here in North Carolina are ready to see our free economy bogged down with even more rules, regulations, red tape, and red ink. And I hope you will register your opinion loud and clear on November 2."", 'This great State Fair is a good example of what people can do by themselves. We have the most productive farmers in the history of mankind. One American farmer today feeds 56 other people. The farmers of North Carolina, as Jim Holshouser said, will bring in their highest income from their tobacco crop in 1976. I compliment you for it. We are proud of that productivity.', ""I want to preserve the family farm in North Carolina, and throughout America. I've been fighting all year to revise the estate tax laws to ensure that you won't have to sacrifice your farms just to pay the Federal tax collector."", 'I recommended this increase in the personal exemption in the estate tax from $60,000 to a higher figure. The Congress finally passed it, and I was pleased that they raised, on my recommendation, the tax exemption from $60,000 to something like $175,000 and stretched out the payments on those estate taxes. This is constructive legislation, because the family farm means so much to the people of North Carolina as well as in the other 49 States.', 'For those who want to own a home in rural America, I am announcing today that I have directed the Department of Agriculture to raise the moderate income limit for rural housing loans from $12,900 to $15,600. This change, coupled with the recent increase in the low-income limit from $8,500 to $10,000, and lowering the interest rate to 8 percent, will greatly increase our ability to help rural families buy a home of their own, and a home is the most important factor in building a strong America.', 'But rural vitality is not all that North Carolina has going for it. The North Carolina Research Triangle and the other fine colleges and universities in this wonderful State have helped make America the most advanced technological and educational society in the history of mankind.', 'Just this week, America made a clean sweep in the Nobel Prizes for economics, chemistry, physics, medicine, and literature. This is the first time in history that a single country has been the home of all of these winners. I am proud to be a citizen of the great United States of America, and you and I can be proud of what has been done, and we can be proud of the progress we are going to make in the future.', ""We have our problems, but in the last 2 troubled years we've come a long, long way. Our long national nightmare is over; 4 million new jobs have been created in less than 2 years; inflation cut more than half; trust has been restored in the White House; America is at peace. at home as well as abroad; we are putting our old angers aside; we are putting our old problems behind us and healing our wounds."", 'It is a record I am proud to run on, a record of the people of North Carolina and concerned citizens--Democrats, Independents, and Republicans--throughout America will support on November 2. Give me your mandate, and we will reduce the growth of government still more. Give me your mandate, and we will ensure the integrity of the social security system. We will improve Medicare so that our older citizens can enjoy the health and happiness that they have so richly earned. There is no reason that they should have to go broke just to get well.', 'Give me your mandate, and we will make sure that this rich and wonderful Nation does not neglect its citizens who are less fortunate than ourselves, but provides for their needs with compassion and with dignity. Give me your mandate, and we will create a tax structure that is fair to all, that will preserve the family home, the family business, the family farm, and give industry in America the opportunity to modernize, to expand, so that we can create more jobs for the young who are coming into the labor market.', 'Give me your mandate, and we will expand the recreational opportunities and restore the healthy environment of this great country so that we can leave a legacy to future generations of America. Give me your mandate, and I will lead this Nation on the paths of peace through strength, and we will live in peace and freedom in the United States of America.', 'I have no fear for the future of America. The future is our friend, and as we go forward together, I promise you once more--as I have promised you before-to uphold the Constitution, to do what is right as God gives me to see the right, and to do the very best that I can for America. God helping me, I will not let you down.', 'Thank you very much.']"
119,Gerald R. Ford ,"October 23, 1976","['Thank you very, very much, Governor Godwin. It is a very high honor and a very great privilege for me to be in this great State capital and have the kind and very generous observations and compliments by your great Governor, Mills Godwin.', ""May I say it's a pleasure, also, to be on the platform with Congressman Ken Robinson, Lieutenant Governor Dalton, and my old and very dear friend--who I served with in the Congress of the United States for many, many years--former Governor Tuck."", ""Distinguished officials, ladies and gentlemen: At Kansas City, I said that I would not concede a single State, I would not concede a single vote; that I would campaign from the snowy banks of Minnesota to the sandy plains of Georgia. I've kept that pledge--just today, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, ending up in California. So, let me say without any hesitation or reservation, we are going to see as many people as we can to keep that pledge that I would not concede a single vote or a single State."", 'I had, last night, one of the greatest honors--to spend the night with Governor Mills Godwin and his lovely wife, Catherine. Back in the days when Governor Godwin was a Democratic Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, I envied him, I respected him, and I had a long hope that some day we could be together. And let me say very, very strongly that Governor Mills Godwin is one of the giants of American politics, and we are proud of him.', ""But I'm also proud to say that Virginia is the second home of the Ford family. We lived in Alexandria for some 25 years before we moved into the White House. In fact, for the first few days after taking the oath of office on August 9, 1974, we lived in our home in Alexandria and actually commuted to the White House and to the Oval Office. So one could honestly say, for a limited period of time, Virginia was the White House for the United States."", 'Our four children went to the public schools in Alexandria. I paid taxes in the State of Virginia. I even belong to the Friendship Veterans Fire Engine Company in Alexandria, Virginia, thanks to my good friend Marshall Beverley of Alexandria. [Laughter]', 'Yes, the Commonwealth is widely known, and properly so, as the Mother of Presidents, and I am proud to be an adopted son. Our Bicentennial celebration vividly reminds us of the native sons and daughters of Virginia who have written glorious chapters in the history of this great country. Their names are American legends--George and Martha Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, Patrick Henry, George Mason, William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, John Tyler, Woodrow Wilson, John Marshall, Robert E. Lee, Harry Byrd, Senior, and now Harry Byrd, Junior.', 'In this campaign, you know where I stand. I stand on your side for limited government, for fiscal responsibility, for rising prosperity, for lower taxes, for military strength, and for peace in the world. I stand for your principles. Can I count on your support November 2?', 'After so many years of war, America is enjoying the blessings of peace with freedom. Not a single young American is fighting and dying today on any foreign battlefield, and I intend to keep it that way. Not a single American wife or sweetheart, mother or father, is wondering whether their loved ones will be a wartime casualty tomorrow, and I intend to keep it that way.', ""After so many years in which America's defensive needs were shortchanged, I proposed in 1975 and again in 1976, the two largest defense outlays in America's history and convinced the Congress to stop slashing away at our military spending and our defense capability."", ""After many, many years of runaway growth in the Federal budget, I submitted a budget for fiscal year 1977 which cut the rate of growth in Federal spending in half. I have held the line on Government spending with 64 vetoes and saved the hard-pressed taxpayers $9 billion. Because I have not been afraid to say no to excessive spending, we will submit a balanced Federal budget by 1978, and we'll have another tax cut in the meantime for the hard-pressed American taxpayer."", ""The Commonwealth of Virginia has a well-deserved reputation for financial integrity, and I will do my very best in the next 4 years to see that your Federal Government matches that reputation you've so well earned under Governor Mills Godwin."", ""After so many years of uncontrolled inflation, we've cut inflation in half, and we'll do even better in the future, because you know, as I know, that inflation is the cruelest tax of all. It hits all segments of our population, but particularly those who live on fixed incomes."", ""Now, after the worst recession in this country in the last 40 years, we have added 4 million new jobs to the American economy--not by creating dead-end jobs at the taxpayer's expense, but by stimulating jobs with a future in the private economy, where five out of the six jobs in America exist today. Still, too many people are out of work; we are not satisfied with the progress that we have made.

We inherited a great many difficulties, as I said in the debate last night. But I was honored to come and to try and serve you during this very troublesome period in American history."", ""I have outlined some of the things we've done, but let me quickly tick off some of the other things I think are accomplishments.

Not a single young American today is fighting or dying on any foreign battlefield, and that's because America is strong."", ""After so many years--the last 10 years in which America's defensive needs have been shortchanged--I proposed the two largest defense budgets in the history of the United States. And this year, with the help of Strom Thurmond, we were able to convince the Congress to give us virtually all that we asked for. And the net result is we can look forward to real progress in maintaining our strategic capability, our conventional capability. We have the will. And let me say, as long as I'm President of the United States, we're going to stay number one."", ""After so many years of runaway growth in Federal spending, I submitted last January a budget which for the first time put a cap on the growth in Federal spending. I have held the line on Federal spending with 66 vetoes, which saved the hard-pressed taxpayer something like $9 billion. I've not been afraid to say no to the excessive spending of a liberal Congress, and let me say we'll keep the pressure on in the next Congress."", 'But speaking of the Congress, you have here in this congressional district one of the strongest, one of the best Members of the House of Representatives in Floyd Spence. You need him, and I need him.', ""I think it goes without saying that you're proud of the wonderful job that Strom Thurmond does for you. And let me say without any hesitation or qualification, believe me, I know Strom Thurmond is up there fighting for a strong national defense, fighting for restraint on spending, fighting for your lowering of taxes. Strom, I thank you from the bottom of my heart."", ""We've heard a great deal about tax reform. The best tax reform that I know is tax reduction. And the best tax reduction that I know is the kind of tax reduction that goes to the middle-income taxpayer who, in the process of legislation in the last 10 or 15 years, has been shortchanged. And therefore, I think if we're going to get equity in our Federal tax laws, we have to increase the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000. That gives that great, vast middle-income taxpayer the kind of fairness, the kind of equity that he deserves."", ""Congress didn't pass what I recommended this year, but let me look them right in the eye. We're going to keep the pressure on them next year; if they don't pass it, the next year. We're going to get that kind of tax relief, and the Congress is going to do it, because the American people know it's right."", ""I tried to mention in the debate last night the kind of progress that we've made in America since I've been President. And believe me, that day of August 9, 1974, was not a very happy day. America was in trouble. We had inflation over 12 percent. We were on the brink of a serious recession. The American people had tragically lost faith and confidence in the White House, and we were still involved in Vietnam."", ""But with the strength of the American people and with the kind of government that we have in this country, we were able to set the ship of state on an even keel and to set a steady course. And we've gone through some tough times for the last 26 months, but the thing that gave Betty and me the kind of satisfaction, the kind of propping that we needed when times looked tough, was the faith that we had in 215 million Americans."", ""And let me say, having gotten through the storm of those 26 months, I think with the progress we've made, with the foundation that we've laid, we can have the most glorious 4 years to begin the third century of American freedom and progress."", 'And so I come before you all here in this great State of South Carolina and ask for your help, ask for your assistance.

I'm not going to ask you who won, but I do want to repeat one or two things that I believe are very important for us to remember."", ""Two years ago, in August, this country was in serious trouble. Today, we have made a substantial amount of progress. We have gone from a lack of trust in the White House to confidence and trust in the White House under President Ford. We have gone from inflation of over 12 percent 2 years ago, to a rate of inflation under 6 percent, and it's going down. We have made a lot of progress in winning the battle against inflation, and we're going to make a lot more between now and the end of the next 4 years."", ""But then, let me make one other observation. America is at peace. We're at peace because we're strong. Not a single young American is fighting or dying on any foreign battlefield tonight. But we're able to do that because the United States has the military capability and the diplomatic skill to strengthen our allies and to get respect from our adversaries."", ""But the most fundamental thing that's important in America is our moral and spiritual strengths. The United States is a nation where each and every one of us has an opportunity to participate--to participate in government, to pray to God, to have our own convictions, and strengthen the character of America.

And each family in this country has been saved $200 by those tough vetoes, and we are going to have more and more if the next Congress is as bad as this Congress.

And one of the highlights of this campaign--and I can say it without any hesitation or qualification--is to have Duke do the honors of introducing me and giving me an opportunity to say to all of you and to the many, many millions of people here in California what I believe in and where I stand.', ""It has been wonderful to come back to California. As I said in Kansas City, I do not concede a single State or a single vote. I believe that the American people in all 50 States want straight talk. They don't want their candidate for the Presidency to promise more than he can deliver, but they want him to deliver everything that he promises."", 'Since Kansas City, I have come to this great State on two occasions. Betty has been here several times, and three of our children have visited various parts of this State. You have given us, as a family, a warm and enthusiastic reception.

Not a single young American is fighting and dying on foreign soil today, and we are going to keep it that way.', ""After so many, many years in which America's defensive needs were shortchanged by the Congress, I proposed the two largest defense outlays in America's history. And I convinced the Congress during this last session that they have been playing with fire and that if we were going to keep the peace that we had, that they could not go through the routine that they followed in the past. And they went along with the kind of defense spending that I proposed, the kind that means we not only have security today but we will have it in the years ahead. And let me say, the next Congress, under the Ford-Dole administration, will have to keep the same commitment to the American people."", 'Let me add parenthetically, my opponent in this campaign--and I say this with some sadness--has proposed a defense cut of at least $5 to $7 billion. That kind of defense cut would require troop withdrawals from strategic outposts overseas, delay or cancel many of our new, advanced weapons systems, such as the B-1 bomber, a slowdown in our ship construction program, or some degree of damage in all of these areas which means closing defense plants and military bases right here in the United States and quite possibly in this great State of California.', ""You don't want that, neither do I, because America must be strong if we are to be the leader, if we are to maintain the peace, if we are to repel aggression, if we are to deter those who would destroy our kind of society."", 'I pledge to you that in the next 4 years we will keep our defenses strong and we will keep the peace and freedom that is so dear to all of us.', 'After so many years of runaway growth in Federal spending, with the Federal budget escalating much too rapidly, I submitted a budget for this current fiscal year which cut the rate of growth in Federal spending by 50 percent. I have held the line on Government spending with 66 vetoes and saved the hard-pressed American taxpayers more than $9 billion.', 'And let me look each of you, as a family, right in the eye--those 66 vetoes have saved each family approximately $200. That is progress, and we will continue that progress in the future.', 'Because I have had the will and the courage and sometimes a little toughness, because I have been able to say no to excessive spending, we will have a balanced budget submitted in 1978. But more importantly, as we cut the rate of growth of Federal spending, as we restrain the kind of spending that is uneconomical, nonproductive, as we accomplish that, I promise to you that we will have another tax reduction at the Federal level.', 'But let me tell you where we are going to have that tax reduction. We are going to give that tax reduction to the middle-income taxpayer who over the years has been shortchanged by the Congress. The middle-income taxpayer deserves a break and Jerry Ford will see to it that you get it. And the way to do it was the way I proposed in January--to increase the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000 per person.', ""Let me illustrate what that means to the head of the household who next January makes out his income tax return. If he has got a family of three children, himself and his wife, that means that that taxpayer will get an additional $1,250 in exemption. That is meaningful. The Congress didn't do it this year, but next year I am going to keep the pressure on that Congress. If they don't do it next year, we will keep the pressure on them the next year, and if they don't do it then, you take them and you lick them in the polls in 1978."", ""Now, after so many years of uncontrolled inflation, we have cut inflation by half in the past 2 years, and I pledge to you that we will do even better under the Ford-Dole administration.

124,Gerald R. Ford ,"October 25, 1976","[""Today I'd like to talk a little commonsense on inflation."", 'Inflation should really be seen as a tax. It cuts into your paycheck or your savings just as surely as writing out your income tax check. And make no mistake about it, inflation is caused by government.', ""Two years ago when I became President, the inflation rate was 12 percent-the cost of everything was going up 12 cents on the dollar each year. Today the rate of inflation is down to less than 6 percent--that's a lot better. But obviously we must keep right on working at it."", ""What's important in this election is to understand what we've been doing right to bring inflation down--and what we must avoid if we are to continue making progress."", 'In the past 2 years, our policies have worked to bring inflation down for three reasons:', ""First, excess Government spending had to be brought under control. So I have vetoed congressional bills 66 times. An argument could have been made for signing every one of those bills. But if inflation was going to be licked, we had to have the courage to draw the line on spending. I did it. And I'm going to keep on doing it, because I don't believe the American people should be taxed anymore--and inflation is just another high tax."", ""Second, while fighting inflation we had to do everything we could to reduce unemployment. So while inflation has been cut in half, we've also helped create 4 million new jobs in America in 17 months--and that's a peacetime record. And we've maintained essential Government services in our cities, and for our schools--and, most important, for our national defense. We've even had some tax cuts, and we can have more if we stick to the course we're on."", ""Finally, we've recognized the reality that inflation cannot be ended overnight. For a decade in America we've had a series of sudden changes in our economic policy. And every time there was not immediate success, we've rushed to a new approach. Well, we've been on a steady and stable course for 2 years now and it's working. I think it would be a serious mistake to change that course."", 'America will lose the battle if spending goes up too fast or if inexperienced hands take over our economic policy and send us charging off in a whole new direction.', ""America is back at peace again. There's honor in your White House again. Four million new jobs in 17 months, and inflation cut in half."", ""Things are getting better. That's why we're feeling good about America. We know we still have a lot of work in front of us. But we remember where we've been, and we know how far we've come."", ""We've all fought the battle against inflation. We know that the enemies are Government spending and drastic changes in policy.

That kind of defense cut would require troop withdrawals from strategic bases overseas; delay or cancel advanced weapons systems like the B-1 bomber; a slowdown in our ship construction program, which helps to keep the peace throughout the world. It would mean closing defense plants and military bases right here, possibly--not only in the United States as a whole but the State of Washington as well.', ""You don't want that, either. I don't want it.

I can't understand why."", 'What would it mean to an individual tax-paying family? I was in a plant the other day. One of the workers asked me, ""What are you doing about tax reduction?"" And I told him how we wanted to raise the personal income tax reduction by $250 per dependent or taxpayer. I said, ""How many children do you have?"" And he said, ""Three."" A wife, three children, himself--under my proposal, that would mean that that taxpayer, when he fills out that tax return in 1977 or 1978, that he would get $1,250 more in a personal exemption. I think that\'s good tax reform.', ""We all know that the middle-income taxpayer has been shortchanged in America, and so the Ford proposal for tax reform, which is tax reduction, will give the kind of tax relief that the middle-income taxpayer needs and wants.

128,Gerald R. Ford ,"October 26, 1976","[""Good morning. I would like to talk with you this morning, as this year's campaign nears its end, about a subject that is very much on the minds of most American families--taxes. As I have traveled around our country in recent weeks, people have told me, Mr. President, things are going well. America is going back to work. There is a new spirit of confidence in our land. But there is one problem that is bothering us very much--the heavy burden of taxes."", 'I completely sympathize with this feeling. And I have tried to do something about it. I asked Congress to cut taxes this year at a rate that would have put an extra $200 in the pocket of the average American family. But Congress turned me down. Next year, with the mandate of your votes behind me, I will go back after them again--and this time we will succeed.', ""I want to cut taxes, not simply because I want American taxpayers to be able to keep more of their hard-earned dollars but also because more money for the American consumer means more growth for the American economy--which in turn means more jobs, higher 'return on investments, and greater prosperity for all of us."", 'Federal income tax payments per capita have gone up more than five times since 1950--more than twice the rate of inflation. This means that we taxpayers are giving more and more of our dollars to the Federal treasury--dollars that we could otherwise be using for ourselves and our families.', 'Of course, when I asked Congress to cut taxes, I linked that request to a matching cut in Federal spending. Reducing taxes while continuing to increase spending is nothing but a cruel illusion. Money for that added spending must come from somewhere. If it does not come from taxes, then it must come from inflation--the harshest and most unfair tax of all. By standing up to Congress against increased Federal spending, I have at least been able to preserve the tax reduction that we put through last year. The opposition party, in contrast, has promised new programs calling for huge increases in Federal spending during the next 4 years.', 'The total cost of these programs would be about $200 billion--requiring a 50-percent increase in Federal taxes.

We have seen in Britain the result of excessive taxation and unwise government spending-inflation, recession, economic stagnation. I am determined to prevent any similar fate from overtaking our own country.', 'We Americans have always been prepared to pay our fair share of the costs of maintaining a free society. We know that taxes are not going to go away. But we also know that taxes pushed too high become a threat to freedom itself. The time has come to take a stand.

This stop this afternoon is another milestone in a great day. We started in Pittsburgh this morning, going to the Jones & Laughlin field steel plant. We first made a speech before the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, and then we flew to the Chicago area and had a wonderful greeting out at Ford City. [Laughter]', 'I was delighted--and now to come to Allstate, it really is tremendous. But let me say one thing, that if you have time tonight, I would hope that you would take 30 minutes and watch a program we are putting on Channel 7. The master of ceremonies is going to be somebody you have heard of, particularly if you are interested in sports. Joe Garagiola is going to be the master of ceremonies. Joe is one of the individuals who volunteered to come out and be an active supporter and campaigner with me; in addition, a former colleague of ours, a good Democrat from the State of Oregon, former Congresswoman Edith Green, and I think we are going to have Chuck and maybe some others on the program. It will give you, I think, a new flavor.', 'I should have added--and I apologize--I think Betty is going to be on it, too. [Laughter] But I keep going around the country trying to get my votes up to her polls.', 'But it is wonderful to be here. And let me take just a few minutes to outline for you some points that I think are worthy of your attention and, hopefully, will be persuasive to you when you make that very vital decision a week from today. It is just 7 days from now.', 'Naturally, I can recall very, very vividly August 9, 1974. It was the day that I took the oath of office and walked from the East Room of the White House to the Oval Office. It was a period of great trouble in America. We had gone through the trauma of Vietnam. There was anger, bitterness, divisiveness. We were on the brink of the worst recession in 40 years, and we had had inflation of 12 percent or more. There was still the problem in Vietnam, with some 50,000 Americans being withdrawn and the circumstances that brought back bad memories. And then, of course, there was the lack of trust and confidence in the White House itself.', 'It was not a very opportune time for a new person to become President of the United States. But, it was my decision that we had to meet first things first, and one of those was to restore, without any hesitation or qualification, the restoration of trust and confidence in the White House itself.', 'I think my being open, by being candid, by being straightforward, the American people--whether they agree or disagree with whatever policies-- know that their President is a person that they can trust and a person who will, in his own way, seek to do what is right for America above all else.', 'Then we had the very difficult problem of how to meet the challenge of the worst recession in 40 years and, at the same time, make a tremendous effort to reduce the rate of inflation which, as I said, was 12 percent or more.', 'But by being firm in the restraint on Federal spending, by not succumbing to quick fixes--and many of them emanated from the Congress--we were able to gradually and, I think, positively reduce the rate of inflation, so that as of today the annual rate of inflation is somewhere between 5½ percent and 6 percent.', 'Now, that is still too high, but I can assure you the policies this country is following today are policies that will keep the pressure on, and we will win that battle and get the rate of inflation down so that we can have a healthy, sustained economy, and the kind of prosperity that all of us know is possible in this great, great country.', ""Early in 1975, I am sure some of you can recall--I can--unemployment began to soar and employment started to plummet. The net result was we had a real trauma in America, the worst recession since the depression days of the 1930's, and a few of us here can remember the hardships that many, many families went through in those days."", 'But instead of losing our cool and trying to do some things that might have been appealing on the surface but fundamentally wrong in an economic sense, we did the things that were compassionate to help those that were tragically unemployed. But at the same time, we initiated programs and restored the confidence of the American people in their economic system. And the net result was we have come out of this recession.', 'You may have heard me say that we have regained 4 million jobs in the last 18 months. That is true. You have heard me say perhaps that we have 88 million people working today--an all-time high--and that is true.', ""You may have heard Mr. Carter say the other day in the debate that we had more people unemployed than any day since the Depression of the 1930's. That is true."", ""But there is one point I think we have to make in all honesty; it is historically accurate. As he alleged, or said, in the 1950's, the early 1950's, we had a low Unemployment rate. That is accurate. But let me point out, at that time we had 3,500,000 young men and women in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines, and a good share of them were overseas. At the present time, we have 2,100,000 young men and women in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. That is 1,400,000 less than we had 18 to 20 months ago."", ""I think we can whip the problem of unemployment. We can have a healthy economy. We can still have an all-volunteer military force, and we don't have to be engaged in a military conflict. The way to solve unemployment is by stimulating the free enterprise system with tax incentives, tax reduction. We don't have to put young men in uniform to solve the problem of unemployment in America."", ""As I said, we have an all-volunteer Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines, and they are good, they are career people. And we are strong because we have the right weapons systems, good leadership, outstanding young people, and they are voluntary recruits. And I can say with great pride that the United States is at peace. Not a single young American is fighting or dying on any foreign battlefield tonight, and they won't."", 'But now that we have turned things around--and I happen to think the American people in this great country have made incredible progress in the last 2 years--but now we have got new opportunities.', 'Here is where I think we ought to focus in the next 2 years, the next 4 years. We ought to focus on trying to improve the quality of life for our 215 million Americans. What does that mean? It means first that we want an economic environment so that people who want to work will have a job. I am not going to argue about statistics. The only criteria by which I judge whether we are doing a good job or not is that the time must come where every young American who wants to work will have a job in America.', 'One of the things that makes America great is the capability and the fact that so many Americans own their own home. I saw some figures just the other day that some 60 to 65 percent of the people in America own their own home or are in the process of buying it. But let me say, having said that, I am not going to take away the deductibility of interest payments on your income tax returns.', 'But how do we stimulate the capability, particularly for the young, to get a new home? Just the other day the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Carla Hills, announced a 50-percent reduction in down payments. That is vital for the young people who are trying to make their first investment.', ""Many of the loaning institutions are beginning to undertake the kind of mortgages, so that in the early days of a mortgage the monthly payments are less when the earning capacity is smaller, and the monthly payments increase as one's earning capacity increases. I think that is an imaginative approach."", 'But the best thing we can do for those that want to buy a house is to see to it that we win the battle against inflation, and we can do that by cutting the rate of growth of Federal spending, as we tried to.', 'In January, I submitted a budget to the Congress where instead of having an 11 percent rate of growth in Federal spending, as we had had for the last 10 years, we tried to cut it in half to 5½ percent. We were quite successful. We should have been more so.', 'I vetoed 66 bills in my best effort to put a little pressure on that big-spending Congress up there. I might say parenthetically, that saved the taxpayers about $9 billion or, if you average it out, about $200 per family in the United States.', ""But the main point is, jobs, housing, health care--I don't believe you have to federalize health care in the United States to maintain or to improve the health care of the American people in this society in which we live."", 'The problem of crime--when I became President in 1974, the rate of crime in America was at 18 percent--unbelievable. In 1975, it was cut back 50 percent to 9 percent. That is still too high. But the encouraging news is that in the first 6 months of 1976, the rate of increase is 3 percent, and we have had significant reduction in some of the more serious areas of crime.', 'Let me tell you one way in which we have tried to solve the problem. All the experts tell us there is a group in our society--hardened criminals, professional criminals--they impose upon all of us law-abiding people a very high percentage of the crime committed in America. And so, we have in the last 12 months had a career criminal program. It has resulted in a significant number of hardened career criminals being apprehended, convicted--95 percent of them have gone to jail, and that is where they belong, and that is where they better stay.', ""One further comment that I think is something all of us ought to really think about. Statements have been made that America is not respected anymore, America's role in the world is not what it ought to be, that our leadership is less than it should be. Let me take one or two examples."", 'Do you realize that in the last 2 weeks all seven Nobel Prizes for physics, chemistry, economics, et cetera--every one of them went to an American for the first time in the history of the Nobel Prizes being awarded. I think that is a pretty good record.', 'And let me add, in the opportunities that I have had to negotiate with adversaries and to work with allies, the allies are honored to be associated with us, and adversaries respect us. They respect the 215 million Americans. They respect the kind of government, the kind of freedom that we have in America, and they know that the American people, when the chips are down, are united in the feeling that we have for the blessings of America. They know that America is strong militarily, economically, industrially, but most important, morally and spiritually.', ""So, whether it is allies wanting to be associated with us or adversaries who respect us and will not challenge us, every American in this country can be proud of our history and can be proud of the things that we are going to do to make that vision of our forefathers a reality in the third century of America's great history."", 'Thank you, very much.']"
132,Gerald R. Ford ,"October 27, 1976","['I want to talk to you today about some of the most remarkable people in this country. These people brought us from the horse and buggy era to the space age, from widespread illiteracy to the finest educational system in the world, from the threat of many crippling and killing diseases to the cure for those diseases, from the early days of the telegraph to instant global communication, from a largely rural Nation to the greatest industrial power in the history of mankind.', ""These remarkable people, who have done so much for our country, are now America's senior citizens. I believe that advancing years should not mean retreating from an active, enjoyable, productive life--a life of security and dignity. Older Americans have some special problems which concern us all."", ""First, let's talk about inflation. Many of our older citizens live on retirement income. Inflation is the deadliest enemy of those fixed incomes. When inflation goes up, our retired workers suffer the most. That is one important reason I am absolutely determined to win the fight against inflation. That is why I have vetoed 66 extravagant bills sent to the Oval Office by a reckless Congress, and why I am proud to say we cut inflation from 12 percent to less than 5 percent in the last 2 years."", 'Second, older Americans are concerned about the integrity of the social security system. Social security benefits are funds that have been earned by retired workers. The Federal Government is legally and morally bound to make sure that the fund is secure. The Social Security Fund is now paying out more than it takes in. As long as that condition exists, the integrity of social security is endangered. We must take firm steps to erase this danger, steps which I proposed last January but which Congress has refused to follow. With your help and your support, we can make the next Congress see the light.', 'Third, older Americans are concerned about rising medical and hospital costs. I have proposed a health insurance program to cover all but the first $750 of the cost of treatment for a catastrophic or prolonged illness. There is no reason a lifetime of savings should be lost to pay medical bills. There is no reason older Americans should have to go broke just to get well.', 'Fourth, older Americans are concerned about crime. I believe greater emphasis should be placed on protecting the potential victim of crime. The career criminal program, which I initiated in several key cities last year, identifies habitual criminals, sets up special prosecution procedures, and in 95 percent of the cases, results in the conviction of those brought to trial with prison sentences that average more than 20 years.', 'Finally, older Americans are concerned with the moral direction of our country. They believe, as I do, that we are only as strong as the moral foundations on which we stand. They believe, as I do, that private morality and public service can--and must--go hand in hand. Older Americans have given us everything we have. They have made this country what it is today. I invite them, and all Americans, to join me on November 2, as we begin a new generation of freedom for America.']"

If Congress had done its job, if Congress had done as I recommended, that family, next April, in making out their income tax return, would have had $1,250 more of tax exemption. Congress failed you.

While we were in the Congress together, she was on the Democratic side and I was on the Republican side. But I understand that somewhere between the plane and here, Edith didn't quite make it. I understand that she is not feeling well. But she has been campaigning with us and, believe me, to have that kind of superb support from a really outstanding Member of the Congress on the Democratic side, I am deeply grateful and very appreciative."", 'Now let me say it is great to be back in New Jersey. I was here a week or 10 days ago. When I was here several weeks ago, I saw a sign that said ""Jersey loves Jerry."" It has gotten bigger since I was here before--[laughter]--but let me say that Jerry loves Jersey, and I mean it from the bottom of my heart.', 'It seems that the enthusiasm in New Jersey has gotten even greater than it was when I was here a few weeks ago. But let me give you all a special invitation, because I know that we are going to carry New Jersey, we are going to win the election. But I invite each and every one of you to come to Washington on January 20, 1977, to be there for the inauguration of Jerry Ford and Bob Dole.', 'As we come to the final days, really, of this great campaign, I want to reiterate where I stand. I stand on your side for limited government, for fiscal responsibility, for rising prosperity, for lower taxes, for military strength that will keep the peace in the world. And may I say with great emphasis, not a single young American is fighting or dying on foreign soil today, and we are proud of it.', 'After so many years where the defense of this country was shortchanged by the Congress, I proposed the two largest defense appropriations in the history of the United States. And I convinced the Congress in this last year that it was good policy, that it was necessary, so that when the United States meets any challenge in negotiation or otherwise, we have the capability, we have the wherewithal so that the United States is number one. It is today, and we are going to keep it that way.', 'After so many years of runaway inflation, let me say that we have made significant progress. We have reduced the rate of inflation from over 12 percent to less than 6 percent.

I held the line on Government spending with 66 vetoes and saved you, the hard-pressed taxpayers of this country, about $9 billion-plus, which means for each family, a $200 saving in Federal spending.

But let me tell you, I am going to submit that to the Congress next year. And if they don't do it next year, we will go back at them again. And if they don't do it in 1978, we will go to the voters of America, and we will beat those people who won't give you that kind of a tax reduction. The middle-income taxpayer in this country, for too long a time, has been shortchanged, and we are going to change that in the Congress, beginning in January of 1977."", 'Now, let me say, we have faced the worst recession in the last 40 years in the last 18 months. We have had unemployment that was far too high. But, at the same time let me say on the affirmative side we have created 4 million more jobs and we have 88 million American people working today--an all-time high-and we have achieved this not by dead-end taxpayer-paid jobs, but by jobs primarily in the private sector where five out of the six jobs are today. And as we move ahead in the next few months under the Ford administration, we are going to have more jobs. We are going to have more jobs in the private sector, because we are going to stimulate the economy with tax reductions for you and for business.

I understand that this organization has a background as a political debating society. Well, following the three debates I had with my opponent, I was asked on several occasions, would I make suggestions for the future or comments on the past. I said, ""Well, I hope they do become institutionalized in our political future,"" and then I said--as I reflected on the debates--that I would make two observations. One, I hope that Jimmy Carter would answer his questions--[laughter]--but I also said I thought I ought to question my answers. [Laughter]', 'But as you have noticed, I have three very special guests here today that are close to me and have been very helpful. One you have met, our son Jack. Then I also have another special guest who has been working with me and traveling to help the cause, and I think it is especially appropriate in an educational institution with the great reputation that you have here at Villanova. One of the outstanding Members of the House or the Senate for 19 years was a Democratic Member of the Congress, Representative Edith Green. Edith Green, I can tell you, was a formidable opponent and a welcome ally. We worked together on many, many programs. We seemed to understand and try to do things in conjunction on educational matters. But Edith Green of the great State of Oregon, who retired 2 years ago, has been helping me. I just want you to know Edith Green is with me and helping in my ideas and recommendations concerning education. Edith, will you please stand up.', ""But there is another guest that has been going with us. You recognized him when he walked in. But let me tell you, when I was very young, as a matter of fact, it was part of my ambition to be a baseball player. Obviously, I didn't succeed. [Laughter] But then after I came back from World War II, I was trying to practice a little law, and I was doing a little high school football broadcasting. Obviously, I didn't succeed. [Laughter]"", ""But we have here Joe Garagiola.1 Maybe I shouldn't say this about Joe's career, but I think Joe feels it is good to be on a winning team for a change. [Laughter] It is great to be here at Villanova, and I am deeply appreciative of the warm welcome. As we come into the home stretch of this great campaign, I can't think of a better place to be than at this great university. I can't think of a better place to be at this great university that has been the alma mater of so many fast runners. As a matter of fact, the only thing that would make me worry about running against Jimmy Carter would be if he had Jumbo Elliott2 as his coach. [Laughter] But let me tell you something else. This one long-distance run is one race I am going to win."", ""Villanova University is truly an outstanding example of those privately supported institutions which have contributed so much to America's greatness and to our country's progress. You share in America's distinguished tradition of private higher education, a tradition that is a century older than our country itself."", 'I am strongly opposed to a suggestion made by my opponent in this campaign that the Government tax all church-supported properties other than the church building itself. This would have serious implications, as I have analyzed the the problem, not only for church-supported schools but for church-supported hospitals, orphanages, and retirement homes.', ""As far as our Government is concerned, those activities are as much a part of the church's mission as the church's place of worship. There is a constitutional separation of church and state in this country, and I will not see that separation sacrificed for a few more dollars in Federal tax revenues."", 'Americans must never forget that privately endowed colleges and universities like Villanova serve important public functions. Today, as in the past, they help prepare our national leadership in arts, the sciences, law, medicine, religion, and in business, as well as in government.', ""The strength, the vitality of America's privately endowed colleges and universities are essential to our educational system in America. If these private institutions should close, shifting the burden from private donors to public taxpayers, the tax load would be infinitely heavier. We must not let this happen, and as far as I am concerned, we will not."", 'Let me repeat with emphasis what I have said many, many times before. I approve, support, and encourage the principle of volunteer giving to help finance higher education, and I will continue to strongly oppose any legislative proposals which discourage such support, including those which would limit Charitable tax deductions, disallow the full value of appreciated assets, or exclude the State tax deductions.', 'We must also find, and find as quickly and effectively as possible, ways through the tax system of actually easing the burden of families whose sons and daughters attend nonpublic schools and to help families cope with the expenses of a college education.', 'Although I am a product of public education through the University of Michigan, I was the beneficiary of a law school education at Yale Law School.', 'But I believe very deeply that the competition of nonpublic schools to the public school system is helpful in upgrading and maintaining the level of the public schools. Competition in education is just as important as competition on the athletic field, in business, or elsewhere, and we must maintain our nonpublic school systems throughout the United States.', ""Let me tell you something else that I haven't forgotten. Two years ago, in October of 1974, when I visited Philadelphia, some of your fellow students thoughtfully gave me a Villanova football jersey. [Laughter] After a year or about a year after that, I understand that some of you saw photographs of my daughter, Susan, wearing it. [Laughter] Well, Susan couldn't be here today, but I think you will recognize this jersey."", 'As you obviously saw, that jersey had number 76 on it, and it is on there, as I understood it, because some of you were encouraging me to run in 1976. I took your advice. [Laughter] And with your help, we are going to win November 2.', 'I have come to this great university to share with you some views that I have of America in 1976 and my hopes for America in the next 4 years and beyond.', ""During the last 2 years, in the aftermath of a very difficult war and a painful ordeal of economic adversity and political crisis, we reached a very critical turning point in America's history."", 'Throughout most of your lives, as I look around this wonderful audience, America has been in turmoil. Some of our most beloved leaders have been assassinated; there was a war that seemed to have no end; there were destructive riots on our streets and on some of our college campuses; we suffered runaway inflation and the worst recession in 40 years; we were betrayed by corruption at the highest levels of our Government. Fortunately, the skies are much brighter this October. And I think we can say that the administration has had something to do in turning the economy around.', 'We are in the midst of growing prosperity. More Americans were on the job in 1976 than ever before in the history of the United States, some 88 million people gainfully employed. Many, or I should say too many people are still out of work, but we are on the move, and I will not be satisfied until every American who wants a job has a job. We have cut inflation in half, and we are making continuous headway in that regard.', 'America is at peace. There are no young Americans fighting or dying on any foreign soil today, and I say with emphasis, we are going to keep it that way.', ""Perhaps most important of all, America's trust in the White House has been restored. As I said on taking the oath of office as President on August 9, 1974, our long national nightmare is over. In the last 2 years the United States of America has made an incredible comeback, and we are not through yet."", ""In 200 years as a free people much has changed in our Nation, but America's basic goals remain the same. Americans want a job with a good future; Americans want homes in decent neighborhoods and schools with quality education; Americans want physical security, safety against war, and safety against crime; safety against pollution in the water we drink and in the air that we breathe; we want medical and hospital care when we are sick and costs that will not wipe out our savings; we want the time and the opportunity to enlarge our experience through recreation and through travel, both at home and abroad."", 'These are the goals which every politician and every citizen, I think, truly has for America. They are not some mystic vision out of the future. They are the continuing agenda for action in this great country.', 'So, the question in this campaign of 1976 is not who has the better vision of America. The question is who can best make that vision a reality.', 'The American people are ready for the truth, simply spoken, about what government can do for them and what government cannot and what it should not do. They will demand performance, not promises.', 'There are some in this political year who claim that more government, more spending, more taxes and more control over our lives will solve our problems. More government is not the solution; better government is the solution.', 'It is time that we thought of new ways to make government a capable servant rather than a meddling master. It is time we trusted the American people with the truth, that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.', 'It is not enough for anyone to say, trust me. Trust must be earned. Trust is not having to guess what a candidate means. Trust is leveling with the people before the election about what you are going to do after the election. Trust is not being all things to all people, but being the same thing to all people. Trust is not cleverly shading words so that each separate audience can hear what it wants to hear, but saying plainly and very simply what you mean and meaning what you say.', 'I am proud of the maturity of the American people who demand more honesty, truthfulness, and candor of their elected representatives. The American people, particularly young people, cannot be expected to take pride or even participate in a system of government that is defiled and dishonored, whether in the White House or in the halls of Congress. Personal integrity is not too much to ask of public servants. We should accept nothing less, and the American people will not do so.', 'On November 2, the thoughts, the feelings of our Bicentennial will be expressed in a specific choice: What will we take with us into our third century? What will we leave behind? What sort of government will help us reach our goals, not burden us with excess baggage?', ""Our Nation's founders did not seek to guarantee our happiness, only our freedom to pursue happiness in our own way. The government alone cannot make life meaningful. It can protect your freedom to pursue happiness, but it cannot make you happy. It can protect your freedom to worship, but it cannot give you faith in God. It can help you to be healthy and well educated, but it cannot plant purpose in your mind or in your body."", 'Only you, the individual, with the help of family, church, and community-only you can do just that.', 'Recently we have heard a great deal about the apathy and the frustration of American voters in this election. But I see hopeful signs in this Bicentennial election and every day that passes--particularly in the last week--I have become more and more encouraged. I see not sterile cynicism and skepticism, but the signs of an new realism emerging all over this great country. Americans are realizing that there is only so much the government can do for you, and that every promise has to have its price.', 'We have been laying the foundations for a great third century in America, not on false promises or empty optimism but on a sound and realistic attitude towards ourselves and towards our system.', ""For the past 2 years, I have done my best to put this Nation back on an even keel, to chart a steady course for our country's future. We have come a long, long way. We have a long way to go to do all the things that this country has the potential to do."", 'We can build an America that not only celebrates history but makes it, that offers limited government and unlimited opportunity that concerns itself with the quality of life, that proves individual liberty is still the key to common progress.', 'I have been very proud to serve as your President. I love this country just as all of you do. It would be the highest honor of my life for you and your fellow Americans to say to me November 2, Jerry Ford, you have done a good job. Keep right on doing it.', 'Thank you very much.']"

Dick has been traveling with me, and I want to express to him--and he's with me here tonight-my deep appreciation for your loyal and dedicated support."", ""But as I started to say, I'd like to experiment tonight.

I hope you won't moan or groan, and please don't fall asleep. [Laughter]"", ""But I would like to talk very seriously and very straight from the shoulder, and let you refresh your memory, if you would for just a moment. Go back to August of 1974. Naturally, I'll never forget that occasion because on August 9 of that month, I was sworn in as President of the United States."", 'America was in very deep trouble. Faith and confidence in the White House had been lost, and I think there was an undercurrent of lack of faith, really, among 215 million Americans, in our government and our future. We certainly were suffering the worst inflation since the turn of the century--over 12 percent. We were on the brink of the worst economic recession in 40 years, and we were still involved very substantially in Vietnam.', 'I can recall very vividly after taking the oath of office in the East Room of the White House, and going with Betty to the Oval Office and saying to her that we had to stand tall and strong because we loved America, as all Americans do. But we had to find a way to put the ship on an even keel and to set a steady course.', ""And slowly but surely--because the American people felt that they had a new trust in the White House itself and that we weren't going to panic and we weren't going to try any quick fixes that sounded good but didn't have any substance--and so slowly but surely there was this restoration of confidence in America, its Government, its people, its principles, its aims, its objectives."", 'People could begin to see that because we were doing the right thing in the economy, that the rate of growth of inflation was beginning to dampen down, that the dollar was not eroding as rapidly as it had in 1973 and 1974. And although we were in a recession--unemployment was going up and employment was going down--they saw that we were doing fundamentally the right thing to get us out of the problems we were in. Then, of course, we left Vietnam, and our allies were reassured by the strength that we had in America, and our adversaries saw that we meant business, and we were going to be respected.', 'So then, we started to move. And you could feel this new spirit that was generating in America. And you, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, probably participated more directly because of the Bicentennial affairs that took place in Philadelphia.', ""But wasn't that a wonderful experience for all Americans that we could celebrate our 200th birthday with a rejuvenation, a rebirth of the spirit that our forefathers developed when they put this country together 200 years ago--13 colonies, less than 3 million people."", 'But they faced adversity and they came out of it and gave us this blessing. But on the Fourth of July, after all our troubles, America seemed to be on the move again. There had been this incredible feeling that faith had been restored and that progress was on its way; and we could look down the road with real vision, a vision of achievement, that we could not only read about history but we could make history in our third century.', ""And now we've got a great election, a great election that is just 5 1/2 days away, really. It's the first election of a President in our third century, and it's an election that will undoubtedly make a difference in the course that America takes not only for the next 4 years but for the next century."", ""You know what the differences are, but let me talk about what I foresee as what will be done in the next 4 years if I have the opportunity to be your President. We've gotten most of our past troubles out of the way, so we can begin to have some things done that will be an added element to the quality of life that we have here in America."", ""What do we want? We certainly want a job for every American who wants to work. We aren't going to argue about statistics. I want the kind of a society where the free enterprise system makes it possible for any American who wants to work to get a job, and we're going to achieve that objective in the next 4 years."", 'But the quality of life not only depends on the job but it depends on the home, the family. The housing industry has been in some trouble during our economic recession. But I was so encouraged the last 2 months--the statistics indicated that we were really on the upswing. And what does that mean? It means that people are willing to invest, they have a little extra money for that down payment, they can gamble on those monthly mortgage payments.', ""So we're going to try and help them, my administration. We're going to cut the down payments by 50 percent. We're going to make sure that if a person has a 20- or 30-year mortgage, that the monthly payments are less when a young couple is earning less. And the monthly payments will be higher when a person has more money as he advances up the salary scale. But the strength of this country is the home and the family, and we want those neighborhoods preserved."", 'And then, of course, we want good health care. I think the American people do get good health care, but we have to make positive that it is health care they can afford. And we owe a very special obligation to the older citizens of this country--some 33 million, as I recall the figure--people who have worked hard, saved, mainly living on retirement incomes. We owe them an obligation. That obligation, I think, is to make certain that if any one of them has an extended, prolonged, expensive illness, that instead of having their savings depleted by the kind of costs that to occur--and I venture to say in this room tonight, everybody here knows of that kind of a serious tragedy in any family.', ""So, that's why I proposed to the Congress last year what is called catastrophic health insurance, so that any one of our older citizens, senior citizens, cannot have any more than a $750-a-year bill for hospital or medical expenses. That relieves them and gives them the kind of security that I think would be better for their frame of mind and, certainly, for their savings that they're earned over the years."", ""But speaking of the senior citizens--and I know there are some here--there are other things that we must do: cut the rate of inflation. We've done quite well, but we're going to do better--from over 12 percent to under 6 percent. That's better than a 50-percent rate of progress. But we have to get it down, and we will."", ""Then we have to make sure that the cost-of-living escalator for social security payments are there for them to count on. But I have to say that we owe an obligation, likewise, to make sure that that Social Security Trust Fund is sound financially. I proposed a method that I think was fair to achieve that. Congress didn't respond. But we have an obligation to those who are retired and those who will shortly be retired so that trust fund is available and they don't have to Worry about it."", ""And then, of course, of all the people in this great country who need most the protection from crime--it's our older senior citizens. So, we've got to do something in the quality of life area to make certain, to make positive, that those who commit a crime are convicted and go to jail."", ""My administration has always felt that the emphasis should be on the victims of crime, not the people that commit the crimes. Let me tell you what we're trying to do. There are, unfortunately, in our society, some who are what we call hardened criminals, career criminals. Starting better than a year ago, we tried in 12 cities, a program of helping State and local law enforcement officers, the courts, with a career criminal program. They went in there and they identified two or three or five career criminals, and they went after them with an amazing rate of success."", ""I think they, in the 12 cities, have a record of conviction of about 90 to 95 percent, and the average sentence is 20 years in jail. That's what ought to happen to them. But then, now that it has been successful, we are going to expand it, I think, to 24 or 36 cities in the next 12 months. But it's an obligation of every one of us to our senior citizens that they can walk to the store, go to church, visit their friends in safety on the streets of wherever they may live."", 'But also, we need to make certain that our younger generation has a quality education. The Federal Government does contribute to local and State educational programs. But I was dumbfounded just the other day to find that there are 110 different Federal educational programs. If you can, imagine how many bureaucrats in Washington are managing 110 educational programs.', ""But anyhow, what we've tried to do and what we are going to do is to simplify it. Instead of having 110 individual programs, we are going to try and have a single block grant program in the major areas, the major 25 programs. We'll increase the money and, at the same time, we'll diminish the number of forms. We'll get the money for the teachers and for the students. Doesn't that make a lot of sense to you? Sure does to me."", 'And then, I think we have to see how we can finance some of these programs. Last January, as the Members of the House and Senate know, I presented a budget to them that was different than budgets had been in recent years. We found that the rate of growth of Federal spending over the last 10 years had been going up at a rate of 11 percent per year. Unbelievable. And if you projected that for the next 25 years, this country would have been in dire fiscal circumstances. So we decided that we were going to put a lid on the rate of growth of Federal spending, and we did. We cut it in half.', ""Now, the Congress didn't respond as well as they should; they did a little better than they had been doing. But at the same time that I recommended that we cut the rate of growth of Federal spending, I said for every dollar we save in Federal spending, I recommend a dollar in tax reduction."", 'I put two main points in that tax reduction program. I said, number one, the middle-income people in this country have been shortchanged. These middle-income people--who really are 50 percent of the taxpayers in America--could get the best tax relief by a suggestion of increasing the personal exemption, which is now $750 a year, to $1,000 a year.', 'The other day I was visiting a factory and talking to some workers, and one of the men said, ""Well, Mr. President, what will you do for my family under your tax proposal or tax reduction recommendation?"" I said, ""Well, how many children do you have?"" He said, ""I have three, and a wonderful wife."" I said, ""All right, if Congress had done the job instead of going off in the wrong direction in tax reduction,"" I said, ""next April when you figured out your income tax return, you could have had, with three children, a wife, and yourself, $1,250 more in personal exemption."" He said, ""Gosh, how could the Congress be so stupid not to do that?""', ""Well, anyhow, let me say this: We're going to submit it to them in January. We'll give them another crack at it, because the middle-income taxpayers need that relief."", 'But in order to create the jobs that are essential and necessary in America-and we have about 2,000,000, 2,500,000 that are coming into the labor market from our younger people that are finishing school--industry has to have an incentive to expand in their locations where they may be, or to build a new plant, to buy better equipment. So, I think the business community ought to get some tax relief so they can create the jobs that are so important if we are going to give job opportunities in the private sector. Oh, I know some people in Congress advocate putting everybody on the Federal payroll. That is a dead-end, no-advancement area. What we need is a job in the private sector, where people can work with certainty and with an opportunity for advancement.', ""Now one final point: Nothing pleases me more that we can say, and say with honesty: There's not a single young American fighting or dying on any foreign battlefield tonight. But to maintain that, we have to be strong enough to convince our allies that we are prepared to work with them to preserve the peace in the free world. We have to be strong enough so when the President sits down and looks the head of government of an adversary nation straight in the eye, he has to know that America is strong and that America has the will, America has the courage and fortitude to do what's right. The only way you can have that is to have an Army, a Navy, an Air Force, and Marine Corps that are number one."", ""I don't think that you can cut the Defense Department, as some suggest, and have our military capability unsurpassed. To deter aggression, to meet any challenge, to protect our national security, I believe that the President of the United States has an obligation to see to it that the necessary funds are there to buy the best weapons, to have the best leadership, to have the best training, to have the strength that adversaries respect and allies appreciate. Then America can keep the peace that we have and be the leader in the world, and we will under this administration."", ""One final thought. Faith tells me that the party workers in Delaware County are the best not only in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania but in the whole United States. Pennsylvania is a key State in this election. We can win or lose. We can have the direction of America going one way if Pennsylvania is on our side, and the country can go another way if Pennsylvania is on the other side. It's that very practical result."", ""So Delaware County is the county that can make the difference. So all 3,000 of you here, I hope, will maximize your efforts and turn in the biggest vote, a vote for America, a vote for America's future. We're on the march; we're on the way. There's a new faith; there's a new spirit."", ""What you do between now and November 2 when the polls close will make a significant difference in the third century of America's future. I know you won't let America down and, as the next President, I won't let you down."", 'Thank you very much.']"

No American is fighting or dying on any foreign soil, and we are going to keep it that way. Your lives are not being threatened by war or interrupted by the draft. I have spent most of my time in the last 2 years working for peace, and I am determined to keep America out of war in the next 4 years.', ""And what does that mean? That means that America's young people, like the many young people I see in this great audience here today, can go to school and get a good education. That means they can plan their careers confidently, buy a home, raise a family, and look forward to a great life."", 'I pledge, as I said a moment ago, that in the next 4 years, because we are strong militarily, because we are skillful diplomatically, that America will be at peace, and we will keep it that way.

I refer here to the contribution to the B-1 bomber program where GE puts those engines together so we can have replacements for our aging B-52's. We need the B-1. There is no right--it would not be fair to send our young pilots in the years ahead to do a job for you and for me in an aircraft, a weapons system that is older than they are, and that won't be the case under President Ford."", 'We not only have to keep ourselves strong militarily and skillful diplomatically, we have to keep our economy strong. I know Ohio believes, as I do, in growth and in progress. I announced this morning at the airport a very important decision, which is particularly important to southern Ohio. My new policy is designed to keep America number one in the nuclear energy field in order to maintain our world leadership in that area. We must maintain our position as a major reliable supplier of fuel for nuclear power, not only in the United States but around the world.', 'The diffusion plant near Portsmouth, Ohio, has played a leading role in supplying enriched uranium for electric power plants in the United States and for the rest of the world. Last May, I announced that we will build an add-on plant in Portsmouth, Ohio. The Energy Research and Development Agency [Administration] is now asking for bids for further design work on this add-on plant. The construction--listen to this--the construction on this important addition at Portsmouth is to begin next year, early 1977. This is a $4,400 million construction project, and it means 6,000 construction jobs right here in southern Ohio.', 'America needs more good productive jobs like that created by a healthy, growing economy. My policies have brought up America from the depths of its Worst recession in 40 years, and with your support we can continue the march to a sound and sustainable prosperity. With your support, I will continue the sensible, commonsense approach that we have to your Government by keeping the lid on Federal spending, by doing an even better job in cutting the rate of inflation.', 'You know when I became President a little over 2 years ago, the cost of living was increasing at the rate of over 12 percent. By doing the right thing, keeping a lid on Federal spending, by having tax reduction, stimulating the economy in the right way, we have cut the rate of inflation under 6 percent, and we are going to do better in the next 4 years.', 'But if we are going to have the kind of an economy that is one that will make jobs available in the private sector, we have to have additional tax reductions. There is an old saying that I firmly believe in--the best tax reform is tax reduction. As I look across this group here this morning on Fountain Square, I know that most of you are in the middle-income taxpaying brackets. The record shows that the middle-income taxpayers have been shortchanged, and we are going to change that in the next Congress.', 'I recommended to the Congress last January that the personal exemption ought to be increased from $750 to $1,000. That is a one-third increase in the tax exemption you would be getting. But I was out to a plant the other day and I asked the man, I said, ""How big a family do you have?"" He said, ""I have three kids and a wife."" I said, ""If the Congress had acted responsibly in this last session, they would have done what I proposed be done last January, which would have been to increase the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000 and you, Mr. Taxpayer, with three kids and a wife and yourself, when you make out that income tax return next April, you would have had $1,250 more of personal exemption.""', ""Now, Congress didn't do what I proposed. But Congress is going to have it on their doorstep when they come back, and they better pass it. If they don't pass it in 1977, we are going to go after them in 1978, and if they don't do it in 1978, we are going to beat them in the election in 1978."", 'Now let me tell you something else that I support. I mentioned it in the last debate. In my view, we lost a great, great American tradition when the Supreme Court ruled out voluntary prayer in public schools. Every child should have the opportunity for voluntary prayer in school, and I strongly support a constitutional amendment that would permit voluntary prayer in public schools.', 'We have much to do. We have to keep strong so we can keep the peace, so that when I negotiate with an adversary, whether it is from the Soviet Union or any other country, or when I negotiate with our allies, they know America is number one.', ""We have much to do to keep the economy strong so we have prosperity for our people. We must do what is right so that our older people have an opportunity to enjoy the quality of life that they have so richly earned. But let's do all these things together.

Today, that remains the central purpose of American foreign policy.', 'Throughout my time as President, I have shaped our foreign policy according to four basic principles:', ""First, we have sought to maintain America's unquestioned military strength. One of the most significant achievements of this administration is that, after a decade in which Congress slashed a total of $50 billion from defense budgets, we reversed that downward trend. And we have finally convinced the Congress to stop shortchanging America's defense. As long as I am President, we will have an Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps unsurpassed in military capability."", 'Second, we have tried to maintain and strengthen our friendship with our allies. Those relationships have never been better--a point that was echoed repeatedly as world leaders came to America to share in our Bicentennial celebration.', 'Third, working from a position of strength, we have sought to reduce tensions in the world and to avert the threat of nuclear holocaust. Early in my administration, I met with Secretary Brezhnev in Vladivostok to begin negotiations to limit nuclear armaments. Today those negotiations are 90 percent complete.', 'Finally, we have tried to act as leader and as peacemaker in such troubled regions as the Middle East and southern Africa.', 'The peace that exists today is directly related to our hard work, our strength, and our skillful diplomacy. I am very proud of what we have accomplished. I am very proud to be the first President since Dwight Eisenhower to seek election with America at peace.', 'This is not a time to weaken our defense, to deny our troops essential new weapons, to undermine European democracies by hinting at new relationships with Communist leaders in Western Europe, to withdraw our troops from South Korea, to upset the balance in the Middle East, or to concede such nations as Yugoslavia to the Soviet sphere.', 'To preserve the peace, we must be willing to pay the price for a mighty military force.', 'To preserve the peace, we must be willing to shoulder the burdens of our alliances and friendships.', 'To preserve the peace, we must be tough-minded and persistent in dealing with our adversaries.', 'To preserve the peace, we must be true to the ideals of America--to our love of freedom and dignity and justice for all mankind.', 'These are my goals as your President.

She and I served together, she on the Democratic side of the aisle and I on the Republican. But there was no person in the Congress who was more knowledgeable and more farsighted, more helpful to education in the Congress on either side of the aisle, than former Congresswoman Edith Green, and I want to express my appreciation for her loyal and wonderful support. Thank you very, very much Edith.', ""Obviously, it's wonderful to be here in Indianapolis, a city growing stronger under good Republican management and Hoosier pride, a city with a tradition of outstanding leaders from such men as Dick Lugar and Bill Hudnut."", ""Before Bill became your mayor, he was a colleague of mine in the House of Representatives.

You can keep one here to keep Indianapolis on the right track, as long as we can have the other one in Washington to get Congress back on the right track.', ""Let me say a word or two about your great Governor. When Doc Bowen came to Indiana, to its State House, 4 years ago, that was one house call that helped over 5 million people. His wisdom and his experience have served you so well in the past 4 years, and I just am so encouraged to see that the voters of the great State of Indiana are apparently going to give him an overwhelming victory. And that's a great, great tribute to you Doc, for the superb job that you've done."", 'Now we have less than a week to go before Election Day. One of the major issues in this Presidential campaign has been the state of our national economy. Of all the differences between Mr. Carter and me, none is more important than our differences over economic policy. These differences have a lot to do with our contrasting views of what the fundamental role of our government should be in the United States of America.', 'I was interested to read a recent summary by the National Association of Business Economists--60 percent of those professional economists replied that a Ford administration would be far more likely to pursue economic policies in the national interest. Only 14 percent gave such a vote of confidence to Mr. Carter.', 'The Ford administration in the 2 years-plus has earned the confidence of the American people by addressing our immediate problems while maintaining a long-term view of economic policy.', 'When I came to office 2 years ago, the economy was suffering the most disastrous consequences of many years of short-term and shortsighted policies. We had experienced budget deficits in 14 of the last 15 years. Wage and price controls-they burdened us with a tax structure which did not encourage sufficient capital formation. We all remember what the consequences were. Inflation was growing, confidence was shrinking among consumers and among businessmen, and our economy was in the early stages of the worst recession in 40 years.', ""I don't mind admitting I faced considerable pressure from the Congress and elsewhere to try the same old short-term solutions. They sounded good on paper but, believe me, in the 25 years that I have been in Congress and seen us go through the same experiences, I knew deep in my heart that that was not the road to travel."", 'The economic downturn, as you will recall, set off a clamor for huge emergency Federal subsidies for more and bigger Federal programs and higher deficit spending. I rejected this policy of panic and, I think, we were right.', ""Instead, I chose policies designed to build long-term, sustained economic growth without inflation. Instead of trying to buy our way out of the recession by throwing open the doors of the Federal Treasury, we took steps to revitalize American business and American industry. The result has been a recovery built on a very solid base. We've cut inflation by more than half. From the frightening annual rate of over 12 percent, our latest monthly figures show it running at 4.8 percent. That's real progress."", 'Equally important, my administration is putting America back to work. Since the recession low of March 1975, total employment has increased by nearly 4 million people. We have more Americans working today than ever before in the history of the United States, nearly 88 million.', 'Unemployment is still too high. Let me point out, however, that its failure to drop more sharply this year is the result of an unprecedented increase in the size of the American labor force. That great increase in the size of the labor force is a sign of renewed confidence in the health of our economy and the dramatic increase in job opportunities.', ""Let me say very strongly, I won't be satisfied until every American who wants a job has a job. But those jobs won't be secure, those pay checks won't be protected unless we keep inflation under control. Inflation hurts all of us, especially our older citizens on fixed incomes. It robs their savings, their purchasing power, and everybody else's."", ""Inflation not only cuts our purchasing power, it ultimately cuts confidence and it is the most basic element in a sustained recovery. Consumers, fearful of inflation, hold back on purchases. We vividly recall that in late 1974. Inventories accumulate, production slows down, businessmen defer investment in plants and equipment, and jobs are lost. We know this scenario much too well. We've seen it happen before in our history. We must not let it happen again, and this administration will not permit it in the next 4 years."", ""America's confidence in its economy has been restored. We've shown that inflation can be driven down, can be cured. Now we must keep America's confidence by continuing to hold the line. We must keep raising America's high standard of living. Our economic progress depends, as always, on our ability as a nation to foster capital investment and increase the productivity of our workers."", ""I have proposed reforms to the Congress to stimulate what some call capital formation through tax incentives. That's a big mouthful, but I prefer to use the term--and it's much more meaningful--job creation, because that's what the proposals would do as a practical matter."", 'To meet our employment goals, to create 10 million jobs over the next 4 years, 2,500,000 each year for the next 4 years, will require a substantial increase in the share of our gross national product committed to the private sector.', ""Some of the so-called tax loopholes condemned by my opponent are in fact important tools to encourage capital formation. They are incentives for business expansion, for business investment, so our economy can employ more people and produce more goods and more services. America's government must make it easier, not harder, for American business to find the capital that makes the whole system work."", 'In our third debate, last Friday--and I might make a comment about that-I was asked if I had any suggestions about the debates. I said number one, they ought to be institutionalized--and I hope they will in future campaigns-- but I had a personal observation. I hoped that Mr. Carter would answer his questions and that I would question my answers. [Laughter]', ""As I was saying, I was asked in the debate last Friday--or my opponent was asked--what were the reasons behind his rather drastic slippage in the polls. In my view, one very important reason for his precipitous decline in popularity is that since his party's convention he has relied very, very heavily on the discredited old formula of more promises, more programs, and more spending."", ""The American people today are in a very realistic frame of mind. They know that every promise has its price. The price in Governor Carter's case would be a minimum of $100 billion up to maybe $200 billion every year out of the Federal Treasury. That's the price of the new spending programs that he endorses."", 'You and I know that there are only two, only two alternatives: The Federal Government can pay for those programs by increasing taxes or it can borrow the money to pay for them, putting more pressure on the credit markets, making it harder for business and industry to find the money that they need, adding to the deficit, and fueling the fires of inflation. That, in my judgment, is the wrong approach altogether, and I will vigorously disapprove of it in the next 4 years.', 'We need to hold down the rate of growth in Federal spending, and as the Members of Congress who are here know, when I submitted the budget in January of last year, I said we could not afford the 11-percent increase in Federal spending that had been the trend for the last 10 years. So, I submitted a budget that would reduce that rate of growth by 50 percent to an increase of 5½ percent.', ""Congress didn't respond. They did a little better than they had been doing, but they've got a long way to go. Let me say to every Member of Congress, Democrat or Republican, we're going to submit a budget in January next year that will have the same pressure on Federal spending, and I want their support to keep the lid on that spending."", ""Well, I've been trying to keep that lid on, and we've done that with some 66 vetoes, saved the American taxpayer--or saved the American Treasury--about $9 billion, averaging approximately $200 per family in Federal spending."", 'In addition, let me say, we can reduce taxes if we act responsibly in restraining the growth of Federal spending. We can reduce taxes for private individuals and corporations as well.', 'I have proposed--and I reiterate here--the increase in the personal exemption by one-third, from $750 to $1,000, and trimming the corporate income tax rate at the same time. The most necessary tax reform today is tax relief for the middle-income taxpayer. I submitted a tax reduction bill to the Congress last year that called for the increase in the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000.', 'Congress didn\'t respond. I don\'t understand why because I was talking to some workers out in the factory the other day and one of the men legitimately asked me, ""What are you doing about my tax burden? They\'re going up locally. They\'re going up statewide."" I said, ""Well, I proposed that Congress give to you this increase in the personal exemption."" I said, ""How many children do you have?"" He said, ""I have three."" It turned out he had a wife and three children. I said, ""If Congress had been smart, they would have given you that kind of tax relief, which would have given you the opportunity next April when you make out your 1040 return, you would have $1,250 more in personal income tax exemption."" I said, ""How could Congress be so stupid not to do it?""', ""We're going to submit it to them in January. We're going to submit the same proposal to them in January, and if they don't pass it in 1977, we'll resubmit it in 1978. And if they don't pass it in 1978, I'm going out and try to beat them all in the election in 1978."", ""Well, I've indicated to you that I intend to propose as the first order of business in Washington next January an additional tax cut of $10 billion. And as soon as the Congress is organized, I intend to meet with its leadership--Democrat and Republican--so that we can put a tax cut at the top of the legislative agenda for 1977."", 'In the meantime, I believe that every candidate for Federal office, from the White House to the House of Representatives, has an obligation in the closing days of this campaign to say precisely where he stands on tax cuts. Specifically, I call upon all candidates for the Congress to tell their prospective constituents before the election, not after the election, whether they will support the kind of additional tax cuts that I have proposed.', 'I pledge to the American people that I will seek tax cuts as the number one priority in the next Ford administration, and I ask for the help of voters in electing a Congress that will work with me toward that end.', ""My view is that our Government should return more money and more power to the American people and to the State and local authorities closest to the American people. In recent years, we've seen a trend toward greater centralization, greater power in Washington, and less State and local authority in your respective communities and States. This trend has not only hurt the American economy, it has sapped the American spirit."", 'The continuing economic crisis in Great Britain--you may have read yesterday, it was worse yesterday than it has been before--tells us all we need to know about the dangers of too much government, too much spending on borrowed money. Just a few days ago, the value of the British pound dropped to a new all-time low. Inflation has been running at approximately 25 percent. Government spending in Great Britain now accounts for 60 percent of the entire British economy.', 'The courageous--and I emphasize courageous--British Prime Minister of that troubled nation has gone to the very heart of the problem. Listen to what he said just a few weeks ago to his own Labor Party, the party that played an important role in helping to create the crisis that they face. Prime Minister Jim Callaghan said, and I quote, ""We used to think that you could spend your way out of a recession and increase employment by cutting taxes and boosting government spending."" He went on to say, ""I will tell you in all candor, that option no longer exists and that insofar as it ever did exist, it worked by injecting inflation into the economy. And each time that has happened, the average level of unemployment has risen."" He went on to say, ""Higher inflation followed by higher unemployment, that\'s the history of the last 20 years in Great Britain."" We must not let that happen in the United States. We can avoid it, and as long as I am President of the United States we will avoid it.', 'That is but one of the many important reasons I am a candidate for the Presidency in 1976. I need your help. I need your support. I need your vote on November 2.', ""You know where I stand. You know what I've done. You know what we can do. Under my Presidency in the next 4 years--and with your support and our victory here in Indiana and nationwide next November 2--I will never let you down."", 'Thank you very much.']"

But I won't be satisfied until everybody who wants a job, who wants to work, has a job in the United States."", 'But now let us think about the future security of this country--strong economy at home, peace in the world, peace through strength, and hope and vision and expectation for those people around the world who look at America.

141,Gerald R. Ford ,"October 29, 1976","['I want to talk with you this morning about one of the greatest concerns of this campaign. The issue is crime.', 'For too long, the fear of crime has cast its ominous shadow on the streets of America. For too long, the conscientious efforts of law enforcement officers throughout America have been compromised by a system of ""revolving-door"" justice and by a lack of adequate community involvement in crime prevention. For too long the rights of the victims of crime have not had the same protection as the rights of the criminal defendants.', 'During the past 2 years we have begun to make headway against crime in America. In 1974 the crime rate increased by 18 percent. Last year the increase was down to 9 percent. And for the first 6 months of this year, the increase in the overall crime rate was only 3 percent. The incidence of violent crime--murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault--actually went down.', 'This is real progress, not just because of the statistics but because Americans are beginning to feel safer in their own neighborhoods and on the streets of our cities.', ""The role of the Federal Government in law enforcement is limited. We do not have a national police force, and we don't want one. But the Federal Government can serve as a model for law enforcement efforts at the State and local level. My administration is setting a good example."", 'First, I have proposed a comprehensive revision of the Federal Criminal Code to replace the overlapping, contradictory, and outdated statutes now on the books.', 'Second, I have proposed strict, automatic prison sentences for those convicted of such Federal crimes as hijacking and kidnaping and for those who use a gun or other dangerous weapon in the commission of a crime.', ""Third, I have proposed unprecedented funding for the Federal Government's Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, which provides equipment and training for local police officers."", 'Fourth, I have proposed tougher laws against drug pushers, for example, permitting judges to deny bail for defendants with a prior criminal record and imposing mandatory sentences for convicted pushers.', 'Fifth, I have proposed increasing the number of Federal judges to relieve the crowding of court dockets and to reduce the delay in bringing criminal cases to trial.', 'Sixth, I have recommended four new Federal prisons to relieve overcrowded or inhumane conditions in our penal system and to give judges no reason to keep convicted criminals out of jail.', 'Seventh, I have initiated a career criminal program in 12 key cities throughout America, and it will be 100 cities by 1978. This program, which began last year, identifies habitual criminals, sets up special prosecution procedures, and in 95 percent of the cases, results in conviction and in prison sentences that average more than 20 years.', 'We have also established a Public Integrity Section within the Justice Department to discover and prosecute official corruption. Furthermore, my administration is now devoting more resources to combat white collar crime than any other administration in history.', 'Most important, I have asked for a new, active spirit of cooperation from you, the American people, to help us defeat our common enemy--crime.', 'I have promised America a new generation of freedom: the freedom to walk the streets in safety, to be secure in our homes and neighborhoods, to trust the honesty and integrity of public officials.', ""On July 4 we celebrated the first 200 years of America's history. On November 2, with your help, we will begin a new generation of freedom for all Americans.""]"

Al, thank you.', 'A very dear friend of mine and a great person who was born and brought up right here in St. Louis has been traveling with me for the last 10 days. Unfortunately, he had a prior commitment that prevented him from coming here to St. Louis. But I have gotten to know, I think, one of the most fabulous people in this whole country. Do any of you remember of the name of Joe Garagiola?', 'Joe has taken about 10 days of his time and is out campaigning on behalf of Jerry Ford and Bob Dole. The other day we were flying from someplace to someplace, and Joe and I were sitting and I was listening to those wonderful stories that he tells about baseball. I was a rookie baseball player that never made it. Joe was telling of not only some baseball stories, and then we got to talking about St. Louis, and he was telling how he was brought up here in a wonderful Italian neighborhood.', '""Today,"" Joe said, ""I can\'t be with you, but will you say hello to Father Saul Paulevy for me,"" who did such a wonderful job in retaining the character and the integrity of that neighborhood where Joe was brought up. So, I say to you on behalf of Joe Garagiola: ""Hi.""', ""But we have some awfully fine congressional candidates here that I would like to recognize. We want Jack Danforth in the United States Senate, but we also--and this is very important--want Joe Badarocco in the House of Representatives. We sure would like Joe Frappier in the House of Representatives. Bob Witherspoon would be very helpful. Then I know you have a first-class candidate in Bob Snyder. Let's make sure that Missouri makes that kind of an affirmative contribution to a better Congress that will be sworn in on January 3."", 'Now, if I could take just a few minutes to express my deepest appreciation for this tremendous gathering here in front of the old courthouse, and to indicate to you that I have kept the pledge that I made when we left Kansas City. I said I would campaign every State, I would not concede a single vote, I would not concede a single State. And the net result is, we have campaigned the length and the breadth of this country. We were 33 points behind in August, and right now we have the momentum, and we are going to win on November 2.', 'Let me extend an invitation on behalf of Betty and myself to all of you--all of you, even some of those good Carter people out there--[laughter]--I extend an invitation to every one of you to come to Washington on January 20 and see Jerry Ford and Bob Dole inaugurated President and Vice President.', 'Let me tell you why we are going to win. Take just a minute to refresh your memory back to August of 1974. We had a troubled country. America was in turmoil. People were mad and angry with one another. They had lost their faith in, actually, our government. We were suffering inflation of over 12 percent. We were on the brink of the worst economic recession in 40 years. We were still involved in a tragic war in Vietnam.', ""I became President on August 9. It wasn't a happy day, but I had faith in the American people, I had faith in our form of government, and I decided that we had to keep the ship of state on an even keel, that we had to set a steady and firm course. You know, because our people responded--all of you in St. Louis and Missouri, all over the country--you rejoined me in that faith, that trust, that confidence."", 'Today, I think the American people, whether they agree with me on every issue, believe that the man in the White House can be trusted, that confidence has been restored in the Oval Office.', ""But we have also made great progress. Instead of inflation at 12 percent, the latest figures are 4.4 percent. That's headway. Yes, we had a recession. Unemployment was too high; employment was dropping. But again, the American people recognized that quick fixes and phony programs are not the solution, are not the solution to make America healthy and prosperous. And because we moved steadily and progressively forward, today we have 4 million more people working than we had 18 months ago, and that is progress."", 'We have 88 million people working in America, an all-time high. But I make a pledge to you. I am not satisfied with the unemployment we still have, but I will promise you that President Jerry Ford will not be satisfied until every person who wants a job has a job, period.', ""But I am also very, very proud to say--and look each and every one of you in the eye and say--isn't this great that there is not a single young American fighting or dying on foreign soil today? And we are at peace because America is number one militarily, and we are going to stay that way under President Ford. We are not going to cut and slash and gut the Defense Department. We want the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Marines to have the kind of military hardware so that they can deter aggression, that they can protect our national security, that they can give to the President the kind of strength that makes it possible for him to negotiate from strength with our adversaries, and to stand with our allies, and put together this free world so it can stand against aggression and stand for freedom and liberty for all people throughout the world."", ""As I look around this great audience, there are some wonderful people here, and I suspect most of you fall in what is called the middle-income class. You should be proud of that. We are proud that America has a middle-income class, because they are the strength, the real life-blood of American society. But the middle-income people in the last 10 years have been shortchanged under Federal taxes. Last January, I made a proposal to the Congress that would have remedied that situation. I recommended that the Congress increase the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000. That's a one-third increase."", 'And I was out to a factory the other day talking to some people, and one of the men said, ""Well, what would that do to me if Congress passed it?"" I said, ""How many kids do you have?"" He said, ""I have three."" So, it turns out to be a family of five. I said, ""If Congress had been smart enough they would have done what President Ford recommended, and then next April when you have to fill out your income tax return, you would have had $1,250 mare in personal exemption.""', ""Well, the Congress was irresponsible, unresponsive, and they didn't do it. Next January, I am going to put that same proposal on their desk, and if they don't pass it, I will put it on their desk the next January, in 1978, and if they don't pass it then, will you help me beat them in the next election in 1978?"", ""The best tax reform that I know is tax reduction, and the kind of a tax reduction program I recommended is meaningful. It will help 50 percent of the American taxpayers when they need it. So, let's make sure that instead of the kind of talk that I hear from my opponent, where one day he says he might give a tax reduction, the next day he says he isn't sure--you can count on President Ford to be on your side to reduce taxes in 1977."", 'Let me conclude with this observation: This election, in 3 days, will determine the direction of this country not only for the 4 years but for the next 100 years, which is our third century of American history.', 'Our forefathers, 200 years ago, drafted the most wonderful document for the governing of people in the history of mankind, and on July 4 of this year, we celebrated our 200th birthday. You had celebrations the length and the breadth of America. I was privileged to go to Valley Forge and to see where the straggling army of George Washington fought that battle. I was privileged to be in Philadelphia where it all began. I was privileged to be in New York City to see those ""Tall Ships"", where countries from all over the world came to pay respect to the greatest country in the history of mankind.', 'Out of that wonderful birthday celebration, America had a rebirth of spirit, a restoration of confidence, and a feeling that America was on the move. We can keep it on the move if you do your job on November 2, 1976.', 'I have been honored to be your President for the last 2 years, through the tough, difficult times we have had. I have nothing but the highest aspirations for all of you who kept your cool and stayed with us during those tough times.', 'I would be honored to be your President in the next 4 years, and I would be so pleased, I would be so proud, if you would tell me, ""Jerry, you have done a good job, keep right on doing it.""', 'Thank you very much.']"

Whether I'm in California or St. Louis, Missouri or Syracuse, New York or New York City, Jack Javits is out there fighting for the principles that we believe in. And I thank you from the bottom of my heart, Jack."", ""It's great to see Bob McEwen. You know, long before some of you were born, I used to go up skiing in Lake Placid, and I look forward to going to the Winter Olympics in Lake Placid as your President in 1980. I know Bob McEwen will be your Congressman at that time, too. But Bill Walsh, former great mayor of this city of Syracuse, when I was in the House as the minority leader, Bill did a super job. And for your benefit, for the country's benefit, let me say you darn well better send Bill Walsh back to Congress."", ""Then I owe a special debt of gratitude to Dick Rosenbaum. He did a tremendous job and significantly helped me have the opportunity of representing our party in this great campaign. And I thank you very much, Dick.

Joe, in front of these great people from Syracuse and upper New York, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. You know we're in the last quarter or we're in the ninth inning. That's when you win. That's when Dolph Schayes1 used to win for you here in Syracuse, that's when Joe Garagiola pulled it through, and that's when Jerry Ford is going to win this election on November 2."", ""I said in Kansas City that I wouldn't concede a single State, I wouldn't concede a single vote, and we haven't.

Betty and Jerry Ford invite you to the inauguration on January 20, 1977."", 'You know, as we come to the final countdown, and that is where we really are, I think you know but I want to reemphasize it--I stand on your side for limited government, for fiscal responsibility, for rising prosperity, for lower taxes, for military strength, and for peace in the world.', ""I am the first President to seek election since Dwight D. Eisenhower who can go to the American people and say America is at peace. And I remind you that not a single young American is fighting or dying on foreign soil tonight and they won't under the Ford administration."", ""But as we talk about things that are good, things that we have done, I can't help but let my mind drift back to 26 months ago when I became your President and stood in the East Room of the White House--never having sought election as President--becoming President under the most unusual circumstances, but I found that this country was in tough shape at that time."", 'Unemployment was beginning to rise. We were on the brink of a serious recession. Inflation was over 12 percent. The American people had lost faith and confidence and trust in the White House itself. We were still engaged in Vietnam. It was a tough and troubled country.', 'But as I stood there and took the oath of office and then had a few words to say, I said, ""Although you have not selected me by your ballots, I hope you will confirm me with your prayers."" And over the long sweep of 26 months, those prayers have helped. We put the ship of state on a steady keel. We had a firm and commonsense hand at the tiller, and the net result is we made substantial progress. We have cut the rate of inflation by more than half. We have gained 4 million jobs in the last 18 months. We have 88 million people gainfully employed in this country, an all-time high. And I think we have restored honor and trust and confidence in the White House by being frank, forthright, talking straight from the shoulder. I don\'t believe in promising more than I can produce, and I believe in producing everything that I promise.', ""But we've got a long way to go. I'm not satisfied. I won't be satisfied until every American who wants a job will have a job. We can do it in the next 4 years. I won't be satisfied until every young American, with his wonderful wife, can afford to buy a house in a decent neighborhood because that's the bulwark of our society--a home where you raise fine children, where you live in security and safety. And we are going to make it possible by lowering down payments, by adjusting mortgage payments, and by lowering the problems of inflation. We are going to give this new spirit to the younger generation on the one hand and the building industry on the other. That's a goal of our next 4 years."", ""As I look around this wonderful hall tonight, I see some of what are sometimes called our senior citizens. We owe them a special obligation. They have built the America that we live in today. Your parents and my parents and all of our grandparents, what a great country they have given us. So, as they live in their retirement, they should have our full and total support. They shouldn't have to worry about the problems of inflation, even though they live mainly on fixed incomes. That's the principal reason we have an obligation to put a restraint on the increase in Federal expenditures, because the best way to beat inflation is to cut Federal expenditures."", ""But we also owe them the opportunity of the best medical care that is obtainable in America, and we have the best. Everybody in this room knows a family, maybe your own, where somebody has had an extended illness with terrible medical and hospital costs. It's a catastrophe for the individual and for the family. We owe an obligation that no person among our senior citizens should go broke just to get well."", 'Among the other things that involve quality of life in America is the finest education. We have the teachers and the administrators and the facilities and, believe me, under this administration, we will make a maximum effort to make sure that quality education, with control at the local level, exists under the Ford administration.', ""Nobody in this country can feel safe unless we do something effectively about crime in America. We have made significant progress in the last 2 years in reducing the rate of crime, but I'm not satisfied, nor are you. There are two programs that must be implemented: The hardened career criminal who is a repetitive individual in robbing or stealing must go to jail, and that person must stay in jail."", 'Then, let me talk for just a minute about taxes. In January of last year, I submitted to the Congress a sound tax reduction program. The best tax reform that I know is tax reduction for the middle-income taxpayers. The middle-income taxpayers have been shortchanged, and so I recommended to the Congress last January that we increase the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000.', 'The other day I was out talking to some workers in a plant and one of the men said, ""What have you done to give me some tax relief?"" I said, ""How many children do you have?"" He said, ""I have got three."" It ended up he had a wife, three children, and himself. I said, ""If the Congress had been responsible, if the Congress had done the right thing and followed the recommendations that I made to give a fair break to the middle-income taxpayers, they would have accepted, approved, my increase of $750 to $1,000 for the middle-income taxpayers with a personal tax exemption.', ""Now, what did that mean to that family of five--$1,250 more in personal exemption. That's a lot of dough to a family that's trying to make it with a new house, send kids to school, improve their own status in society."", 'And that gentleman said to me, ""Well, supposing Congress doesn\'t pass it next time?"" I said, ""When they get back in January, they are going to have it on their desk. And if they don\'t pass it in 1977, then we will submit it in 1978, and if they don\'t pass it in 1978 to give you the kind of tax relief that you deserve, we will go out and beat them in the 1978 election.""', ""So, when you come right down to it, we've got peace, we're on the move to prosperity, and we have restored trust. So, in every field, America is on the move. The Nation is sound. The Nation is secure. This Nation is on the way to a better quality of life."", 'I say to you, my record is one of progress, not platitudes; performance, not promises. We have our problems, but I think we are making the kind of headway that gives us pride in America.', 'So, I say to you, on November 2--it has been tough the last 2 years, but I have been proud to be your President in a period when adversity almost overcame us, when difficulties were awesome. But because you supported me, because our form of government worked, because America is great, it was a privilege to be your President. But now, as skies get brighter, I ask you to give me an opportunity. I would be highly honored to serve as your President for the next 4 years.', ""We had a magnificent Bicentennial. There was a rejuvenation of the American spirit. There was a rebirth of our faith. So, I would look forward to representing you, to doing the best I could, and I pledge that to you.

That day that I became President--obviously, I will never forget--but that day we were on the brink of the worst recession. Inflation was over 12 percent. Americans had lost faith in their country, had lost faith in the White House. We were still deeply involved in Vietnam. There was anger; there was division among the American people.', ""And as I took that oath of office, standing in the East Room with Betty at my side, I said I had not been elected by your ballots; I asked to be confirmed by your prayers.

But let me make a commitment to each and every one of you. I won't be satisfied until we win the battle against inflation 100 percent, period."", ""Yes, we have gone through a serious recession, the worst in 40 years.

I won't be satisfied until every person who wants to work has a job. And I pledge to you that will be our goal and we will make it in the next 4 years."", 'I think the record is clear that we have restored the trust of the American people in the White House itself. I have been open, I have been candid, I have been frank, I have been forthright. And I again make a solemn pledge to each and every one of you that in the next 4 years, you can trust the President who has been open, frank, honest with you in the last 2 years.

We have an Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines that are number one, and we are going to keep them number one under Jerry Ford."", 'I know from my experience in the White House that to keep the peace we have we must remain strong. That will encourage our allies; it will warn our adversaries. And that peace, that came so hard, is a peace we can keep because we are united in America.', 'The Congress is now supporting the kind of defense budget that will buy us the best weapons, give us the best military personnel. Because of our military strength and our diplomatic skill, America has the peace, and we are going to keep it so that we can live a better quality of life here at home, a quality of life with peace and freedom.', 'But what does that mean? It means that we have to stimulate the economy, and the best way to do that is by a tax reduction. The best tax reform I know is tax reduction.', 'Last January, when the Congress reconvened, I submitted to them a tax reduction program that would have done two things: One, it would have increased your personal exemption from $750 to $1,000.', 'The other day, I was in a factory talking to a group of working people, and one of the men said, ""Well, how are you going to reduce my taxes?"" I looked him right in the eye and I said, ""How many children do you have?"" He said, ""Three."" So, he had himself, his wife, and three children.

I pledge that to you right here in Orchard Valley, Bucks County--Oxford. Let me apologize to Oxford Valley. [Laughter] We were in the right county, anyhow.

And the net result is, we have restored confidence in the White House because your President has been open, candid, straightforward, and I will do the same for the next 4 years.', ""We decided that the way to whip inflation was to reduce Federal spending, to reduce the rate of growth of Federal spending, and we have. Inflation, instead of being 12 percent--the last figure, 4.4 percent. That's progress."", 'We were able to end our involvement in Vietnam. And I am proud to say to all of you in Houston and the other wonderful Texans, that not a single American is fighting or dying on foreign soil today. We are strong and free because we have the finest Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines in the whole world, and we are going to keep it that way.', ""Mentioning our national security, there's a distinct difference, as John Connally said, between my position and that of my opponent. I believe that our defense must be fully funded so we can buy the most sophisticated, the most modern weapons--number one, to keep the peace through strength and, number two, to meet any challenge by any adversary from any place in the world. And under my administration today--and in the future--America will be number one."", ""In contrast, my opponent says today he would cut $5 to $7 billion out of the defense bill. A year ago, he said he would reduce it by $15 billion. In either case, any such reduction in national defense funding would be gambling with the security of the United States today and in the future, and we won't let that happen."", ""We're going to keep our Nation strong to meet any challenge, to get the respect from our allies. But we must also keep America strong here at home. Yes, we have gone through the worst recession in 40 years. But because of the character of the American people, because of our dedication to the free enterprise system, we are on the verge of the kind of prosperity that we'll have under this administration during the next 4 years."", 'But this brings up the distinct differences between President Ford on the one hand and my opponent on the other hand. I believe the best way to stimulate our economy, to provide jobs for everybody who wants a job, is to give tax reductions to the individual, particularly the middle-income taxpayer, and to give a tax reduction to industries so they can have an incentive to expand their plants, to build new plants, so that jobs for more Americans will be in the private economy, not dead end jobs that Jimmy Carter wants to give them out of the Federal Treasury.', 'Over 50 percent of the taxpayers in this country today fall in what we are proud to say is ""middle America."" I proposed last January a tax reduction that would give to the middle-income taxpayer the kind of tax relief that he deserves. The best tax reform that I know is tax reduction. I submitted to the Congress a proposal that made a lot of sense and would have given the kind of relief that you would appreciate. I recommended that we increase the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000.', 'Congress, unfortunately--and I think irresponsibly--rejected that proposal. I was talking to a worker in a plant just a week or so ago, and he said, ""Well, what will you do about my taxes?"" I said I had proposed a tax reduction that would be meaningful to him. I asked how many children did he have. He said he has three. It turned out he had a wife, three children. and himself. I said, ""If Congress had done the right thing by you and millions like you, when you have the opportunity to fill out your tax return next April, you would have had $1,250 more in personal exemptions."" He said, ""Gosh, how could the Congress be so irresponsible?""', ""So, I made a pledge to him, and I will make the same pledge to each of you. When Congress gets back next January, they will have on their desks a proposal to increase that personal exemption. I hope they are responsible in 1977 to give that kind of tax relief, but if they aren't, we will repeat it in 1978 when they reconvene. But then, if they don't pass it by the next election, we will go out and beat them, because the American people need that kind of tax relief."", 'So, as we look as to what the issues are between now and November 2, each one of you--and millions like you all over the country--have a very crucial decision to make. If you believe in strength at home, strength abroad, if you believe in the kind of an America that has taken us from 3 million people 200 years ago to a nation of 50 States and 215 million Americans, if you believe in the principles that have made America so great that we are envied by adversaries and allies around the world, you will vote for Jerry Ford and Bob Dole.', 'America has made an incredible comeback in the last 26 months. We have made it because of the character of people like yourselves. We have made it because we believe in the free enterprise system. We have made it because of the Constitution that was given to us by our forefathers, the greatest document in the history of mankind.', 'Yes, as I said on that day, August 9, 1974, I had not been confirmed by your ballots, but I have since been supported by your prayers. Now I can ask you on Tuesday, November 2, to not only support me by your prayers but to support me by your ballots.', 'Thank you very, very much.']"

And if we can win this election, and I am just as confident tonight as I have ever been in the old enthusiasm and momentum, then we hope to make the effort to try and build the Republican Party in all 50 States so that we can have a party in every State just like the fine party organization leadership and results that you have in Nassau County.', ""We have the right principles.

He is a great guy, a tremendous friend of mine. I would like Joe Garagiola to come up.', 'Let me speak very seriously with you for a few minutes. We are on the final moments, the countdown of probably the most crucial election in the lifetime of most of us here. A very important decision has to be made between now and next Tuesday when those polls close. I happen to believe that with the momentum we have going, with the performance that we have had, with the vision that we see, with the enthusiasm that I find in northern New York, here in Long Island, or any place else in this country, I think we are going to win that election good on November 2.', 'All right now listen carefully. On behalf of Betty and myself, I invite you all to come on down to that inauguration on January 20.', 'All right, let me tell you why you can go out and talk to your friends between now and November 2, and give them a real sales pitch that should convince them that the Ford-Dole ticket ought to win. Let me give you a quick review of where we were on August 9, 1974 when I took the oath of office in the White House.', 'America was in trouble. Inflation was 12 percent; we were on the brink of a recession; we were still involved in Vietnam; the American people had lost faith and trust in the White House itself. And as I took the oath of office in the East Room of the White House and Betty held the Bible, I pledged to you that I would uphold the Constitution, that I would do right as God gave me the right to see what we should do. And then afterwards, I said I had not been elected by your ballots but I had been confirmed, I hoped, with your prayers. And, believe me, as those tough months went ahead--and they were difficult-I knew that the American people were praying for me to give them the leadership, to give them the strength to come out of the difficult times that we went through.', 'We put the ship of state on a steady course; we put it on an even keel. And we have made incredible progress in the last 2 years. Yes, we have cut the rate of inflation by more than 50 percent, and I pledge to you we will do even better in the next 4 years.', 'We have added 4 million jobs in the last 17 months. We have 88 million people gainfully employed. But, I pledge to you I will not be satisfied until we have a job for every American who wants a job in the next 4 years.', 'We have restored confidence and trust in the Oval Office in the White House. I have done it by being open, candid, frank, straightforward, and let me assure you that in the next 4 years we will do just as well because the American people want to believe their President. And they can believe President Ford.', ""I am honored that I am the first President since Dwight D. Eisenhower who can seek election and say to the American people, our great country is at peace, and we are going to keep it that way. There isn't a single young American fighting or dying on any foreign soil tonight. And we are at peace because America is strong. We are strong militarily. We have the finest weapons, the best leadership. We have the greatest capability to deter aggression, to meet any challenge."", 'I have been able to turn the Congress around and convince them that their President, if he is dealing with our allies on the one hand, they feel strengthened; or if he is dealing with our adversaries, they respect him. And I pledge to you that we are going to keep the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Marines number one during the next 4 years. But that requires that we buy the best weapons systems, not for war but to maintain peace.', 'But I want to thank the people of Nassau County for their contribution. You have in the Grumman Company one of the finest performers with the F-14 and other weapons systems.', 'So, we have trust, we have peace, we have growing prosperity. But now, what other things must we do? Number one, we have to keep our economy moving in the right direction, and here is an area where there is a difference between myself on the one hand and my opponent on the other.', 'From the very beginning--in fact, in January of last year, I recommended to the Congress that we ought to have a tax reduction primarily aimed at helping the middle-income taxpayer who has been given short change in the last 10 years. I recommended that we ought to increase the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000.', 'A few weeks ago I was going through a plant, stopped and talked to some of the working people, and one of the men said, ""What are you going to do about my Federal taxes?"" I said to him, ""Well, I recommended to the Congress that they bump up your personal exemption."" I said, ""How many kids do you have? .... Oh,"" he said, ""I have three."" I said, ""You have your wife, three children, and yourself."" I said, ""If the Congress had acted responsibly, if the Congress had done what they should have done, next April when you were making out your income tax return you could have claimed $1,250 more on your income tax return.""', 'I said, ""Ask your Congressman is he going to follow President Ford, or is he going the other direction if Carter should happen to get in the White House."" Because Jimmy Carter--and I asked all these wonderful press people, can they find out where Jimmy Carter stands on taxes. I bet there isn\'t one of those newspaper or other news media people who could sit down and give a straight story on where Jimmy Carter stands on taxes.', ""So, here is a clear choice. You have President Ford, who wants to reduce your personal income taxes, who wants to give industry a break so that it can expand, it can modernize, it can do the things that produce jobs for you. That is where I stand. Well, Jimmy Carter, he's up and down."", 'But, there are some other things that I think now that we are over the hump after the tough 2 years we have had, I pledge to you that in the next 2 to 4 years, with the help of the Congress, that I am going to give us an opportunity to have a quality of life in America that we have never had heretofore. We are going to have a job for everybody who wants to work. We are going to have a home for every young couple that wants to work and save and buy a home in a decent neighborhood. That is a pledge to you.', 'We are going to have quality education. We are going to have health care that is affordable, the best in the world. We are going to see to it that the criminal element in this country goes into prison and the victims of crime are protected.', 'We are going to improve the quality of life. We are going to make the water that you drink pure, the air that you breathe clean. We are going to improve the environment of our whole United States so that we can live in the kind of an atmosphere that is good for all of us.', 'And so as this great campaign nears its finish, I just know that Nassau County is going to make a tremendous effort and produce results. I was glad to hear what Joe said. With those kind of figures we will carry New York, and with this kind of enthusiasm I know we will get those figures.', 'One final word: I leave New York with the kind of enthusiasm that I am sure that other successful candidates for the Presidency have felt as they have been to rallies like this one.', 'Yes, I have been proud to be your President during a period of 2 tough years, but with your help and with your faith and with your determination, it will be a great honor for me to serve as your President for the next 4 years. Our forefathers have given us a tremendous history and we should all be deeply grateful.', 'But now it is our responsibility, everybody, to write the history of the third century, and I pledge to you, as the President for the next 4 years, that we will write that history so historians can look back and say we did a good job in starting off the first 4 years of our third century.', 'America is respected. All of you here recall on July 4 when we celebrated our 200th birthday, those ""Tall Ships"" that came from all over the world to pay respect to the number one nation in the history of mankind, the United States of America.', 'And now I ask you on November 2 not only to confirm me with your prayers but to confirm me with your ballots, and I pledge to you that I will not let youdown.', 'Thank you, and good night.']"

We are not quite clear where you are aiming to lead America.""', 'So today, I want to talk with you about my concerns and my hopes for America as we enter our third century.', 'My vision of America is a nation that is strong and good, a nation that feels the need for constant improvement, a nation whose people care about each other and want to retain their own special sense of identity. Beyond that--a nation in which basic human rights are respected and maintained: the right to speak our minds; the right to choose the men and women who enact and enforce our laws; the right to stand equal before the law, regardless of sex, race, or religion; the right to bargain freely in the economic marketplace; the right to worship as we choose.', ""We have been through a lot in recent years--a war, a recession, runaway inflation, riots, scandals--a collection of troubles that shook America's confidence and left our people exhausted. In the past 2 years, I have done my best to put America back on even keel, to chart a steady course for the future."", ""America has had its heart broken too many times when grand promises went unfulfilled. We have learned through painful experience that when those frustrations cannot be held inside any more, our society explodes in violence and fear. That is why it is so important that those who would lead this country be honest enough to promise only what they know they can deliver, to admit that some problems can't be solved by waving a magic wand, or creating still another government program, or even by changing an administration. The answer lies not in making government bigger, but in making it serve us better in assuming more responsibilities for ourselves."", 'This Nation was not built on comfort, but on sacrifice; not on a maze of government programs, but on the strength and vitality of a free, self-reliant people.', 'We can improve the quality of life in America. We can improve education and health care. We can have comfortable, affordable homes in safe, decent neighborhoods. We can have clean air and water. We can create more parks and recreational facilities. We can care for those who need our help. We can keep America strong and at peace.', ""These are all worthy goals, and the government can help reach them all. But the government can't do everything. If it tries to do too much, it ends up doing nothing very well. If it assumes too much power and control, we will have sown the seeds of our own destruction as a free people. I would never let government grow so big or so strong that it can take away our freedom. I would not allow our people to grow so dependent on government that they would lose the incentive to develop their own creativity, generosity, and initiative. When a government solution is needed, I would make government respond at the level closest to the problem."", 'That is my vision of America: a vision of limited government and unlimited opportunity; a commitment to common sense and common progress.', ""On July 4, we celebrated the first 200 years of America's history. On November 2, with your help, we will begin a new generation of freedom for all Americans.""]"

It is nice to be back in Michigan.', 'Within hours after I received the nomination in Kansas City, I told Betty that I would open this campaign at home.

Thank you for all that you have done for me the past 28 years.', 'I said in my acceptance speech, the speech to the American people, it is from your ranks that I come and on your side that I stand. There is no place on the Earth where that statement is more true than among all of you here in Michigan today.', 'I am the first son of Michigan to serve as President of the United States. I am part of this great State, its people, and its belief in America.

I know you will support me as you always have. May I tell you how important that really is? Someone once said you can tell a lot about a man by the way his family feels about him.

Jim, I can't express deeply enough my gratitude and appreciation for your loyalty. But let me add this one feature. We have on the stage with me today the two greatest Governors in the history of Ohio."", 'But it is great to be in Akron, Canton, Massillon, and Alliance. What an area in the great State of Ohio.', ""I am honored to be on the team in Ohio with Bob Taft. Send him back to Washington for your good and for the country's good. Bob, you have got to win. And then you have your own Congressman in this area. He has done a super job, a fantastic job on your behalf, but a job for America. Send Ralph Regula back to help us."", 'And now let me speak straight from the shoulder. You have a chance to improve the quality of Congress by sending one of your own, Jim Houston, down to the House of Representatives.', ""But it is great to be here with Mayor Ballard, with Mayor Cmich.1 And then I want to thank somebody else who has taken time, along with others of equal prominence. Wayne,2 thank you very, very much. All over the country we have had outstanding people like Wayne participate voluntarily. We have had Peter Graves, Hugh O'Brien, Rod McKuen. We have had quality people who on their own have come out and said it is important for America that President Ford win. Wayne, I thank you very much."", 'Now there is one fellow that came down here along with his beautiful wife, and I want to thank Bill Stanton. Send Bill back to Congress.', 'But I mentioned a moment ago when I was speaking about your great Governor--and I said there were two great Governors on the platform this morning. And now it is my privilege to introduce to you a man who was a judge in Cleveland, a mayor of Cleveland, a Governor of Ohio, and an outstanding United States Senator, Frank Lausche.', ""You know I come from that State up north, but since 1963 I have been in the State of Ohio 56 times. That's not a bad record. I have been down to Canton on three occasions to the Football Hall of Fame, the football center of the United States. I never made it as a participant, but I respect and admire those outstanding men who have given us a great American sport. Congratulations, Jim."", 'With the help of Bob Taft, Ralph Regula, Bill Stanton, they got through the Cuyahoga National Park, the first national park in the history of the State of Ohio, and I was honored and pleased to sign that legislation.', 'As I said a moment ago, this is a crucial election. It will determine the course of events of this country, not only for the next 4 years but maybe, undoubtedly as I see it, the next century, our third century of American history. You know where I stand. I stand for lower taxes, a balanced budget, lower Federal spending, beating inflation, and peace and liberty for the United States of America. And in the last 2 years America has made incredible progress, and we are on our way, and we are going to make more in the next 4 years under Jerry Ford.', 'In Kansas City, I said we would not concede a single vote, we would not concede a single State. We want Ohio, and we are going to win Ohio.', 'And now let me extend a personal invitation from Betty and from me. We would love to have every one of you down to Inauguration Day on January 20, when Jerry Ford and Bob Dole are sworn in as President and Vice President.', 'There are many issues at stake in this election, but let me take two--one that means whether we have peace or a lack of security in this country; the other involves the health of our economy.', 'In the first debate, Mr. Carter said he would anticipate a $60 billion surplus in the Federal Treasury. He said that he would spend that $60 billion for a whole raft of new Federal programs. In that same debate, I said if there is a $60 billion surplus, I want a tax reduction for the American people.', 'President Ford is for the little taxpayer and President Ford is against the big tax spender. I have been firm; I have been consistent. The best tax reform is tax reduction. The middle-income taxpayer in this country--over 50 percent of us--have been shortchanged in the last 10 years by the actions of the Congress, and we are going to change it in the next session.', 'Mr. Carter, in the last 2 or 3 days, in discussing tax reduction, has said: Perhaps we will have a tax reduction--if we have a tax reduction. It is a clear distinction between him and President Ford. I have consistently, firmly, said the American people should and will have a tax reduction so we can stimulate the economy, so we can give you a better chance to spend that hard-earned cash that you deserve in your pocket and not in the Federal Treasury.', 'In January of this year, 1976, I submitted to the Congress a $28 billion tax reduction package. I said in order to do it honestly and conscientiously, the Congress had to go along with a $28 billion restraint in Federal spending. Included in my tax reduction proposal is the kind of tax reduction that is meaningful to the middle-income taxpayer. I recommended that we increase the personal exemption from $750--which it is today--to $1,000.', 'Let me tell you what that means. The other day I went through a plant and I was talking to some working men on a production line. And one of them said, ""President Ford, what does your tax reduction proposal mean to me and my family?"" I said, ""How many children do you have?"" He said, ""I have got three kids."" It turned out that he had himself, a wife, and three children. I said, ""Get out your pencil."" It means that if Congress had acted responsibly, we would have had for that man and millions and millions and millions of other taxpayers the opportunity next April to sit down and figure out in his case that he would have gotten $1,250 more in personal exemption, money that he could have spent for himself and his lovely family.', ""That's our tax proposal--tax reduction. And on January 3, when Congress reconvenes, they are going to have that tax reduction proposal on their desk, and if they don't pass it in 1977, we will send it right back up in 1978. And if that Congress doesn't pass it in 1978, you and I will go out and beat them in the next election in 1978."", 'But, there is another big difference. I am proud to stand before you and say that I am the first President since Dwight D. Eisenhower who can go to the American people to seek their support and say America is at peace. Under our administration--yours and mine--we have the finest Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines, and we are going to keep them number one.', ""Mr. Carter wants to cut the defense budget by $5 to $15 billion. That is too big a gamble for America's security. And I want to pledge to you that in the next 4 years we are going to keep America number one so we can preserve the peace, deter aggression, meet any challenge. That is the kind of defense program I stand for and you stand for and America stands for."", 'On August 9, 1974, I stood in the East Room of the White House and took an oath of office to be your President. I had not sought this high office. Betty held the Bible, and I placed my hand on it and I said afterwards--because America was troubled, we were divided, there was anger, there was division-after having taken the oath of office, I said, ""I know that you have not elected me by your ballots. I ask you that you confirm me with your prayers.""', 'And with the help of your prayers in the last 2 years, we have gone from inflation of over 12 percent to under 6 percent. With your help and support, we have come out of the worst recession in 40 years. With your help, we have restored trust and confidence in the White House, because I can look each and every one of you in the eye and say I have been candid, straightforward.', 'But most of all, I can stand here with pride and say with your help and, yes, your prayers, America is at peace, not a single young American is fighting or dying on any foreign soil today, and we will keep it that way for the next 4 years.', ""But now we come to the crucial 24 hours. How many of you can remember, I'm sure, in either Canton or Akron or Alliance or Massilion that on July 4 you had a wonderful celebration in honor of our 200th birthday? Our forefathers gave us the greatest document for the governing of people in the history of mankind. Our forefathers have given us the kind of a government that is good for freedom and liberty."", ""We celebrated what they gave to us, but now--beginning tomorrow--we have an opportunity not only to read history but to make history. So, we come down to the bottom line. I know America is on the move. America has a new fresh look. We are together. We are united.

Betty and I want all of you to come down to that inauguration on January 20 when Jerry Ford and Bob Dole are sworn in as President and Vice President.', 'Now let me introduce to you, for some remarks, a person well known to you, who was a judge here in the State of Ohio and Cleveland, who was your Governor-and one of the three greatest Governors in the history of Ohio--who was a United States Senator. And now it is my privilege to introduce a close, personal friend whose support I really appreciate--your former Senator, your former Governor, Frank Lausche.', '[At this point, Frank Lausche announced his support of President Ford.

We are counting on that Buckeye State to be with us tomorrow. With our momentum, let's do it, a home run."", ""I love that enthusiasm and applause, but take just a minute--let's hear a pin drop--because I want to talk about some of these, or at least two of the critical issues where I strongly differ with my opponent."", 'First, taxes. In the first debate my opponent said that we could anticipate a $60 billion surplus in the Federal Treasury. He said in that debate that he would spend that $60 billion for more programs, piling one on top of another. In that debate I said if there is a $60 billion surplus, I think it ought to go for a tax reduction to the middle-income taxpayer.', 'I can stand here and say with good conscience that President Ford stands for the little taxpayer and President Ford is against the big tax spender. Within the last several days Mr. Carter has been pressed. Does he want a tax reduction or not? He says, if, perhaps. President Ford has been on the line, talking straight from the shoulder saying, yes, the middle-income taxpayer has been shortchanged.', ""I recommended to the Congress in January that we ought to have a $28 billion tax reduction along side of a $28 billion restraint on Federal spending-for every tax dollar in reduction, a dollar reduced in the rate of growth of Federal spending. The Congress gave you half a loaf. They didn't go along with my proposal to increase the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000."", 'Now let me tell you what that means. It means that the middle-income taxpayer--50 percent of those that pay our taxes--would get, and let me illustrate it with an incident that happened: I was in a factory the other day, down a production line, and one of the men said to me, ""President Ford, where do you stand on taxes?"" I told him how I wanted to increase the personal exemption. I said, ""How many children do you have?"" He said, ""I have got three."" I said, ""If you have a wife, three children, and yourself, if Congress had acted responsibly, next April when you made out that income tax return, you would have had, under President Ford\'s tax reduction program, $1,250 more in personal exemption for you to spend and not have in the Federal Treasury.""', ""Now Congress didn't do it. But on January 3, when that next Congress convenes--and I want all of this good Ohio delegation back there to help me-I will have on their desk a tax reduction proposal that will include the increase in the personal exemption; it will increase jobs incentive legislation to help industry expand, to modernize. And if that Congress doesn't pass it in 1977, they will have it on their desk in January of 1978, and if they don't give that kind of decent, equitable tax reduction in 1978, I will join every one of you trying to beat them in that election in 1978."", ""But now let's talk about defense. Today the United States, with our Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines--we are number one. And under President Ford we are going to keep them number one. I have recommended appropriations so they will have the best weapons, the best leadership, the best training. That' is the way to keep the peace. And under President Ford, with the strength that we have, we will strengthen our alliances. We will be able to look our adversaries straight in the eye, and they will respect us."", ""But let me say, you make a great contribution in the city of Columbus, because in the recommendations that I made for a strong defense--and that is the way you keep the peace--that we have a B-1 bomber to replace those aging B-52's that are now 20 and 25 years old. If we don't get the B-1 bomber as an instrument of peace, the President in the next 5, the next 10 years, if we continue to rely on the B-52's, will be sending our young combat pilots to protect us in aircraft older than they are, and that is not going to happen under President Ford."", 'I am proud to stand before you and say that I am the first President since Dwight D. Eisenhower who can tell the American people that America is at peace. I am proud of the fact that not a single young American is fighting or dying on any foreign soil today. And we are at peace because the United States is strong. We are not at war because the United States is strong.', 'And let me say, wasn\'t it a great, great celebration on the Fourth of July when America celebrated its 200th birthday? I happened to have the privilege to fly over New York Harbor and see those ""Tall Ships"" coming in, representing many, many countries. And why did they come to the United States? Because they respect America. And we are proud of America, and we will continue to be proud of America.', 'But now as this great campaign comes to a conclusion, I have the feeling that we have reunited as a people. When I became President, people were angry, divided, disillusioned. I will never forget that day in the East Room of the White House when I put my hand on the Bible held by my wife, Betty, and took the oath of office when America was troubled.', 'Yes, we were in trouble. Inflation was over 12 percent. We were still involved in Vietnam. There was a loss of confidence in the White House itself. We were on the brink of the worst recession in 40 years. And after having taken the oath of office to be your President, I said, since you have not elected me by your ballots, I ask you to confirm me with your prayers.', 'With those prayers we put the ship of state on a steady keel. I had a firm, commonsense hand on the tiller, and we have made incredible progress in the last 2 years. We have cut inflation by better than 50 percent. We have added 4 million jobs; we have 88 million people working today, the most in the history of the United States. We are at peace, and we are going to keep the peace.', 'And I can say with pride to all of you and to my former colleagues in the Congress--Bob Taft, Sam Devine, Chalmers Wylie, Clarence Miller, Bud Brown, Bill Harsha, Willis Gradison--that we have restored that confidence in the White House. I have been open, candid, frank.', ""And now, as we come to the final quarter--in fact, the final minutes--of this great campaign, you have a critical decision to make tomorrow. It couldn't have been put better than the way Frank Lausche put it."", 'But let me add, I have been proud to be your President during troubled times. I want the opportunity to build on that firm foundation, to keep America moving.', ""Therefore, I ask when you go to the polls tomorrow that you not only confirm me with your prayers but you also confirm me with your ballots.

That would be a big gamble. I believe that the way to keep the peace is to keep strong, but in order to keep our domestic economy strong, we need additional tax reduction.', ""Last January I told the Congress they should cut your personal taxes. I think the best tax reform is tax reduction. I recommended that your personal exemption be increased from $750 to $1,000. Congress didn't do its job, but on January 3, when Congress comes back, I will have the tax reduction proposal on their desks so that they can give the middle-income taxpayer, who has been shortchanged, the kind of tax reduction that that group in our society so badly needs."", 'But, in addition, we have some other problems. We will do a better job in the next 4 years in making certain that the victims of crime are protected and that the criminal goes to jail. We will do a better job to help our older people, who have earned our respect and our support. We will do a better job in meeting some of the problems of our major metropolitan areas.', 'We have a lot of things to do, but we are in shape to do it now that we are over the hump of the tough last 2 years.', 'So, we come to the final round in this election.

After that was over and as I \'realized the troubled times we were in--with inflation over 12 percent, with America still involved in Vietnam, with us on the brink of the worst recession in 40 years, and trust and confidence in the White House gone--I made a few remarks to the American people. I said, among other things, ""I know that you have not confirmed me by your ballots, but I ask you to confirm me by your prayers.""', 'In those 2 tough years since August 9, we have made incredible progress in this great country. Reflect for a minute on our 200th birthday. It was a great occasion, where all over America we found that there was a new togetherness. We could disagree without being disagreeable. We could move forward as we have, shoulder to shoulder and arm in arm. That spirit is infectious, and America is on the move. I thought then--as I did on August 9--how wonderful the people of Michigan have been to give me the chance to serve not only Michigan but to serve the people of 50 States. Everything I have in politics comes from you, and I express my deepest appreciation and gratitude.', 'But now we have that crucial decision to make. America is respected. Some of you may have seen those ""Tall Ships"" in the harbor of New York. Ship after ship, from country after country, had come to pay respect to the greatest country in the history of mankind, the United States of America.', 'Now, between right this minute and 8 tomorrow night, you have that critical decision to make. Tomorrow, yes, you can confirm me by your prayers--and your prayers truly help--but now you have the opportunity to confirm me with your ballots. I ask for your support, and I promise you from the bottom of my heart I will not let you down.', 'Thank you very much.']"
156,Gerald R. Ford ,"November 01, 1976","['Would you please be very quiet for just a minute? I would hope that we might even hear a pin drop.', ""I don't think that I can adequately express in words tonight Betty's appreciation and mine for this tremendous welcome to the home that we love so much, Grand Rapids."", 'I have made a lot of speeches, and this is the hardest one to make, because as I look out in this audience and as I saw so many people as we came down Monroe Avenue--Democrats, Independents, Republicans--people that Betty and I lived with, that Betty and I love, that I tried to help over the years when I had the honor of representing this great congressional district, I could tell you some stories about how the tough problems came to our office. And we never asked the person that walked in that office whether he or she was a Democrat or a Republican. We said, what can we do to help you, and that is the way I want to be your President.', 'You know, those wonderful experiences over a period of time, of taking that trailer down through Ottawa County, Ionia County, Kent County, and sitting and listening to wonderful people who had a problem, who wanted to give me a little trouble, give me a hard time--and they did--but also we had a couple of friends that might come in and say nice things about us. But the wonderful experience of representing the Fifth Congressional District will be something that I will never forget, and I thank you for the opportunity.', 'You know, I had a speech I was going to make, but I threw it away. [Laughter]', 'But I have got a couple of friends that I would like to introduce to you and to suggest that you can help me if you help them. First, I would like to recommend, because I know him, because I know the job he has done in Congress, I would like to recommend to you that you vote tomorrow for Mary Esch for the United States Senate. Then I would equally say it would be very helpful to me as your next President if you would send Hal Sawyer to represent you here in the Fifth District.', 'As we came off the expressway, we went down College Avenue and Betty said, ""I went to Fountain School."" We went right by it. Then we went by Central High School, but then, you know, I said to her, ""Well, South High, that was a great school, too."" [Laughter]', 'But anyhow, Grand Rapids, Kent County, Ottawa County, Ionia, well, all of them--western Michigan can make the difference and this is what I want you to know and what I think it is all about tomorrow.', 'You know, on August 9, 1974, I was sworn in as your President. You know better than anybody in this country, I never sought the office, but circumstances put me in the position where I stood in the East Room of the White House. Betty held the Bible open; I put my hand on it. I took the oath of office at a tough time, when there had been a great loss of trust in the White House itself. We had high inflation. We were on the brink of a recession. We were still involved in Vietnam. But with some apprehension I walked over to the Oval Office. But before doing so, I said to all Americans, not just to you from here, that you had not elected me by your ballots, but I prayed that you would confirm me with your prayers. And you did.', ""We went through troubled times for the last 2 years. But because you stood with me, because you prayed with me, because you believed in America, because you had strength and faith--and 215 million other Americans--we have turned things around, and we see brighter skies, and we see greater opportunity. We see, as we saw on July 4, when there was a great spirit that was expressed in America, our 200th birthday, all of a sudden, Americans--Democrats, Independents, and Republicans--came to the conclusion that we not only could read history--and it was a great history--but more importantly, together, regardless of our political persuasion, we could write history for the third century of America's great history, and we will."", ""It is so nice to be back here where I see Bill Milliken, I see Bob Griffin, I see Bob VanderLaan,1 I see all the people that I grew up with, that Betty grew up with. You know, it is hard to express one's deep sentiments about a community and an area that has been so good to us."", 'So, as I conclude these totally prepared remarks--[laughter]--tomorrow each and every one of you have a great decision to make. I suspect it might be the right one.', 'Let me conclude with just this final comment: Betty and I have been honored to represent this part of the country--but all America--in the White House during the last 2 years, and they have been troubled, and they have been tough. But we kept the ship of state on the right course, and I tried to keep a firm, commonsense hand at the tiller. And the net result is, things have turned around. America has made incredible progress in the last 2 years. But we are just moving. We are going to get better. We are going to make America what our forefathers said it would be.', ""When I was sworn in, I asked for your prayers. I said you hadn't elected me. But tomorrow all of you in this great area of western Michigan can really decide the election. You can decide the election in Michigan."", ""In Kansas City I said I wouldn't concede a single vote, I wouldn't concede a single State--and I don't concede Michigan to the opposition. Western Michigan can turn the tide. Western Michigan can decide the fate of the next 4 years in this country. It will make the difference in Michigan. It will make the difference in the election."", ""And so, I say to you calmly, from the depth of my appreciation: Tomorrow, yes, I want your prayers for confirmation, but tomorrow I ask that you confirm me with your votes, and I won't let you down. I promise that."", 'Thank you.']"
157,Gerald R. Ford ,"November 02, 1976","[""In these last hours I'd like to share with you some personal thoughts about today's election. To all of us, the outcome is important, because the choice is final."", ""I believe I offer experienced leadership; you will have to decide whether my opponent can make the same claim. I think my approach could properly be called steady and dependable; it is my opinion that, even as I speak to you, his claims are unclear and untested. To single out just one issue, my course promises a lid on spending and a tax cut for every American family; Mr. Carter's approach shifts with the wind, leaving me with the feeling that we, the American people, could be left high and dry."", 'To stay on our steady and dependable course, I need your help; I need your vote. To me it is more than a choice between different approaches to government; it is the test of our political system, a test of the qualities we Americans seek in our leadership.', ""For these past 2 years I have been careful never to promise what I could not deliver. It has been my goal to inspire your confidence in America through solid performance rather than through mere words. And in these past 2 years I think America has come a long way back: We're at peace in our world, we have peace of mind here at home, inflation has been cut in half, we've set a peacetime record of 4 million new jobs in 17 months, and honor has been restored to the White House. I'm proud of that extraordinary comeback, and I think America should be too. You all did it. And I think we can be proud."", 'So now that our comeback has brought us to the threshold of a better quality of life, the choice is yours to make. I hope you will choose continued leadership. This is my fondest hope: to continue to serve the people of this country that has blessed me in so many ways.', 'The White House has affected every person ever to serve in it. Many have added to its wisdom. Some have succumbed to its power. Most have risen to its challenge. In my own case perhaps it is the unique conditions of my service that have most influenced my thoughts. Perhaps only one who came to the Presidency without being elected can care as deeply as I do to use that power without ever abusing your trust. Perhaps only one who has served as your President without your mandate can desire as strongly as I do to serve as your President with your mandate.', 'This election comes at the end of our second century and also at the beginning of what can be a new generation of freedom where individual Americans can know the blessings of freedom without the intrusions of a government trying to be all things to all people.']"
158,Gerald R. Ford ,"November 03, 1976","[""It is perfectly obvious that my voice isn't up to par, and I shouldn't be making very many comments, and I won't. But I did want Betty, Mike, Jack, Steve, Susan, and Gayle to come down with me and to listen while Betty read a statement that I have sent to Governor Carter. I guess Ron1 has told you that I called him."", 'But I do want to express on a personal basis my appreciation and that of my family for the friendship that all of us have had. And after Betty reads the statement that was sent to Governor Carter by me, I think all of us--Betty, the children, and myself--would like to just come down and shake hands and express our appreciation personally.', 'Let me call on the real spokesman for the family. Betty.', 'Mrs. Ford. The President asked me to tell you that he telephoned President elect Carter a short time ago and congratulated him on his victory.', ""The President also wants to thank all those thousands of people who worked so hard on his behalf and the millions who supported him with their votes.

I congratulate you on your victory.', 'As one who has been honored to serve the people of this great land, both in Congress and as President, I believe that we must now put the divisions of the campaign behind us and unite the country once again in the common pursuit of peace and prosperity.', 'Although there will continue to be disagreements over the best means to use in pursuing our goals, I want to assure you that you will have my complete and wholehearted support as you take the oath of office this January.', 'I also pledge to you that I, and all members of my Administration, will do all that we can to insure that you begin your term as smoothly and as effectively as possible.', 'May God bless you and your family as you undertake your new responsibilities.', 'Signed, ""Jerry Ford.""', 'Thank you very much.']"
