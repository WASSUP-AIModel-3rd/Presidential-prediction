0,Jimmy Carter ,"September 10, 1977","['Good afternoon, everybody. I\'m glad to be here. The last time I was near the ""burg,"" I was on a train and I was hungry and I had a great horseshoe made out of bread delivered to me at the train station from the ""burg,"" and I do appreciate the good food and the expression of friendship.', 'I understand this is the home of some of the greatest pizzas in the world. Or as we say in Italian, tomato pies. [Laughter]', ""And also, of course, this great city of Trenton is the home of a President who was an inspiration to me and to many others. As you know, Woodrow Wilson lived for a while and practiced law in Georgia, and he began his own political career at a rally and an endorsement back there at the old Taylor Opera House, which I understand is now a parking lot. And I hate to say that Plains, my hometown, is becoming a parking lot as well. But I think there's a lot that ties us together. My own family came to this country, my ancestor, as an indentured servant."", ""I was talking to Brendan Byrne on the way here from Newark this morning, and his parents arrived about 100 years ago. One of his grandfathers worked in the Stetson Hat Company. Another one was a caretaker and a gardener who worked for the wealthy people in the Orange area. And I know many of you and your families have come here from other European countries. This is a sign of two things: One, the strength of our Nation depends upon this diversification, the fact that we are different. We are proud of the differences that exist between us, but we all fit in together to comprise Americans. And that's what makes us have the greatest nation on Earth."", ""I've done a lot of campaigning in the last couple of years. And as I came down the street behind me and shook hands, I noticed a special thing. Quite often everybody rushes forward and reaches out to grab my hand. But down the street behind me, I noticed that almost every parent stepped back and pushed their little child forward to reach out and shake the President's hand, and I think that's a good sign."", ""The first time I heard of Brendan Byrne was a little more than 4 years ago. I was Governor of Georgia in 1973, and I began to hear radio programs and see on television about a man from New Jersey that couldn't be bought. And I became interested in him. And I came up to help him raise money and to help him plan his campaign for Governor of your State."", ""There is a characteristic about politicians that's important, and Brendan Byrne has these characteristics. One is courage. Now, I know that one of the most unpopular things that a Governor can do is to change the tax program of a State. This change was made because of the courage of Brendan Byrne."", 'I think this is becoming recognized, as the months go by, as an unpopular step at the beginning, but as people get more and more acquainted with the consequences and results of the income tax, they begin to like it more and more.', ""Mayor Holland just told me that it had been possible for him to lower property taxes in Trenton more than 40 percent. Another thing that I've learned is that retired families have an average property tax rebate of $240 a year."", ""This kind of tax change is good for both the poor people, the retired people, but primarily for the working people of New Jersey. Eighty-five percent of the retired citizens of New Jersey pay zero State taxes, and at the same time, you've been able to add to better schools for your children more than $500 million. So, what turned out at first to be an unpopular and a courageous decision is now beginning to be known as the proper thing to do."", ""I'd like to make one other comment about that. When you come down to a choice between high property taxes on the one hand, high sales taxes on the one hand, and the richer people in the State begin to pay their share of taxes, the choice for working families is very clear. And that choice is that Brendan Byrne, with the help of many of you, did the right thing last year."", ""I'm also glad to see this community restore--I believe last year--your celebration of the Festival of Lights. It's important for us to preserve not only our family heritage in countries in Europe and other places but, also, the commitment that we have to our own religions."", 'This is a festival that started more than 150 years ago. But I want to be sure that 100 years from now we still preserve these fine attributes that remind us of our backgrounds, our present and, also, our future. It ties us together, it\'s an enlightening thing, and also, I have understanding, at least in the ""burg"" it\'s a very enjoyable thing, because you have a festival every night for a week.', ""I'd like to comment on a couple of other things quite frankly with you. The first time I came to New Jersey to campaign, I have to tell you in complete frankness, that there was not a very good, hopeful spirit about the future. We have seen in the last 4 years some very quiet but very significant changes take place in your own life."", ""When Brendan Byrne became Governor of New Jersey, New Jersey ranked 49th in the amount of your Federal tax money that came back to your State for better education, better housing, better transportation, better law enforcement, and other programs that help your families--49th. Even when we had a Republican administration, there was great progress made with Frank 'Thompson, other members of the congressional delegation working with Brendan Byrne."", ""And now, New Jersey ranks 34th in getting back your tax money that you paid that formerly went to other States. Well, I don't want him to go too far with this, but I wanted to point out that he's gone a long way already in making sure that you are treated fairly."", ""I want to make another point, too. There have been some great new changes made that pay rich dividends and are going to pay more in the future. In many parts of the country, even including my own capital city in Georgia of Atlanta, we have not been very successful in bringing in professional sports. But there's not a better sports center in the whole Nation than the New Jersey sports complex that is now operating for your enjoyment and pleasure and pride, established by Brendan Byrne."", ""You've already shown, again, that New Jersey can be the State of champions. I just met Jersey Joe Walcott right behind me, who's a great champion and whom I admire."", ""I've observed very closely in recent months the decision that has been made to revitalize Atlantic City. There was a time, when I was a young man, when Atlantic City was looked upon as one of the finest, most beautiful, most progressive, most enjoyable places in the Nation to go. But it began to go downhill. But now, I think, with the new laws that have been passed, Atlantic City can be revived."", ""But there's a danger there, because we don't want to see the prospective recreation facilities, including gambling, being used to support illegal activities or leading to government corruption. And if there's one person in this country that I know can stand firm against the pressures of corruption and guarantee honesty and integrity in the future operations in Atlantic City, it's Brendan Byrne. And I know you agree with me about that, too."", ""Another thing that concerns me very much as President is the very high unemployment rate. In the last 4 years, in New Jersey, the unemployment rate has been reduced 25 percent. We've had more housing programs come into your State than we did in the 8 years gone by. And I just came from a medical center in Newark where, because of the good preventive health care that's now coming to New Jersey, the infant mortality rate has been reduced more than 50 percent, cancer deaths have been reduced more than 50 percent, and tuberculosis deaths have"", 'been reduced more than 60 percent, just in the last 10 years.', 'So, in many ways, including environmental quality, health care, law enforcement, progress for education, pride, recreation, the Brendan Byrne administration has done you a good job.', ""One other point I'd like to make is this: It's very difficult for a politician to come from nowhere and to win an election."", ""This first time I heard about Brendan Byrne, he had never run for office before. He was given very little chance to win. But as you know, 4 years ago, he was elected Governor with your help. Earlier this year, because of the unpopularity of the income tax law, particularly, Brendan Byrne was given practically no chance to win the Democratic primary. Well, he's a fighter. He's slow in bragging about himself, but he believes in you and you have never betrayed his confidence."", ""And something that I cannot say about myself that I can say about Brendan Byrne is that he's never lost an election yet. [Laughter]"", ""The last thing I want to say is this, about this good man: He's a personal friend of mine. I know him. I've visited him in his home. His wife, Jean, and my wife, Rosalynn, are good friends."", ""And I believe that it's important to you as a State that does have economic problems, a State that does have a new lease on life, a State that does now have strict controls over elections, openness in dealing with your own government, a good relationship between administrators and employees in State government, one that's struggling for better transportation, housing, health care, and education, to keep a good administrator in office."", ""As you well know, just a few months ago when New York City across the river couldn't sell its own bonds, there was a great outpouring of surprise when the"", ', 1977 Sept. 12', ""bonds for the sports complex sold so easily at such a low rate of interest. And that's because of sound fiscal management."", 'Compared to the Republican administrations before him, the rate of increase in government spending has been cut in half. And although New Jersey has the highest population density of any State in this Nation, you have the lowest number of State employees per capita of any State in the country.', ""So, I think in almost every way you're getting a good bargain out of Brendan Byrne. And I want to be sure that when the election comes in November, that he gets a good bargain from you and your help and that New Jersey benefits all around with a partnership that's paid off so far and, I believe, is going to pay off even more in the future."", ""Thank you very much. I'm proud to be with you, and I'm proud of you.""]"
1,Jimmy Carter ,"September 10, 1977","['Governor Brendan Byrne, to Senator Pete Williams, to Congressman Pete Rodino, to Mayor Ken Gibson, and to my good friends from New Jersey:', ""I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes this morning about some of the things that are of great importance to you. The first thing I'd like to talk to you about is the New Jersey State income tax. There are people in this State who don't appreciate the great courage and good judgment of Brendan Byrne in putting into effect, along with your legislature, a State income tax which cuts your own property taxes in New Jersey by hundreds of millions of dollars."", 'This tax was designed to give you more than $500 million more for better education. This tax was designed to cut property taxes. And your own mayor told me a few minutes ago that not only have property taxes been cut 7 percent in Newark but they will be kept cut next year as well.', 'This also prevents an increase in sales tax. And as you well know, the income tax is designed to be paid by rich people who can afford it best, rather than the working people and the older people of this country.', ""As a matter of fact, in New Jersey, 84 percent of all the senior citizens in this State pay zero New Jersey income tax. So this tax has given you a fair system which benefits poor people and working families and puts, for a change, some of the tax burden on the rich people that weren't paying taxes in the future--they will pay it in the future. They haven't been paying it in the past."", ""Another thing I'd like to mention is this: You've now got a Governor who looks to the future with great confidence in you and in this State."", ""This afternoon, Mayor Ken Gibson will take 2,000 of your children to see a football game between [Florida] College A&M and Howard University. If it hadn't been for the leadership of the mayor, they wouldn't be going. If it hadn't been for the leadership of the Governor, you would not have had the sport complex for them to play in. So, this is a sign of his looking to the future for your welfare and benefit."", ""As I look around me, in the distance I see new housing programs. In the last 4 years, New Jersey, in the area in which we are now located, Peter Rodino's district, Ken Gibson's city, has had more new housing come here than in all previous history put together. And we are just getting started together to give you a better place to live."", ""I'd like to talk to you for a minute about health care. Just behind us is a center to train medical doctors, nurses, physicians' assistants. In this center right here, under the leadership of Dr. Bergen and your mayor, your Governor, and others, there are more black students studying to be medical doctors than in any other integrated medical college in the United States."", ""And this program has been established and is now in operation without rigid quotas but based on the merit of the students who are studying, behind me, to hold down the disease that's always been so bad, and particularly among poor people."", ""There has not been another place in our country, so far as I know, where there's been such a dramatic reduction in deaths among the poor families and working families of your region. In the last 10 years alone, because of this kind of leadership, infant deaths have been cut 50 percent; deaths because of cancer have been cut 50 percent; deaths because of tuberculosis have been cut 60 percent. And there's no doubt in my mind that under the leadership of Ken Gibson, of Governor Brendan Byrne, of your congressional delegation working with Governor Byrne, that with the output of this great center behind me, new doctors will have an even greater reduction in the future."", ""We are now concentrating, also, on preventive health care. I know that Pete Williams, Pete Rodino, your Governor, and others are going to work to help congressional legislation get passed to cut down on the cost of hospital care. We now have a bill in the Congress to do this. If it doesn't pass, we'll have a doubling in the cost of hospital care every 5 years."", ""So, we must work together to give you better education, fairer tax programs, a good quality place to live, good housing, better health care, prevention of disease, and an opportunity for jobs. The worst single domestic problem that I face--and it's also faced by your Governor and your mayor and the Congress--is unemployment, and particularly in urban areas."", ""A year ago the unemployment rate in your State was 10.3 percent. It's already been reduced by 2 percent. And with the kind of programs that have gone into effect, we have a good chance in the future to reduce it even further."", ""This is a State that now gets its fair share of Federal tax moneys. You've paid them, but in the past you've not been getting them back. When Brendan Byrne came into office, New Jersey ranked 49th among all the States in the Nation in getting your share of Federal money to pay for better housing, health care, law enforcement, transportation. Now New Jersey ranks 34th. And I believe it's fair to say that because of the cooperation that does exist between Governor Byrne and your Members of Congress, even when we had a Republican administration, that New Jersey began to cooperate and get programs that benefit you."", ""You've got a man in the Governor's office of great courage, of sound judgment, and one that's completely honest. And as you see Atlantic City in the future be a revived city, we don't want to see hoodlums come in and take it over. And if there's one man that's strong enough and honest enough to keep out corruption, it's Governor Brendan Byrne."", ""Well, I think all of you know how important it is for a candidate who takes courageous stands for people who don't have much influence to do so in the face of those like some of the demonstrators in this crowd that want special privileges for the ones that haven't paid their taxes in the future."", ""Brendan Byrne is a man who will fight for you if you don't have a job. Brendan Byrne is a man who will fight for you if you're a working-class family. Brendan Byrne is a man who will fight for you if you want better health care, better housing, better education."", ""He's also a man who has fought for you to let the rich pay their fair share of taxes and to let the working people benefit from lower property taxes. And if you want your property taxes to go up in the future, if you want your sales tax to go up in the future, if you want to put a burden on the poor and working-class and retired people, vote against Brendan Byrne."", ""But if you want fair taxes and better services, support Brendan Byrne in the election, which is what I'm doing and what those behind me are doing."", 'Thank you very much. I am proud to be back in New Jersey. God bless you all.']"
2,Jimmy Carter ,"September 24, 1977","['Thank you, everybody. Right on. Thank you very much.', ""It's a great pleasure to me to be back in Virginia with men who will be important in your lives in the future, as they have been in the past--Attorney General Ed Lane, Lieutenant Governor Chuck Robb, Governor Henry Howell."", ""I thought I knew Henry Howell well. I've always heard he was a man of the people. He's the first person I ever saw that came to the White House and ate a cheeseburger with a knife and fork. [Laughter]"", ""I've always been proud of the fact that when I first came to Virginia to begin my campaign a couple of years ago and didn't have very many friends, I went to Henry Howell's home, and he and Betty were nice enough to let me sleep there. I think Henry may have mentioned that on occasion. [Laughter] And I need for you to help me in the next few weeks, because 15 or 20 years from now, I would like very much to be able to tell my grandchildren that I slept in the same bed that was used by the Governor of Virginia. [Laughter]"", ""You have a beautiful State. Of course, I come from a beautiful State, but when I do come to Virginia, I feel an extra degree of humility, because your State has produced eight Presidents and mine has only produced one. [Laughter] It's not an accident that Virginia has produced men and women who have laid the cornerstone of our country, because in historic times and in modern times alike, the characteristics that fill your heart are the ones that have made our Nation great."", ""In 1973 I was Governor of Georgia. I didn't have much time to be away from my own duties. I did not have any responsibilities for the national Democratic Party. But I heard about a man who was running for Governor. I was a small businessman, and I wanted to be sure that I could come to give my own help in a very small way to a man who believes in sound management, balanced budgets, no tax increases. As a farmer, I wanted someone who understood agriculture and the proper interrelationship that must exist between State government and the Federal Government. And I wanted someone as my friend who truly represents the best interests of those who are not rich, not influential, and don't want to dominate government for themselves, but want to see government controlled by consumers and housewives and the working people of this country."", ""So, I took a Saturday off, and I came to Virginia to campaign for Henry Howell in 1973. And then a couple of weeks later, I took another Wednesday afternoon off, and I came to Virginia and got in Henry Howell's bus--he was not with me then; he was campaigning in another place--and I campaigned through the small towns and livestock sale barns and tractor dealerships of Virginia on behalf of Henry Howell. And be lost that Governor's race by less than 1 percent. It was a great disappointment to me, because a lot of those who believed in him so deeply and knew he would do a good job and knew he cared about him didn't get out and work hard enough in the last few days. And the distorted news reports about him, in my opinion, cost him the Governorship. But now is the year to correct that mistake and put him in the office."", ""He's a man who believes in home rule. And if he were to live in Roanoke, people who live in Boones Mill, and those others of you who believe in local government and who believe that a citizen ought to have as many decisions as possible made in the city hall and the county courthouse and not in the State capitol and not in Washington, ought to support Henry Howell, because he is fighting for a home rule provision that'll let every decision possible be made as close as possible to you. That's my kind of government. I believe it's your kind of government."", 'There was one other reason that I wanted to come to Virginia. I had seen some little pins that were even circulating through Georgia with five or six initials on them. And the secret of that slogan was ""Keep the big boys honest.""', ""I believe in the free enterprise system. I'm part of it. And I know there's a very important place for telephone companies and power companies to fill in our lives. But most other States have had a tight control over the step-'by-step increase in charges that are levied against consumers and a very tight control over waste that sometimes exists when there is no regulation of increased prices."", ""And I understand--it's hard to believe, but I understand in Virginia that every time energy costs go up that the utility companies automatically raise your rates, and the regulatory agencies don't have a thing in the world to say about it. That ought to be changed. It's just a matter of fairness. It's just a matter of justice. And I would guess that in the long run, even the utility companies themselves would not be hurt if they knew that any increase in their costs would be carefully examined by public representatives and a reasonable profit allowed. But in your neighboring States they cannot raise rates 15 percent in 1 year without a utility regulatory body saying this is fair to the consumers. That ought to be changed. I understand Henry Howell is the one that can change it."", ""I tried to look at some poll results before I came to Virginia to see what advice I could give Henry Howell. You know how easy it is to give Henry Howell advice. He's so close to the people himself that he doesn't get his counsel and his advice from other politicians. And I'm not going to go in a posture of getting between you and him, because he listens to you, and that's the way it ought to be."", ""But one of the main concerns about Henry Howell is that he's sometimes indiscreet. He brings up subjects that, when examined by the news media, create controversy. But as far as I can see as a politician, that's not anything to be ashamed of; that's something to be proud of. Issues need to be discussed openly and controversial issues ought especially to be discussed openly."", ""The last time that I was in Virginia, before the general election, I was in Williamsburg, where I'll be tonight. Does anybody remember why I came there, to Williamsburg? What was it? That's right, to debate the President of the United States. And I believe that if I had not been willing to enter in those open, frank, free debates with my opponent, that the American people would not have known me and my stand on issues that are important to every one .of you. They would not have had a chance to examine Mr. Ford and his stand on issues that are important to you. And I possibly would not have been elected President. Nobody knows. But I do know one thing: I didn't have anything to hide, and I was willing to debate. My understanding is that Henry Howell is not hiding, and he's willing to debate."", ""Some people may think that it's just a political tactic and kind of a trick when a candidate wants to have open debates. I think it's important. And if there are factors in Henry Howell's philosophy or in his background, in his private life, in his finances, of which he's ashamed, I think they ought to be brought out."", ""So, I believe that it's part of the American system, that began right here in Virginia, to have two candidates, seeking the highest office in your State, meet each other, debate, let you understand how they stand on issues."", ""There's another question that I think is much newer than debates. As you well know, your first President, from Virginia, and others after him believed in debate. But that was a time when it was not ordinarily expected that a public servant or Governor or President would reveal financial holdings. These days, it's different."", ""I believe for the last 11 years, I have disclosed my income tax returns. And I've made a habit every year since I've been a candidate for Governor of Georgia to give a net worth statement to the American people now and to the Georgia people before. I think it's important that this be done, because it lets the people know what is the origin of a person's income, what obligations do they have, what stocks do they hold, what possible conflicts might arise. And even for the most honest man or the most honest woman seeking office, it's a constraint on us to be sure we're not tempted to vote a certain way because we've got stock in a certain company."", ""So, I'm very proud that Henry Howell has been willing to make his net worth a matter of information for you. And he told me on the way here from the airport that Wednesday he's going to reveal his income tax returns. This is good. I hope everybody involved in the Governor's race will do the same."", ""Now, I just want to make one other statement, and then I would like to close. I like to see someone who seeks a major office have courage. I don't know of any issue that's come along in the Southland in my life or in the last 100 years that's been more important nor more controversial than the question of equality, freedom, voting rights, good education for the black people who live among us."", 'In 1959 I was not in politics. I was just a farmer. But Georgia was looking at Virginia, because Virginia politicians--maybe some of you in the audience--had decided, ""We will not integrate our schools. We\'d rather close them down and let our children do without any public education than to take that difficult step."" It was a common thing all over the South. But there was at least one man that I know about in Virginia that ran for the State Legislature, and he said, ""Let\'s take the padlocks off the schoolhouse doors."" Do you know who that was? It was Henry Howell.', ""That's kind of ancient history, I know, but the reason I brought it up was because in the next 4 years there are going to be other decisions that will confront the Governor of Virginia that will provide a serious test of that person's courage. And I hope that in the Statehouse, representing you, is a man who cares about you personally, who is eager to openly debate the issues that are important to you, that has a long record of service, that believes in home rule, that understands business, balanced budgets, no tax increases, that can work closely with local and Federal officials, who casts his lot not with powerful and influential people, but directly with the voters of his State, and a man of courage, and coincidentally, a man who is my personal friend and whom I know well. And that's the man I hope that you'll help elect Governor this year--Henry Howell.""]"
3,Jimmy Carter ,"September 24, 1977","['THE PRESIDENT. Thank you, Henry Howell. Thank you very much, everybody.', ""BYSTANDER. That's northern Virginia over there."", 'THE PRESIDENT. Hi, northern Virginia. [Laughter] Thank you, everybody. Let me get started.', ""After I got the nomination for the highest office in the world, my first day I came to this spot from Warm Springs, and a brief stop in between and then right here. And the friendship that you showed to me here in Henry Howell country, is something that I'll never forget."", ""And of course, I watched with a great deal of interest your recent primary campaign, and I'm very proud of the choices that you did make for attorney general, Lieutenant Governor, and for Governor. You formed a rainbow team that can't be beat, a rainbow team that will not let you down, and I'm here to speak for them."", 'One of my staff members asked me if I knew what a rainbow team meant. I told him that when I ran for Governor of Georgia and was elected, my Lieutenant Governor was Lester Maddox. [Laughter] And I had to say that at the end of the campaign, it was not any way that the Georgia people could tell which end of the rainbow I was on. I ran as an individual and, as has always been the case with Democrats, provided they are close to the people, any sort of definition about conservative, liberal, moderate, liberal-moderate, moderate-liberal, moderate-conservative has very little meaning.', 'When I ran for President, one of the first questions I would always get from the newcomers to\' the news ranks was, ""Are you a liberal or a conservative?"" My answer has always been, ""I vote on each issue as it arises. I make my judgments on the basis of merit. I remember who put me in office. And I try to represent you.""', ""You've got a team on my right that can represent you well. Ed Lane, as a very young man, went to the House of Delegates. He's a man who has the backing and the trust of Virginians of all kinds. His record is a good one--sound conservative management, active in the appropriations committee, understands zero-based budgeting, committed to fairness and equality for all people--a man who is eager to see the office of the attorney general be made more open to serve you. You couldn't find a better platform. And my judgment is that he's strong enough, courageous enough, knowledgeable enough, experienced enough, close enough to you, so when he is elected, he'll carry out his platform. You can't ask for any more, and I believe you can depend on that."", 'Quite different is Chuck Robb, a relative newcomer to politics running for Lieutenant Governor; ran an extraordinary campaign, nobody thought he had a chance; married into a great family; wanting to represent a great State; eager to see the office of Lieutenant Governor become directly responsible for bringing in new industry, new jobs; being a spokesman for Virginia throughout the world; and at the same time, looking at county and city officials and problems with a special eye to how the State government can be more responsive to local needs.', ""And you've already seen welded together Chuck Robb and Henry Howell, so you won't ever have to worry about the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor disagreeing on major issues that affect you. An integral part of the team, and a proven vote-getter, who has great political prospects for the future--even greater, perhaps, than Lieutenant Governor of Virginia--I have great confidence in him, and I'm very proud that Chuck Robb is my friend and I can be here to speak for him."", ""And before I forget, I'd like to say a word about Henry Howell."", ""It's always good in politics to have longtime friends whom you know, whom you understand, in whose house you've visited, whose family you know, whom you observed over several years in trying times--in office and during a campaign, his campaign and my campaign."", 'In 1973 1 was the Governor of Georgia; I had no responsibility to Virginia. But I heard about a man who stands on his own feet. I heard about a man who wanted to ""keep the big boys honest"" and has proven he knows how to do it. I heard about a man who puts his complete faith not in powerful bigshot financiers, bankers, utility company magnates, or even powerful political people, but puts his faith in the average Virginia voter, the working family, the elderly, the struggling, and the proud, who know that our own system of government is best when the people\'s voice is a voice of a Governor. And when Henry Howell is Governor, your voice will be his voice. That\'s why I\'m proud to be his friend and proud that I came in 1973 to help him in his campaign then.', ""Unfortunately, he lost by just a few votes, because the rest of Virginia didn't have as good judgment as the Tidewater area. But I think the rest of Virginia has now learned. But if just a few more people here in his home area had gone to vote, he'd have been elected then."", 'And it would be a serious mistake, when the election comes along this year, for you to take anything for granted. It\'s very important that his home people who know him best and whom he knows best works hard throughout the State with your kinfolks and relatives and friends, to say, ""I know Henry Howell; he\'ll fight for us. Give him your time and your support and your vote.""', ""I came in on a Wednesday afternoon and campaigned for him in '73. I came back later on, because I liked him so well, and campaigned for him on a Saturday afternoon in farmers' markets, tractor dealerships, up and down the street. And I was disappointed that he lost."", ""But I've seen him grow even since then, and I believe he has a much sounder judgement now of your needs and the challenges of the Governorship even than he did have then. It won't hurt that he's got a friend in the White House when he becomes Governor of Virginia."", ""There's no doubt that I'll treat Virginia fair no matter how the campaign comes out. But there won't be any problem in constant communication between Henry Howell and me in the years ahead because he's promised me that if there's ever a need for Virginia people to have the services of a President, that he will not keep me waiting outside the door of the Governor's office in Virginia."", 'There are some basic changes that need to be made in your State. I started my married life here in Norfolk--1009 Buckingham-as a ,young Navy ensign. And the greatness of our military forces, the greatness of your shipyard capabilities, the constant expansion of job opportunities, the closeness between your unique community and our Central Government in Washington are all a very, precious possession that you have. It would be hard to hope to see a major improvement.', ""But I think that if Virginia has one failing, it's that the interests of consumers have not been given adequate attention in the years gone by. Now, I believe that every family has got to have the services of a good telephone system and a good power distribution system. But in your State and mine, too, I don't want to see an uncontrolled monopoly."", 'Henry Howell understands this. And when the price of energy goes up, in most States increases in your power rates have to be approved by a regulatory agency answering to you. But in Virginia the charges are passed on to you automatically. That ought to be changed. And I believe Henry Howell can change it.', ""I understand that one year the rates went up 15 percent--decided only by the power company. I think that if there was a constraint on them that reasonable cost increases could be passed along. But they'd be a lot more careful not to waste money, and they would begin to realize that it's their money they were wasting instead of your money that they were wasting. This is important to you and to all of us."", ""We have the same problem in Washington about powerful companies having too much influence. I put forward to the Congress a comprehensive energy package. Part of it calls for deregulation, over a period of time, of natural gas. And it has, in the proposal, enough incentive to encourage increased exploration and a shifting of natural gas into the interstate pipelines so it comes to States like your own and to Georgia, away from the States where the gas is produced. I'm in favor of that."", 'But the gas companies--very powerful in Washington, as you well know--want to deregulate immediately and add tremendous cost to the American public, not only for new gas to be discovered in the future but for gas that already has been discovered and that will be coming to you in any case.', ""This latest proposal in the Senate would add about $20 billion to the price of natural gas already discovered in Alaska alone and scheduled to be brought down here. I hate to veto a bill that a Democratic Congress passes, but you can depend upon it: I'll protect your interests when the bill comes to my desk."", ""So, I've come here in a spirit of friendship, appreciation to you for your confidence in me as President, to ask you for your help now and in the future on behalf of a longtime personal friend in whom I have complete confidence, and to ask your strong, active, dedicated, sacrificial support in these next few weeks for a Democratic ticket that will serve you well."", ""And it'll make a lot of difference to you who is elected attorney general, who is elected Lieutenant Governor, and who is elected Governor--Ed Lane, Chuck Robb, Henry Howell are a good team. And I believe you and our country will be served well if they are elected. I trust the judgment of Virginia people. And that's why I predict that you and they are going to be very happy when the election night comes."", ""Thank you very much. I'm glad to be with you.""]"
4,Jimmy Carter ,"August 05, 1978","[""Senator Bob Morgan, Senator [Governor] Jim Hunt, one of the finest products that Wilson, North Carolina, has ever produced, future Senator John Ingram, my good friend, distinguished members of the State government, and Members of Congress whom I'll mention a little later:"", ""Let me say that I'm very proud to be the first President of the United States to come to Wilson, North Carolina. If they had known what I've seen today in the form of a welcome, all of them would have been here, just like I've come today."", ""It's good to come to wide-awake Wilson. [Laughter] And I hope that after you've lost your rooster that used to wake people up, that you'll still be able to keep the image that you have now."", 'I had planned today to bring Joe Califano with me. He decided not to come. He discovered that not only is North Carolina the number one tobacco producing State, but that you produce more bricks than anyone in the Nation as well. [Laughter]', ""He did encourage me to come, though. He said it was time for the White House staff to start smoking something regular. [Laughter] I would like to say a word in his defense, because as I am a farmer, as I am deeply interested in the small farmers of this Nation, as I am deeply committed, and permanently, to a fine tobacco loan program, obviously I'm also interested in the health of America."", ""I would say that the tobacco industry, the tobacco farmers, the Federal Government, all .citizens want to have an accurate and an enlightened education program and research program to make the smoking of tobacco even more safe than it is today. And we'll continue these joint programs within which I don't see any incompatibility."", ""I've seen great strides made in our country in recent years in the proper understanding of the farm community. My own people, the Carter family, moved to Georgia from North Carolina. They were farmers. They produced the two greatest crops in my life—peanuts and tobacco."", 'And as I drove in from the airport, I felt at home, because I saw the tobacco fields and the cotton fields, the sweet potato fields, the soybean fields that have made this not only a great producing area but a great marketing area. And I know that in the marketing of flue-cured tobacco, Wilson, North Carolina, has the greatest market in the entire world.', ""My sister moved back to North Carolina and lives not far from here in Fayetteville, North Carolina. And I think you all know, as has already been mentioned before, that I feel an additional kinship for you, because in 1976, when I, as a lonely candidate, came into North Carolina to face formidable opposition, you gave me your hand, you gave me your hearts, you gave me your votes, and you helped put me in the White House. And I won't ever forget it."", ""I'm particularly glad to be in North Carolina because of some of the men on the platform here today, particularly your great Democratic Senator, Bob Morgan. He's a man of courage. He's a man of great intelligence. He's a man whose roots have given him a proper perspective. And although he represents, of course, in his decisions in the Senate, the entire Nation, his heart and his soul and his great allegiance is to the people of this great State."", ""I served as Governor before I became President, and I've seen at first hand the superb, young leadership exemplified by Jim Hunt. He still works closely with me. And as we have recently decided to try to make more effective the joint effort of local officials, State officials, and Federal officials in controlling crime, Jim Hunt has been in the leadership among the 50 Governors who helped to make these programs control crime better."", ""I'm very proud to feel, also, a certain kinship with John Ingram. If there ever was a man who was an underdog and has shown in every statewide race an ability to come from behind and win, he's it, and he's going to do the same thing in 1978."", ""He's a man who's not afraid to fight against political odds. And he's a man who's not afraid to fight against other odds, when he's trying to bring a correction to a system that doesn't treat American citizens fairly. He was the man who rooted out discrimination against women in insurance rates, and he's the man who rooted out discrimination against fine young men in insurance rates. And he's the one, also, who fought against the indiscriminate overcharging of tobacco farmers for insurance. And he's the man who will take the same kind of fight to Washington, to join with me and Bob Morgan to give you an even better life than you have already."", ""I agree with him. I think North Carolina needs a United States Senator who doesn't think that veterans benefits and tobacco loans are the same as welfare."", ""I would like to say a few words to you today about some of the problems that I faced when I became your President. It's not an easy job. It's a very complicated responsibility. It requires good support and understanding among the American people, and it requires a certain human sensitivity to people's needs."", 'I felt when I became President that the farmers of our Nation were approaching a time of repetition of the devastating years of the Hoover Depression. Prices were going down; uncertainty prevailed in farm markets. We needed a new agricultural bill to give farmers some security, some sureness about the future, some stability in their lives, and a right to produce food and fiber and other products that help the American consumer to have low prices and high quality.', ""The agriculture bill of 1977, passed by the Democratic Congress, has brought that improvement already to farmers' lives. It didn't go into effect until last October 1. Nineteen hundred and seventyseven, in spite of the very lowest prices we've had in a long time, saw a world's record in the export of farmers' products overseas—$24 billion in exports in foreign markets."", ""Your number one export product is tobacco. Georgia's number one export product is tobacco. But we also combine that with the export of wheat, soybeans, cotton, and other basic crops, to give the rest of the world good, stable prices and high-quality products and to put our farmers back on the road to prosperity. That was a record year. But I predict today, and I believe my prediction will come true, that we'll see a new record set in 1978 in the export of American farm products overseas."", ""I was concerned, also, about the low family incomes of farmers. And under the new legislation passed last year, implemented for the first time this year, we will see net farm income, income after expenses, increase 25 percent—no less than $5 1/2 billion more in the farmers' pockets, that will go to make everybody have a better life."", 'I would say that one of the most important problems that I have at this time is inflation. This is the kind of secret robbery that hurts every American citizen, every American family.', ""I'm determined to do what I can to control inflation. We have been bringing down the 'budget deficit. I know how North Carolina people feel. You'd rather have services met that the American people require, but you would like to have a balanced budget as well. And that's my goal along with yours."", ""Let me give you some quick statistics. In 1976, when I campaigned in your State for President, the Federal budget deficit was in the sixties of billions of dollars, 1976 fiscal year. In 1978, we cut it down in the fifties of billions of dollars; 1979, in the forties of billions of dollars; 1980, I promise you today that it will be down in the thirties of billions of dollars, and we're headed down to a balanced budget as fast as we can."", 'We\'re also trying to get control of the Federal bureaucracy. When I ran for President, one of the most frequent requests that I had from the American people was, ""Give us a government in Washington of which we can be proud, a government that\'s efficient and effective."" And I believe along with you that American taxpayers deserve a good return on the investment that you put in the Government in Washington, and that\'s what I\'m going to give you.', ""I want to get the Federal Government out of the affairs of private citizens as much as possible. I'm a small businessman myself. I own a cotton gin, a peanut sheller. I sold fertilizing seed to farmers. I know what it means to have unnecessary reports and regulations and redtape. So, we've got some good people in office now, in Washington, who are trying to turn this trend around. It's not easy."", ""Last year, OSHA eliminated 1,100 regulations in 1 day, and I can tell you that this year we're going to eliminate another 1,000 regulations in OSHA. And we're trying to make the Government regulations so they're written in plain English. We're even requiring that the people who write them sign them. And I believe that you will see this good impact in all our communities in the years to come."", ""Let me make one comment to you about the biggest problem that I faced and you faced when I came in office. It's already been mentioned. When I became President, we had just had a report from the Labor Department that 8 percent of all American citizens were out of work. We've changed that. In the last 18 months, we've had a net increase of 6 1/2 million jobs for Americans. We've cut the unemployment rate almost 2 percent. And with the good leadership of Jim Hunt in North Carolina, you've cut the unemployment rate in the last year and a half by 50 percent, better than almost any State I know. So, we believe in putting people in this country back to work."", ""Let me say one additional word—about defense. Our country is now at peace. We haven't had an American soldier fire a gun in combat or anger in the last 18 months. And my prayer is that when I go out of office, we'll still have a nation at peace. That peace can only be ensured with a strong defense."", ""This morning I went to Norfolk-where I first served in the Navy on the old U.S.S. Mississippi—to commission a new United States Ship Mississippi. It's a nuclear carrier. It's designed to exemplify the high commitment that all of us have to giving our Nation a good, strong defense. We have that commitment. And we'll never see our Nation second to any in our ability to fight, if it were necessary, and to prevent fighting by our adherence to peace and a strong military establishment that will always be there, with your support."", ""I would like to say one other thing in closing. There is a time in our country to recognize basic human rights. One of those rights is the ability to speak, even to shout when other people are trying to speak1 [Applause] Let me say to you that that's one basic right that I would never want to see eliminated in our country. Our Nation was founded on the principle of people's liberty, people's freedom, people's individuality, a right to express ourselves, to stand on our own feet, to make our voices heard, to stand for decency and honesty and morality—a nation, through strength, to lead the rest of the world to peace."", '1 The President was referring to a group of people demonstrating near the audience.', ""We've never betrayed those principles. And one of the things that I wanted to do when I came into the President's office, after Vietnam, after Watergate, after the CIA revelations, was to have some standard that I could raise to make Americans once again part of their country. And as long as I'm in the White House, I not only will do everything I can in this country but I'll do everything I can throughout the world to make human rights be two words that the world will never forget. And we'll be the ones to stand more strongly for those rights."", 'America is a religious nation. North Carolina is a State whose families, whose communities are centered around the church. No matter what your own beliefs might be, we know that God teaches us to care for others, to preserve principles in spite of hardship, to exhibit courage when our Nation or our families or our own selves are being tested through difficult times.', 'We are not afraid of the future. We know that our Nation has an inherent strength derived, to a major degree, from belief in God. One of the things that I did when I was campaigning through North Carolina was to say quite openly that I was a believer in God, that I was not ashamed of it, that I was not afraid to say so publicly. As a Baptist, I also believe in the separation of church and state. But those guidelines that often control our lives, which always should control our lives, should also control our Nation.', ""We've a strong nation. But we don't have to be a bully to show it. We want to be the kind of nation that arouses the understanding and the admiration and the friendship of smaller countries, those that are poor, those that are uncertain, those that are new, those whose citizens might be black or .brown or yellow. We're trying- to extend the influence of our Nation and its principles throughout the world in a good, decent way, to make Americans proud."", ""We have a good agenda for the Democratic Party. But there's no way that I can be successful as your President in putting forward those proposals unless I have a team effort."", 'The most important element of that team is obviously the American citizens, yourselves, who share the same principles and hopes that I do. But I also need a good team in the Democratic Party, a party which has always mirrored accurately what North Carolinians want and in which you believe.', 'Bob Morgan, Jim Hunt, in the future, as you know, the fine Senator John Ingram for next year, Congressman Jones, Richardson Pryor, others, your own Congressman Fountain—we have a need to have a strong team. And I hope that this year you remember all the Democratic delegation, measure them with the strictest standards. You will find them not wanting. They need your help.', ""If there's one characteristic of our party which has always been crucial to us, it's closeness to the people. We'll never betray your trust. We recognize that you are the ones who put us in office. We recognize that we have to please you to stay there. And we can only please you if we understand what you want our Nation to be."", ""I have great confidence in the economic strength, the political strength, the military strength of our Nation. It's not getting weaker. Don't believe anyone when they say that our Army or Navy or Air Force or Marines can't handle any challenge that comes to us from any possible adversarial foe. We are the strongest now. We'll always be the strongest militarily. And with your help, with your cooperation, with your support of good candidates, we'll keep a team, a Democratic team that will make our Nation in the future even greater than it has been in the past."", ""We have now and we will always have the greatest nation on Earth: the United States of America. I'm proud to be your President."", 'Thank you very much.']"
5,Jimmy Carter ,"September 22, 1978","['Senator Bob Morgan, Governor Jim Hunt, former Governor Bob Scott, my good friend Congressman Lamar Gudger, Congressman Hefner, and Congressman Mann, Mayor Trantham, Mayor Todd, Chairman White, Chairman McCain, many people in the audience who are responsible for my being President, who share with me the successes and the blame:', ""I'm glad to be back home in North Carolina—even if I am 1 week late. [Laughter] It is partially your credit that we finally ended the Camp David summit with success, because I was eager to come back to North Carolina, and I wasn't the only one who was eager to leave. [Laughter]"", 'The last day, when everything seemed to be going wrong, Prime Minister Begin came up to me and said, ""Mr. President, I promise that Israel will get out of the Sinai, if you\'ll let me get out of Camp David."" [Laughter]', ""It's a good time for all of us in politics and government. In a person's private life, there are times of struggle, times of disappointment, times of challenge, times of failure, times of hope and times of dreams, times of success and notable achievement, times of prayer and times of thanksgiving. And I have felt throughout the last 20 months, and particularly the last 2 or 3 weeks, that your prayers were indeed with me."", ""We have a great country. It's always a mistake for us to overemphasize the transient or rapidly changing problems that we face. Our country has always been willing to face great challenges and to overcome difficulties and to meet difficult challenges and to answer tough questions. We've not changed. We still have the same pioneer spirit that bound us together 200 years ago, or even earlier."", ""My people, the Carter family, moved from North Carolina longer than 200 years ago. And we've always had a kinship with your State and a realization that there was a role for the individual human being in a democratic, free society that could contribute, no matter whether one had a service station or a peanut farm or was occupying the White House. We are party to a team effort and a team spirit that's not going to stop, not going to pause. We're going to continue to make our Nation and to keep our Nation the greatest one on Earth. You can depend on that, if I can depend on you."", ""I'm particularly glad to come here with Lamar Gudger. Although he is new in Congress, he's no newer than I am in the White House— [laughter] —and I have felt particularly close to him. I looked at a clipping from a local newspaper not too long ago, and it said that although I had very good support from the North Carolina congressional delegation, that the best support from any Congressman in Washington from North Carolina was from your friend and my friend, Lamar Gudger. I thank him, and I thank you for sending him there. And I have to make one request of you: When November comes, I want you to send him back with the biggest margin of any Democratic candidate in the whole United States."", 'He has helped me on things that are important to you, along, I have to admit, with other people on this platform—Bob Scott and the other Members of Congress.', ""When I went into the White House, we had a very serious series of problems. As a farmer, as a warehouseman, as someone who's lived in agriculture all my life, I know how bad the farm depression was 20 months ago, 24 months ago. Those of you who are interested in agriculture, think back—prices were going down that the farmers got for our products, prices that they paid for fertilizer, seed, equipment were going up much more rapidly. Net farm income was dropping."", ""Last year, October 1, on my birthday, we put into effect a brand new agriculture bill. And since then, farmers' spirits, farmers' well-being have been going up. This is a great stride forward."", ""Another problem that I had when I became President was the high unemployment rate that Bob Morgan mentioned. When I became President, there were 10 million Americans who could not find a full-time job. More than 7 million Americans did not have a job at all. The unemployment rate had been going up steadily almost for the preceding 8 years. And the Congress and I formed a partnership to try to do something about it. Since that time, we've had a net increase of over 6 million new jobs in the United States."", ""The unemployment rate has dropped 2 full percentage points nationwide, and it's holding steady and progressing in the direction that you want it to move. This could not have been done without cooperation. And one of the best things about our programs that we've put forward is that we've done it not depending just on government handouts and jobs—they've been important for some special groups-but we've tried to strengthen the private enterprise system to let private jobs, permanent jobs be the root of the progress we have made. And that's what we're going to do in the future."", ""I've always been concerned about the Government bureaucracy. I talked about it a lot during the campaign. It's one of the reasons I was elected President. I thought it was bad, but when I got to Washington, it was a lot worse than I thought it was. And we've done something about it."", ""Early last year, the Congress gave me the authority to reorganize the structure of Government, and we've put forward a series of reorganization plans. There's not been a single one refused by the Congress. This is an extraordinary, unprecedented achievement."", 'In the past, Democratic and Republican Presidents have only been successful in having the Congress approve about one out of three of the proposals made. But it shows the harmony that does exist between a Democratic Congress and a Democratic President answering the demands of the American people.', ""For the first time in almost a hundred years, we now have civil service reform on the verge of being passed, thanks to many of you who've let your Members of Congress know how important it is to you."", ""We've got hundreds of thousands of competent, dedicated public servants who work under the civil service system. They want to do a better job. They want to see excellence and dedicated employees re- warded. They don't want to see someone sitting next to them, loafing and incompetent, promoted and paid at the same rate. So, what this new law will do is to let us reward good employees, correct the defects among those that are not very good, inspire them to work harder or fire them if they don't work, and let managers manage the Government, save you money, give you better services. Everybody wins all the way around."", ""I just want to mention one other thing, since I'm in North Carolina and know how you feel. My professional career, as you know, was in the Navy. I was a submarine officer, and I went to the U.S. Naval Academy: I believe in a strong defense. And as long as I and these men are serving you in Washington, we're going to have a strong defense—one so strong that no one will dare to attack us with any thought that they might be successful. You can depend on that."", ""But there's another element of defense, and that is strength through character. We don't need to be a bully, trying to push other people around. We don't need to be combative, with a chip on our shoulder at all times. And since I've been in the White House, we have tried to reach out to others, even some of those who have not been quite so friendly with us in the past."", 'We put our arms around the shoulders of our close friends, who might be living next to one another in a state of war, and we\'ve said, ""Let\'s talk about the problems of our people and bring peace to the world."" Sometimes this has been very unpopular, even with some of you.', ""One of the most difficult decisions that I've ever had to make in politics was to deal with the Panamanian treaty question. Some of you 'didn't like what we did. I realize that. But we now have a new spirit in Latin America, a strong, friendly spirit of mutual respect—not a great nation or a big brother looking down on others, but one in which we've formed a partnership to strengthen those ties of friendship, democratic principles, preservation of human rights. And with that strength, we can keep out the spread of communism in our own hemisphere."", ""We tried to deal fairly with the Turks and the Greeks to bring peace to Cyprus and to restore the damage that had been done to NATO. And lately, we've reached out to our friends, the Egyptians, and our friends, the Israelis, to bring them, for the first time in 30 years, after four wars, to a state of peace and friendship with open borders and trade and an end to the terrible bloodshed that's wreaked havoc in that area."", ""So, there is a combination of strong, staunch military commitment on the one hand, and a nation that's clean and decent and a source of pride on the other hand, where people can respect us and where the true spirit of our country can be shown to the rest of the world. And as long as I'm in the White House, I'll continue to exemplify what you are, what our Nation has been, what our Nation has been in the long past, what our Nation is now, what it can be in the future."", ""I believe in the spirit of commitments that were made 200 years ago, here in your State and mine, and I believe that you want us to raise a banner high of protecting human rights around the world, as we do in our own country, and that's what we're going to have if you'll continue to be partners with us."", ""I don't want to look too far away from you. We've also recognized that the best government is the one closest to you. I don't believe in a big brother in Washington telling you how to run your business. We've tried to get government's nose out of people's business as best we can, but not in a combative or disputive way. We've formed a good alliance with the mayors here on the platform, with the airport manager here where we stand, with Governor Hunt, and many others. And it's very important that we continue this."", ""We're trying to make North Carolina a kind of rural laboratory to show that small towns and cities, like where I live, and people who live on farms have a chance for a better life."", ""Right here where we're standing, even though you've already got some help from the Federal Aviation Administration, I can announce today them will be $2 million more coming in here next month to add 1,500 more feet to your runway, giving you an 8,000-foot runway to connect you with the outside world."", ""And we've tried to do away with some crazy Federal regulations. In 1 day, earlier this year, OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, eliminated 1,100 regulations. We're trying to do the same thing in the Farm Home Administration."", ""I grew up in an area where there's a lot of oak wood and hickory wood that can't be used for much else except burning. And there's been a regulation that even in a farmhouse, you couldn't have a Farm Home Administration loan to put a fireplace in the living room. But we are taking that regulation out to let folks around here that have trees keep warm in the winter and not spend a lot of money on buying fuel that's produced in Oklahoma and Texas."", ""We had another regulation that said when you build a house, you had to provide money for curbs and gutters. Well, where I grew up in the country, we didn't need curbs and gutters. And we are removing that regulation as well."", ""There's another one that says you couldn't get a Farm Home Administration loan if the grade level in the particular area was more than 15 percent. Them are a lot of places around this site we're standing, Asheville, where 15-percent grade looks like flat land. [Laughter] So, we are making changes like this to make your life better."", ""I might say in closing that I need your help. We've had some successes, we've got some challenges ahead. I'm very grateful to you to come out and meet me today. I ask you to help politically as well."", ""I realize there are a lot of Democrats here, I realize there are a lot of Republicans, there are a lot of people who don't have any party affiliation. But I hope you'll give your careful attention to electing John Ingram to the U.S. Senate and Lamar Gudger to the Congress, to give the kind of spirit that I try to exemplify in my own political life—a deep care about people who need help most, who want to stand on their own feet, make their own decisions, arrange their own lives, be proud of their own government, work closely with the local government, respect the officials, respect one another, live in a nation that's strong and peaceful."", ""Those are the kind of things I want; they're the kind of things you want. Together, you and I, we can have them in our country in the future."", 'Thank you very much. God bless every one of you.']"
6,Jimmy Carter ,"October 07, 1978","[""I might say first of all it is not a coincidence that five Presidents have been here to the Mountain State Forest Festival. Not only is this a great part of the Nation and a wonderful and enjoyable thing for us to do, but when Harley Staggers and Jennings Randolph suggest to the President— [laughter] —that he attend the festival in Jennings Randolph's hometown, Harley Staggers' district, it's quite an inappropriate thing to turn them down in the invitation. [Laughter]"", ""I'm also thankful that one of the greatest majority leaders of all time, Bob Byrd, was willing to let me off 3 or 4 hours this afternoon to come.

I'm here to reaffirm that commitment to your future, to the development of the natural resources and the rich human resources of West Virginia. I want the Government that I lead to be the kind of government that will simply let the greatness of the American people be realized."", 'I feel at home here. I grew up near a town about one-tenth as large as Elkins and not too far from a county seat of Americus, Georgia, about exactly the same size as yours, a town where people also depended on the land for a living.', 'We learned how to work, and my people still work, like yours. We had a good life, and we still have a good life, like yours.', ""We take care of each other. We share the pleasures of a country life. We want our children to have opportunities even that we did not enjoy. And we want to be sure that future generations can see a nation that's strong and free, proud, decent, honest."", 'We want our young people to grow up and stay in the community and have sound reasons for doing so. We want jobs for them that are secure, exciting, fulfilling, and that use the talent that God has given each one of us.', ""That's why when I first came to Washington as President, about 20 months ago, I was determined that the Federal Government would take certain stances, would help rural development, help to overcome the problems that we share, and make sure that there's a full partnership between Washington and the rest of the country."", ""It's been a pleasure to work with these men on the stage with me, with Governor Rockefeller and with Jennings Randolph and with Harley Staggers and with Bob Byrd and with others in the West Virginia congressional delegation. We are working to make sure that West Virginia's great potential is realized."", ""It's been a special privilege for me to admire for many years, to know and to grow to understand and to appreciate your senior Senator, Jennings Randolph. I work with him every day. No State has a more strong, vigorous, able, experienced, dedicated spokesman for the things that make our Nation great and strong. Nearly everywhere you look in the United States—in Georgia, in Hawaii, in Alaska, California, New England, and of course, here in West Virginia, you can see something that Jennings Randolph has done for common, ordinary, average, good, working American people."", 'He deserves credit for some of the most far-reaching and exciting ideas that any United States Senator has ever had. More than 20 years ago, he sat down with a roadmap of the United States and drew on that map the lines that presently comprise the Interstate Highway System of our Nation. He had the dream many years before the Congress finally took action. And all of us benefit from it.', ""He is the prime spokesman for the programs that have made the disadvantaged, the unemployed, and the handicapped people of our country enjoy a good life. He's been a strong and stalwart leader and protector of the integrity and the reputation, the respect, and the wellbeing of American veterans."", ""Like my own mother, one of the youngest people on Earth, his youth and his vigor have been used to help those who are just getting started in life, or perhaps have tried to get started and haven't been able. It's not an accident that he was the man, long before the Congress ever took action, long before the Constitution of the United States was ever amended, that thought it was right for 18-year-old American citizens to have a vote. If they were able to fight and die, they ought to have a vote. And it was Jennings Randolph who made this possible for our whole country."", ""He deserves credit for preparing for changing times. He's always had a vision to look to the future, and he's also had the experience and the competence and the respect of his fellow Senators to let his dreams come true for all of us. He's helped us get through Congress steps to evolve a national energy policy, and I wish we had listened to him 20 years ago when he first began to talk of this great need."", ""We have a lot to be thankful for. One of those is that he is a personal, good friend. Mike Mansfield, who was the majority leader of the Senate after Lyndon Johnson, before your own Bob Byrd, said that no human being who has ever served in the Congress of the United States touched more people in a beneficial way than Jennings Randolph. And I don't believe you could pay a higher compliment to a man than that."", ""I'd also like to say a word, if you have no objection, about Harley Staggers. Not many districts can claim a more effective and hard-working Congressman. He's keeping our transportation system strong. And I think that many who know and depend upon a sound railroad system realize that every now and then, you hear about a Staggers amendment for transportation, a Staggers amendment for better health, a Staggers amendment for better energy programs, and he's the author of those great changes that the Congress adopts."", ""He's improved our railroad system more than any other person in the Congress. He's been a key man in the energy program. This year, it's no accident that when the Speaker appointed a committee to evolve our national energy policy—this was last year—that one of the chairmen there—there were three men who did the work—Harley Staggers was in the leadership role. He's made sure that we have a future for synthetic fuels, that we use coal to the best advantage, and that we locate these new and exciting plants where you all know the coal is, in West Virginia. And I think our new energy policy is going to depend on you much more than it has in the past because of him. Well, he's been a great credit to you and a great help to me."", ""I think you can count on me to continue to work with these men and others to see that the Federal Government serves your needs—determined by the people here, not in Washington. Too often in the past, Washington simply wrote checks for projects they decided over there in some obscure bureaucracy that people like you needed. Too often, regulations which were written in Washington prevented the American people from doing a good job and prevented government from being effective. We're trying to do something about those programs."", 'This past week, my White House staff met with Jay Rockefeller, local officials from around your State, to decide what Federal, State, and local people could do together for West Virginia. We let you make the decisions. They looked at dozens of programs. Most of them identified small problems that had been an obstacle—applications sit around too long, regulations are too complicated. And they evolved, before they left Charleston this week, over $200 million worth of projects for housing, economic development, more jobs. Here in your State, these meetings help you to help yourselves. The first Federal grant will be $4.7 million to the State of West Virginia, to be used as a revolving loan to help keep 20,000 threatened jobs.', ""The first use of this fund will be not too far from here, in Morgantown, by keeping safe 800 jobs in that city's largest factory. The second grant will be $14 million, matched by $67 million in local funds and other sources, to help build and to renovate the downtown shopping area and the civic center of Charleston. It complements and adds on to a $5 million EDA grant that I announced the last time I was in your State."", 'This is the kind of initiative that the Federal Government is carrying out to not only let you solve your problems, let you have a better life, but which prevents the deterioration of the downtown urban centers that quite often has been caused in the past.', ""Well, I won't go on and on naming things that we are trying to do, but I would like to say that we are trying to do the best we can with a partnership that's important—not just one man, not just a powerful Senator, not just an influential congressional leader, not just a President, but all of us as a team."", ""We got started less than 2 years ago. We faced 8-percent unemployment, much higher in some parts of your State. We faced serious inflation, which has been with us now for 10 years. We faced an energy crisis with no energy policy. We had record high Federal budget deficits, a $66 billion deficit. When I was running for President in 1976, Government spending, Government bureaucracy were out of control. The people were fed up with waste and mismanagement. But working with Senators Byrd and Randolph, Congressman Staggers, and others, we've been able to do something already about these problems."", ""We've cut unemployment in our whole Nation by one-fourth, down to 6 percent, with over 6 1/2 million net new jobs. We're facing up to inflation now. We look upon it as our number one domestic problem."", ""We want to stop the outrageous increase in hospital costs. We're getting control of runaway government. We've reformed our civil service system. We've cut down already the Federal deficit by $28 billion, from $66 billion the first year, to this coming year, just begun, of $38 billion. It's on the way down."", ""We are cutting back paperwork, eliminating unnecessary regulations, stopping government interference in the private lives of American people. We've tried to keep pace with changing times by keeping our Nation strong militarily, economically, and politically."", ""We've strengthened our Armed Forces. We've kept our alliances with our friends intact. We've got a foreign policy based on peace and on human rights that we can be proud of. We've been working hard not only at Camp David but throughout the world to ensure that we can continue our record, because since I've been in office, thank God, not a single American soldier has shed blood in a foreign land."", ""And finally, let me say that we've done all this because of, not in spite of, the people of this country, by keeping open our system of government, letting you participate, letting you know what's going on."", 'Sometimes you see our mistakes and you see the confusion when a new idea is debated and evolved in government. But by working for a government as good as you are, as kind as you are, as competent as are the people of West Virginia, we hope to reach the heights of which we are capable.', ""We have still a lot to do together. We cannot rest because we've had some successes already. But we can at least be confident that we are facing the future honestly, and we are working for solutions for the good of all."", ""If I can tap the strength and the courage, the ability, the dedication, the patriotism of the people of West Virginia and others like you in our country, we'll have an even greater nation than we have already. And as you well know, we still live in the greatest nation on Earth."", 'Thank you very much.']"

[Laughter]"", ""This is the first time that he and I have ever been together on a campaign trip since the election, and it's no accident. Not only is Minnesota his home, but we consider the elections this year in your State to be unequaled in importance in the entire Nation."", ""I particularly want to thank Gerry Sikorski and your fine mayor for being present to welcome us. I felt surely they'd be in Poland or either in Rome today, one or the other. [Laughter] But I think all of us recognize the tremendous resurgence or surgence of Poles throughout the world; that I predict that next January, when the new Congress is sworn in, that there will be a fine young Polish American Congressman from the First District of Minnesota."", ""I'm very grateful and somewhat sobered to come back to your State. As a Governor for 4 years who served with Wendy Anderson, as a Democrat throughout my life, as someone who has been interested in government earmarked by honesty and decency and openness and responsibility and character and truthfulness and compassion, I think I can say as a Georgian, as an American, as President, that your State and the Democrats in it have long exemplified those attributes above and beyond any other State party in our country. And I want to thank you for it."", ""There are a lot of reasons. One is that there's an ease with which Minnesotans can participate in government. And as I said many times during the campaign, I think government ought to be as good and honest and decent and truthful and compassionate and competent and as filled with love as the people of this country. But you have another reason, as well."", ""The last time I came to your State, it was not a happy occasion. I came here to pay the Nation's last tribute to a man who exemplified more than anyone I have ever known what is good about politics, about government, about public service, and about our country."", ""Hubert Humphrey was a man who was an inspiration to me and, I'm sure, to all of you. He was courageous, he was a fighter. He never backed down in the face of difficulty or a severe challenge or an obstacle. He never was afraid to show emotion. No one ever doubted that his heart was big, because he was genuinely concerned about a person who was black or who could not speak English well or who was poor or who was a Native American or someone who didn't have a job or didn't have a home or had a small farm deeply in debt or didn't have a friend or was struggling to get started in a profession or politics. Everybody knew that there was one man in this Nation to whom they could turn, not just for sympathy, because he was not just a sympathetic type person. But he considered that unfortunate American to be as good as he was, and he wanted to give that person a chance to prove it in a society, in a system that he cherished and loved so much."", 'I remember the difficult days in the South in 1964 when he was running for Vice President. Democrats were fairly scarce in Georgia. Muriel Humphrey came to Georgia to campaign with my mother, Lillian, and my wife, Rosalynn. Bob Short, who will be your next Senator, was there running the nationwide campaign for Hubert Humphrey to be Vice President—a close friend, a loyal friend who came into the South to say, ""We\'ve got a man from Minnesota in whom you can have trust.""', ""This was a fine demonstration of leadership, and of course, our Nation's loss came when Hubert Humphrey was not elected President in 1968 because the Democratic Party was divided. And because the Democratic Party could not heal its wounds after the 1968 convention in Chicago, Hubert Humphrey was not elected President. And Richard Nixon was elected President. That should have taught Democrats a lesson."", ""People are different. Fritz Mondale is different from me. You've got candidates running for Congress, some from the northern part of Minnesota who might be quite conservative on some issues, some from the cities who might be identified as quite liberal. The U.S. Senate candidates are different from one another, but there's a basic underlying commitment of the Democratic Party that does not change. And as President I have stood there in the White House with Fritz Mondale many times and recognized that only because of party loyalty and a common purpose and a common commitment and common ideals and common beliefs, could we prevail. And the Democratic candidates and the Democratic Members of Congress from the South or the West or the North, in a time of trial for our country, domestic or foreign trials, have a tendency to stand together."", ""And I would like to urge you, if I don't do anything else while I'm here, to remember Hubert Humphrey, to remember what happened to him when our party was divided, to remember what he stood for, to remember his friends and commit yourselves now to give the Democratic candidates a tremendous victory on November 7. That's what I want you to do. Will you do it? Will you do it? [Applause] Very good."", 'We still enjoy Hubert Humphrey\'s legacy. The Humphrey-Hawkins bill will give us a chance on the one side to put Americans to work. We\'ve had remarkable success in the last 20 months. The unemployment rate in Minnesota has been cut to less than half what it was. You\'ve got an unbelievably low unemployment rate. But the Humphrey-Hawkins bill is now ready to reach out, to give other people who are hard to employ, the last ones hired, the first ones fired, a decent chance in life. And at the same time it commits us to careful planning for the future, not just to control unemployment but to control inflation, to work together with the Congress, the President, Governors, mayors, employers, workers, farmers, to say, ""What can we do to bring down both unemployment and also inflation at the same time and engender in our country a better use of the tremendous resources, human and natural resources that God gave us?""', ""I want particularly to mention today, Senator Wendell Anderson. He and I were elected Governor together. We served together for 4 years, a bright, young, shining star among the 50 Governors of our Nation. But it's remarkable what he has accomplished since he's been in the Senate."", ""The problems that I face are broad. Energy has been one of the most difficult, challenging, complicated, confusing issues we ever faced. We've never had an energy policy before. Wendy Anderson just happens to serve on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. And he was one of those in the Senate who was able, working with Scoop Jackson and others, to come forth with a proposal that the Congress ultimately accepted."", ""I inherited 20 months ago a budget deficit of $66 billion. I believe Democrats ought to be fiscally responsible. I don't think we ought to waste money. I think we ought to manage the Government well. I think we ought to be efficient, because you've never educated a child, you've never fed a hungry person, you've never built a house or a road with waste and inefficiency. Wendy Anderson just happens to serve on the Senate Budget Committee, and we have already been able, in 2 years, to cut the budget deficit of the United States by more than $28 billion. And it's still on the way down, and I need Wendy Anderson to help me get it down."", ""I'm not going to go down a whole list of things he's done, because that would take too much time. But I would like to say this: I believe that our country has now and always must have the strongest defense capability on Earth. Wendy Anderson just happens to serve on the defense committee in the Senate, the Armed Services Committee. And he, along with me next year, is committed to bringing to our Nation a new SALT agreement hammered out with the Soviets, protecting our interests, to be another major step in eliminating the threat of nuclear war, not only for our own country and the whole world. And I need Wendy Anderson in Washington to help me get that SALT agreement ratified by the Senate."", ""Rudy Perpich has been a good heir to the Governorship of your great State. I think he's brought a new tone to Minnesota politics which is very valuable. He's shown already that he knows how to cut taxes. He's pledged himself to cut taxes even more in a responsible way, not in a ridiculous way."", ""He's a tough Iron Ranger who knows how to fight against waste. He believes in a better education for children. He wants to take care of the health of Minnesotans, not just in Rochester, which has the greatest medical center on Earth, but throughout his State as well. And he's proven that he has the ability to understand just common, ordinary, everyday, good people. He's one of us. He's one of you. And I hope you'll give him your support."", ""And I'd like to mention one other person before I close, who's a fine young candidate, who stayed home today from Rome to be with me. And that's Gerry Sikorski."", ""He was born in a rural community like I was. His family knows what it means to live under a Republican administration, because they lost their farm during the great Hoover Depression. Gerry's father worked on a railroad yard for 40 years. His family knows what it means to be poor, to struggle, to have difficulties and to overcome them."", ""This young man went to college because of his father's hard work. He graduated near the top of his class and, as you know, has been the attorney for a township, which gives him a good insight into the quality of life, not only in rural areas, not only in the life of a poor family, but also, he knows what makes a city great."", 'This district needs a Democratic Congressman. And I hope that you will help me, and I hope that you will help our Nation, and I hope that you will help yourselves by sending Gerry Sikorski to the Congress with a great victory on November 7.', ""I've observed Hubert Humphrey and Muriel Humphrey, Wendy Anderson, your congressional delegation. I can tell you that Minnesota does not send rubberstamps to Congress. You keep the congressional delegation toes to the fire. And whenever there's a conflict in Wendy Anderson's mind between what the President wants and what the people of Minnesota want, he listens to the voices back borne. And that's the way it ought to be."", ""But I'm thankful that in the White House, I've got a man who's a full partner with me, who does the best he can, almost always successfully, to be sure that the President wants what the Minnesota people want—and that's Fritz Mondale."", ""I think I can say without anyone disputing this that there has never been in the history of the United States a closer and more valuable partnership between the President of our country and the Vice President of our country, than between Jimmy Carter and Fritz Mondale. And I'm thankful for that."", ""There are no decisions which I make in which he is not involved. He is my foremost adviser, my closest confidant. He's the man to whom I turn when I have a problem or have trouble or a difficulty that I can't resolve. He knows this country well. He knows the Members of Congress. His ideals, his standards, his integrity is absolutely impeccable, and you know that. But I would like to thank you for training a man and giving to me a man to serve as Vice President with the qualities that Fritz Mondale has brought to my administration. Thank you very much."", 'Of course he helps me in domestic affairs, presiding over the Senate. But when I got in trouble at Camp David a few weeks ago, and it became obvious to me that the situation was hopeless and that both the Egyptians and the Israelis were ready to leave and go home, I put in a call to Fritz Mondale.', 'I said, ""Fritz, what are your plans for the day?"" And he said, ""I have three States to visit. My promises have already been made."" And I said, ""I would like for you to cancel that trip and come to Camp David,"" which he did. And it doubled the ability that I had to deal effectively with Prime Minister Begin and President Sadat, because I never had any doubt that when Fritz Mondale was talking to President Sadat or to Prime Minister Begin or their delegations, that he spoke with the same authority and the same voice as though I was there myself.', 'But the most important thing was that there was no doubt in the minds of Sadat and Begin that when Fritz Mondale spoke, he was speaking for the President of the United States. And we are indeed fortunate in this country to have a man like him as Vice President. I sincerely hope that you will not tell him what I said about him. [Laughter]', ""Let me close by saying this: It's no accident, as I said earlier, that Fritz and I have come together here. This is the most important State in the Nation for elections this year. You've come here to see a President. You've come here because you're interested in government. But your coming here is not enough."", 'I would like for every one of you when you leave here to resolve in your own heart to make a contribution to your country by sending to Washington two Democratic United States Senators, eight Democratic Members of Congress, and keeping in office a fine Democratic Governor and his administration.', ""You believe that all of us when we get in office should do a good job. But the responsibility is also on your shoulder. And I have seen many fine candidates lose an election—that close—because their best friends, allies, neighbors, relatives, supporters took an election for granted or were not willing to invest a tiny bit of one's own character and ability and finances in a successful campaign."", ""There is no one here that can't go home, no matter how old or young you might be, and become a campaign manager for the candidates that you admire so much. Organize your own home, your own block, your own community, and let's make November 7 be a tremendous victory for the Democratic Party and for our Nation."", ""We've got the greatest nation on Earth. If you work hard enough between now and November, then in the future it can be even greater than it already is."", ""Thank you very much. You do your part; I'll do mine.""]"

[Laughter] My brother Billy has not been in the news all week. [Laughter] He has the only gas station listed in Fortune 500.

We get to see more of her now than we used to. She had John Travolta come and eat supper with us for one of her birthday presents."", 'She wanted to see both his movies and we wouldn\'t let her go because she\'s not old enough. Amy said, ""Well, Daddy, I\'d like to remind you that I\'m a preteenager."" And I said, ""Amy, you\'ve been a preteenager for a long time, ever since you were born."" And she said, ""Yes, but now I\'m a double-digit preteenager."" [Laughter] We don\'t let people use ""double-digit"" around the White House any more until we get inflation under control. That\'s what we\'re going to do next. [Laughter]', ""I've come here tonight to speak to you briefly about our country from the perspective of the President. When I think back on my own relatively brief political career, I think in a strange way my life has been centered around Minnesota."", 'Those of us who believe in our Nation, who believe in the highest principles of public service, who believe in politics in a decent and clean fashion, who have never been afraid to address difficult questions, look upon Minnesota as an example for the other states. And we look upon the dean, the founder of the DFL, Hubert Humphrey, as an idol throughout the country.', ""I've been to Minnesota twice before this since I've been President. The first time I stopped in Minneapolis and asked Senator Humphrey to ride with me on Air Force One when he returned back to Washington after a long, sustained treatment for his terminal illness."", ""On the way back to Washington, I asked him if he would visit Camp David with me. He said he had never been there. And so the following month, Senator Humphrey and I and his doctor spent the entire weekend alone at Camp David. I've never learned more in a briefer period of time in all my life about people, about Minnesota, about farmers, about older citizens, about poor people, about those who are black or brown or yellow, who can't speak English well."", ""I've never learned more about the proper interrelationship between our own country and others. He talked to me about some of the needs of repairing damage that had been done to our country by the Vietnam war, by the CIA revelations, by Watergate; how he traveled in many nations when he was Vice President."", 'We discussed together the dread that he felt as a major leader, that I felt as a Governor, a candidate for President, as President, every fall when the United Nations General Assembly convened, to know that the Nation that we loved would be the butt of every joke and the target of every attack by the small and the weak and the new nations of the world; and how we needed to repair the damage that had been done to our basic government structure.', 'He talked to me about his love for Israel, his long relationship with those in this country who support and strengthen and sustain that fine young democracy which has been plagued by war four times in 30 years. He knew President Sadat. He knew Prime Minister Begin. He knew the other leaders of Israel. He taught me about them, and we compared notes about what we knew.', ""And this entire weekend served to strengthen my commitments to make our Nation's Government more nearly meet the standards that Hubert Humphrey set in his own life, that he helped to establish in the DFL in Minnesota, that he helped to bring to Washington in a clean and a pure and a decent fashion."", ""And our Nation's better, as you well know, because he lived and because he served you and because he served me."", ""I believe that a government should be competent. I think it ought to be well organized. I think the Government should put its budget together in a careful way so that the taxpayers' money should not be wasted and so that there should be the utmost service rendered to those who need it for a given level of Government expenditures."", ""My own background is as a working person, a farmer; my training is as an engineer and a scientist. And I've tried to bring to the Government those principles, because you can't educate a child, you can't feed a hungry person, you can't build a home with waste and mismanagement and fraud. And for too long the people in our country have had a growing doubt about the ability of government to handle its own affairs."", ""And I think with the help of those on the stage with me tonight, particularly Fritz Mondale, we've made progress in that respect. I won't repeat what he's already said so well. But we've done a few additional things."", ""One was to recognize the quality of the civil servants of our country, people who believed in government, entered it at a very low wage, knew that they had one life to live on Earth, one career to contribute. They didn't ever get any glory or fame. They didn't ever hear a crowd applaud. They quite often were not recognized for what they achieved. They were often castigated or criticized when someone else made a mistake."", ""And now, after 95 years, we have reformed the civil service system to reward and encourage those who are competent and who do a good job, who contribute well; to identify those who don't do so well, who are not competent, who are not well motivated, perhaps lazy, so that they can be encouraged to do better, or transferred or discharged."", ""And we now have a civil service coming on that will let managers manage and make us proud once again of our Government. This is the kind of thing we've tried to bring to make government more competent."", 'I believe in the free enterprise system, and I particularly believe in the free, competitive part of it.', ""In the past, in our Government—too often in the past we've established regulatory commissions or passed laws ostensibly to protect consumers. But over a period of years of abuse and political pressure and intrigue, and intense focusing by special interest groups on those regulatory agencies, their purpose has been subverted. And instead of protecting the consumers against the regulated industry, they've turned and protected the regulated industry against consumers. We're trying to change that and I believe we can change it."", ""One quick example is the airline industry. We've got in the last few months a tremendous reduction in air fares, Formerly empty planes are now full. Traffic has gone up tremendously. Profits have gone up tremendously. And I'll predict that within the next few years the Civil Aeronautics Board will find that its existence is no longer needed. Consumers will benefit. Airlines will benefit. Our Nation will benefit as well."", 'So, competence in managing the Government is very good indeed.', ""Another thing that we need, of course, is a government that's compassionate, that understands the needs of others. And I think here is where Fritz Mondale has contributed to my own administration in a way that's brought credit to you and to those that I've mentioned already, particularly Senators Humphrey."", ""We also have a need to have a strong defense, a strong nation politically, a strong nation economically. We're not trying to use this strength to benefit ourselves at the expense of others. We are strong enough now not to have to depend on every cheap, tinhorn dictatorship in the world. We're supporting human rights. And as long as I'm in the White House, we'll continue to do so."", 'I don\'t believe there is a national leader on Earth who can now spend a full day without asking himself or herself, ""How does my own administration, how does my own nation measure up in the opinion of our citizens or those around the world in protecting basic human rights?"" And this applies not only in the totalitarian governments that will stay that way for many years in the future, but it applies to those countries, many, several at least in Latin America, that are now changing from a totalitarian dictatorship into a free and open democratic system.', ""This is a good trend. And I believe that we've now raised the banner whereby we can once again be proud that our Nation's Government stands for the same principles that the citizens have always espoused and which were the foundation for our Government and our Nation 200 years ago."", ""The last point I'd like to make is this: We have become, as Fritz Mondale said, a nation committed not only to peace for our own people, but a nation committed to peace for others. I thank God that since I've been President, not a single American soldier has shed blood in a foreign country. And I hope I leave office with that record."", ""We've become involved, at considerable political risk, in trying to negotiate peace in other parts of the world. Secretary Vance earlier this week was in South Africa, meeting there with leaders of four other Western nations—France, England, West Germany, Canada—to try to induce the South African Government to support peace, democracy, majority rule, one-person-one-vote principles in the nation of Namibia and also the nation of Rhodesia."", ""He left there to go to the Soviet Union, and he's now negotiating with Foreign Minister Gromyko and President Brezhnev, trying to bring back to me response to proposals that would secure an effective and adequate SALT agreement to remove the threat of nuclear weapons that endangers the lives of all those on Earth. And I need Wendy Anderson and I need the whole Democratic group to help me next year get it ratified."", 'Warren Christopher, the Deputy Secretary of State, is in Greece. We are trying to secure peace on the island of Cyprus and to eliminate the animosity that existed for several years between Greece and Turkey, our allies.', ""I've personally become involved, as you know, in trying to negotiate a peace in the Holy Land between Israel and Egypt. We had good success at Camp David. But we only formed a framework or an outline for peace. Many differences still exist."", ""I have found the last 2 weeks that it's much more difficult to negotiate the details of a peace treaty than it was a general outline of a peace treaty, And it's exceptionally difficult when the Prime Minister and President each are thousands of miles away, rather than just a few yards away from me and away from each other. But we are being persistent in this effort."", 'The Israeli delegation has now left to go back to Israel for a report to the Cabinet the first of next week, consultations with Prime Minister Begin, and to receive new instructions from their own country.', 'I met yesterday afternoon with Foreign Minister Dayan and Defense Minister Weizman. Last night, late, I met for 3 1/2 hours with the Israeli delegation to try to go into details of the differences that still remain between themselves and the Egyptians. This morning at 6:45 I was meeting with the Egyptian delegation-making good progress each time we met. But the outcome is not assured, and we still need the hopes and the prayers of the people of this country to realize a final peace treaty between Egypt and Israel in the next few weeks.', ""And I ask you to remember that in the past, the successes that we have achieved in all these areas of a troubled world have only been possible because I don't speak with an isolated, hollow voice. We have not tried to evolve foreign policy in a secret, closed closet."", ""We have put forward the principles of negotiation and a frank description of the problems so that you could become involved in assessing those problems and helping me to find solutions. Sometimes this has not been a popular nor an easy process. But there is no doubt that when Fritz Mondale or I meet with a foreign leader—Begin, Sadat, or others—they know that we don't speak idly, that we speak because the Congress gives us its backing and because the people of the United States, more than 200 million of you, are involved in the process as full partners."", 'So, I believe that our Government now has become more competent. It has not lost its attitude of compassion and concern. And we have become the epitome for many in our search for peace through strength.', ""My closing message to you tonight is this: You've made a great investment in the DFL. You've made a great investment in having an exemplary State government. You've made a great investment in sending distinguished leaders to Washington. And I urge you during the next 3 weeks to commit yourselves to an extra commitment, an extra effort, even sacrificial in nature, to overcome differences among you and to have the full Democratic slate elected in November, to give me strength to make our Nation even stronger."", 'Thank you very much.']"
9,Jimmy Carter ,"October 21, 1978","[""Senator Bill Roy—doesn't that sound good? Well, it sounds good for the whole country; Governor John Carlin—that also sounds great—Congressman Dan Glickman; Congresswoman Martha Keys; distinguished officials of the Democratic Party in Kansas, which is constantly growing day by day, larger and larger, stronger and stronger; my fellow Americans who realize that we have a great country and we want to see it even greater:"", ""It's an honor for me to come back to Kansas."", ""When I was first elected Governor of Georgia, there was a man whom I met in just a few days after the election, a man who was an inspiration to me and to all the other Governors who served with him, who was kind of a guide for us, and who set an example of sound management and integrity, competence, and that was Bob Docking1 And I think it's good that Kansans remember the sound statesmanship that has been exemplified in him and in your congressional delegation by Democrats."", '1 Former Governor of Kansas.', ""I've enjoyed replacing Republicans in the White House. [Laughter] We've been trying to turn the country around, trying to manage the Government better, trying to cut redtape. When I got there the Republicans were cutting redtape, but they were cutting it lengthwise. [Laughter]"", ""We've had a good experience in the last 20 months. But I look forward to seeing the Congress reconvene next January with Bill Roy as the first Democratic Senator to come from Kansas in, I believe, 46 years."", ""As you well know, he's a man of unique character and ability and background and experience. I think out of more than 200 million Americans, there .are only 350 people who have both a degree in medicine and one in law. And he's had an ability as a Member of Congress, in the House of Representatives, to assess long before some of us realized it the intense need to give better services to people, particularly in the rural and small areas, emergency medical care, and at the same time cut the cost of this kind of care that all of us need. He set up health maintenance organizations, which gave us a mechanism by which people could cooperate in preventive health care, and at the same time set up mechanisms also to spread health care in an emergency way throughout our regional areas where doctors and medical care had been scarce."", ""He's a man who knows how to manage money, a sound and an effective legislator, and I look forward to being with him next year. He's a man also who has Kansas blood in his veins. He's quite independent, and I don't have any doubt that when his judgment comes down to what does the President want on the one hand and what do the people of Kansas want on the other, that he's going to vote with Kansas, and I'll forgive him for that ahead of time."", 'And I look forward to my next trip back to Wichita, back to Kansas when you will have a Democratic Governor.', ""John Carlin is the kind of candidate who in a leadership position in the Democratic Party makes a Democratic President proud. He's young. He's effective. As a speaker of your house, he's shown his wide grasp of the factors that make Kansans' lives better—good fiscal management, a sound and a fair tax structure."", ""And one of the things I particularly like about John Carlin, as a peanut farmer, is that he's a farmer himself. [Laughter] I'm not saying that he and I are going to plot against the other Americans, but we want to make sure that the farm families of this country don't suffer."", ""I've read a great deal about John Carlin before I came to Kansas. The only criticism that I've seen mentioned in the national press, that we read in Washington, is that some people have accused him of being too fiscally responsible. [Laughter] And I think that's a very fine criticism to make of a man who will serve as a Governor of a State like Kansas."", ""I don't want to see anybody in office who wants to waste money that the taxpayers send up. I think an efficient, effective government is the best one to deliver proper services to people, particularly when the philosophy of Kansan people needs to be adequately represented in the Governor's office. And I know John Carlin will do that."", ""Dan Glickman is a freshman Congressman, but he acts like one who's been there 20 years. [Laughter] My staff analyzed his record in the 95th Congress. There were nine major amendments that the Congress passed with Dan Glickman's name on them. And that is almost unprecedented. It shows that he has an intense commitment to hard work and effective work for you in Washington. And his service on the Agriculture Committee and, as you know, on the Science and Technology Committee fits in perfectly with Kansans' lives and particularly the region around Wichita, because you have equal to all other communities in the Nation a commitment to the future, in space, aviation, technology, as well as being the foremost wheat-producing State and one of the largest and best agricultural production States in the Nation."", ""And Dan Clickman fits in so well in his committee assignments—I think that's what has made him so strong, because he represents what you want with such an effective voice."", ""And I can't pass by an opportunity, although this is not her district, to mention Martha Keys, a woman with great influence, intellect, intelligence, courage, and who, even though this is only her second term, has become a foremost leader on perhaps the most important committee in the Congress, the House Ways and Means Committee."", ""She's responsible for health care, welfare, taxation, energy; and the legislation that the Congress has passed this year has her mark on it. And when she puts a mark on legislation, you can rest assured that the people of Kansas come out very well with her influence. I'm very proud of her."", ""I'd like to mention just a few things briefly that are on my mind this morning as I talk to you as President of your country."", ""All of us, I believe, in this audience realize that agriculture provides the industry that's the basic strength of our Nation. In the last 21 months or so, I've had an opportunity as a new President to analyze the strategic balance that exists between our country on the one hand and the others nations of the Earth on the other."", ""We believe, in fact we know that we have a superior position in politics, in government, economics, military might. But there are a lot of nations who compete with us in those varying aspects of international life. The one sound, stable, unchanging advantage that we have over all others is the land that God gave us, over which we act as stewards. Our productivity in agriculture is increasingly important now. But in the future, it gives us an assurance of a good life, an assurance of a beneficial impact and influence in other nations that's one of the proudest possessions of myself as President, of other members of our government, and indeed of the Western free world."", 'We cannot only correct many of our economic problems with our tremendous agricultural production, but we can use this influence to benefit the lives of many others. I think all of you know that in January of 1977, when I became President, the farm families of this country were in trouble. The people in Georgia, where I live, many of the people in Kansas, as well, were discouraged.', 'There were some predictions that agriculture in America was facing another depression, where the low relative income of American farm families was going to be even lower. Prices had hit the bottom; exports were faltering; the Government was becoming more deeply intrusive in the lives of farm families, in the marketing of wheat, corn, basic feed grains, sorghums. The farm families quite often sold their crops cheap that went into the massive grain elevators. Commodity prices were manipulated. Sometimes prices went up, and the beneficiaries were not the farmers, because they had lost control over the food that they had produced.', ""That's been changed. The new farm legislation supported by your own Members of Congress, of course, went into effect almost exactly a year ago. Farm family income has gone up in 1 year $7 billion, between 20 and 25 percent more. We've tried to get government out of the lives of farmers. We've increased farm storage tremendously to let the farmers themselves have much more control over when they market their products, so that they can get the benefits of the changes in farm prices. And at the same time, we've tried to stabilize those prices."", ""We see American farm production continuing to go up. This year in the United States, the average corn production per acre is 100 bushels. At the same time, we don't feel that we need to worry about this good production, because we're working as hard as possible to increase the markets for American farm products."", ""Last year, we set an all-time record, even in dollars, with very low prices, as you well remember. We exported $24 billion worth of farm products in 1977. In 1978 we'll beat that record. We'll go to $26.6 billion in farm exports."", ""In just a few minutes, not coincidentally in Wichita, I'm going to sign a new agricultural export bill that will greatly enhance American farm export levels in the years to come."", ""These kinds of changes that have been made in the Government help us all. They're typical of the approach to American farm life of the Democratic Party. But this is just one example out of many that I could mention."", ""The Democratic Party has always been a party of two things: one, compassion. We've always been concerned about people who need help. We've never believed in handouts, but we do believe in extending a hand to help someone, to help people stand on their own feet, support themselves, make their own decisions, become an integral part of a dynamic society."", 'We believe in children having a good education; young couples having an opportunity to buy a home; good highways to carry our products to market, to let us visit one another.', 'We believe in a strong defense. We also believe that we have to let people be employed. One of the greatest hungers in the life of a person is to let that one life, given by God, be used in a beneficial way.', ""I can't think of anything more devastating to a young man or woman, 18, 19, 20 years old, as they approach adulthood and begin to take their place in the community, than not to have a job and day by day by day be identified in one's own mind, in one's own family, in one's own community, as a failure, a nonproductive member of a great American society."", ""When I became President, we had 10 million Americans who did not have a full-time job, 7 million or more who had no job and who were looking for jobs. The Democratic Congress worked well with me. And we set up programs primarily to open up job opportunities in the private sector, because five out of six of the jobs in our country don't relate to government at all."", ""We've cut the unemployment rate 25 percent in just a short time that we've been in office. We've had a net increase of more than 6 million jobs in our country. This is the kind of approach that I think is proper for the Democratic Party to have."", ""We recognized some longstanding defects. We did not have, as you may have heard, a comprehensive national energy policy. And you know I said that it was the moral equivalent of war. I was beginning to feel it was the moral equivalent of the Hundred Years War. [Laughter] But the Congress has now passed a good energy bill. And it'll be improved by administrative action, and it'll probably be improved in the future by changes that Congress might make."", ""We've got a new Department of Energy now, and I think we can guarantee to you here not only a good market for energy products produced in your State but an assured supply of reasonably priced products in the years to come. We'll start conserving more. We'll start shifting to the more plentiful supplies of energy, and we'll have a chance to cut down on the enormous imports that have bled from our Nation, about $45 billion per year. We now import about 50 percent of our total oil. We want to turn that around."", ""We've also tried to root out fraud, mismanagement, waste from the Government."", ""I was concerned when I became President, when I was running for President, about the enormous budget deficits. It rubbed me wrong, as someone who's worked all my life for my own living, to see the budget deficits in Washington continue to go up and up and up."", ""When I was a candidate back in 1976, the budget deficit was almost $70 billion. We have already cut that budget deficit down to just a little above $40 billion, and we're moving in the right direction. And I'll keep as one of the major goals of my own administration a balanced budget. That's what I want to see while I'm still in the White House."", ""I think some of the most sacrificial and dedicated workers that I know of in the country are those who work for the Government. I'm not just talking about in the White House but other places as well. They are people who have offered their whole life's career to serving others."", ""But we had kind of a disgrace in the civil service system. And now the Congress has reformed the civil service for the first time in 95 years, and we are letting good, dedicated, competent, hard-working employees in the future be recognized and rewarded—and those who don't work quite so hard, we're going to inspire them to do a little bit better. If they don't, they're going to be transferred. If they don't improve, they'll be discharged."", ""And now managers can manage. But we're trying to put into our Government itself the same sort of fiscal management that has epitomized the successful elements of a free enterprise system."", ""I might say in passing that we're trying to make the free enterprise system better, a little bit more free. I think if you all would think back in the last few years, any of you who have flown in a commercial airline, you know that the rates have dropped tremendously. And you know why that's happened? Because we have gotten a Government regulatory agency to let the airlines compete with each other. In other words, we have gotten Government's nose out of the people's business and the rates have gone down; those empty airplanes have started filling up. It doesn't cost as much to haul one passenger, and the airlines are making more profit. And this is a very excellent example of what we are trying to do in Washington."", 'Well, I could go on and on. But I do want to mention two more things before I close. One is in foreign affairs.', ""I think all of us realize that 2 years ago, 3 years ago, the American people were disheartened, we were embarrassed, we were alienated from our Government. Sometimes we Americans were even ashamed of our own Government. The Vietnam war, the CIA revelations, the Watergate scandals, all made us feel that our country was not quite so clean, not quite so decent, not quite so honest, not quite so open as it ought to be. But we've turned that around as best we could. No one's perfect."", ""We've not only tried to bring that kind of attitude to government, we've also raised high a banner for the world to see of the principles and ideals on which American life has been founded for the last 200 years. And there's not a single leader in the world among 150 nations who doesn't think every day now about basic human rights. And as long as I'm in the White House, they're going to keep on thinking about that."", ""And the last thing I want to mention is this: We are a strong people. We're a people who have never been afraid of a challenge. We don't like to be pushed around. We have the strongest military strength in the world. We're going to keep it that way."", ""But we also believe in peace. And I thank God that since I've been in the White House, we've not had a single American soldier shed blood in a foreign country. And I hope I can go out of office having maintained that record of peace built on strength, not just for ourselves, but we are trying every day, through the most intense, concerted effort, to bring peace to others around the world who have been suffering more than we have."", ""Cy Vance just left South Africa a few days ago, 2 days go, where he's trying to make sure that Namibia doesn't erupt into war, trying to bring peace to Rhodesia. He's negotiating today in Moscow to have concluded a good SALT agreement that'll protect us in the future."", ""We had good luck at Camp David in trying to bring— [applause] —and I think one of the reasons that we had this success so far is because of the commitment of American people to extend a hand of moderation and conciliation and help to others like President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin who genuinely want peace for their people. But that's escaped the Holy Land, as you know, for hundreds and hundreds of years. And I hope we will be successful in our negotiations."", ""So, I've tried to outline as briefly as I could some of the characteristics, some of the achievements, some of the remaining problems of the Democratic Party."", ""We don't claim that we know all the answers. But we have an innate strength as Democrats, in that we cast our lot directly with you. We derive our strength from you, our counsel and advice from you, our criticisms, in a constructive way, from you."", ""We try to stay close to you, because I said during the campaign many times-sometimes the press teased me about it-that I want a government in Washington as good and decent and honest and truthful and competent as the American people. That's what we want to have. And I believe that we'll have it."", ""One of the best ways to guarantee it is to give me in Washington, from Kansas, a good Democratic team to work with. That's important."", ""You've come here today to help the candidates in whom you believe, for U.S. Senate, for Governor, for Congress. And I hope every one of you will go away from this meeting, not with a sense that you've done enough by coming here, but with a determination to make your own lives a kind of a focal point for success for the candidates in whom you believe. Each one of you has the character and ability and influence to be kind of a one-person campaign manager for Bill Roy, John Carlin, for your candidates for Congress."", ""And I want you to pledge to me as Americans that you'll not only vote but that you will work between now and November 7. And with these candidates being successful, with your help, we'll make the greatest nation on Earth even greater in years to come."", 'Thank you very much.']"

He was a man who was independent. He was a man who loved his home State. He was a man who founded the principles of our party, that said that those who hold public office have to put our faith, our confidence, our responsibility to the average, common, good American citizens who put us in office.', ""That was Andrew Jackson's commitment. That's the commitment of the Democratic Party today, and we're going to keep it that way."", ""There has been a time in the last few years when Tennessee strayed temporarily from the Democratic Party and from the principles of Andrew Jackson. But that time is gone. And in the last few years, we've seen a major shift back toward Democrats by Tennessee, and that's going to keep on the next 2 weeks."", ""Georgia, my own State, has always been close to Tennessee. We share a lot with you. When it snows in the north Georgia mountains and the northwestern part of our State, our State legislators have to come through Tennessee to get home to Atlanta to act as legislators. We've always kept those borders open, except one time when General Sherman crossed them on the way from Tennessee through Atlanta. But with that one exception, we bind ourselves to you."", ""We'll keep those lines open. And I'm proud to say that as Tennesseans, I consider you my brother, and I'm glad to be here as that, too."", 'In addition to Andrew Jackson, Tennessee has provided some great Democratic statesmen: James K.

He won 11 of them. He wasn't elected President, but he set a standard of campaigning that I followed very closely when in 1976 I entered 30 primaries and won a fairly good number of those— [laughter] which gave me an avenue to the White House."", ""I want to recognize, too, a great United States Senator who served at the same time, Senator Albert Gore, who's been an inspiration to a lot of southerners."", 'As you well know, when the South was going through those difficult days of changing from a segregated society to one where we gave all American citizens equal rights, regardless of color, Albert Gore, Estes Kefauver set a standard for the rest of us to follow.

And I want to thank them for what they meant to me and to my own people.', ""I'll always remember the Democratic convention when Frank Clement made an inspiring address, and his son, Bob,2 has brought the same kind of approach to Democratic politics in this State.

The night before last, my wife and I were on the telephone talking to June Carter and also to her husband, as you know, about the unfortunate loss of Maybelle Carter. She set not only a standard in country music that's inspired Johnny Cash and many others as well as her own family, but she also set a standard of common, ordinary people who love one another, expressing their views, their hopes, their dreams, their fears to the world through music.

And I want to ask your promise as the last thing today, will you help me with our anti-inflation program to control inflation in this country? Will you help me? [Applause] Right on.', ""Well, I want to close by saying this: You've shown your confidence in me as a Georgian, as a neighbor, as a southerner, as an American. The Presidency of the United States is not an easy job. But I feel at ease with it, in spite of the difficulties, in spite of the challenges, in spite of the promises that need to be kept, in spite of the problems that face me every day, because I cast my lot with you when I ran for President. I also stood on street corners, in factory shift lines, went through city halls and courthouses, met you on the street, shook hands, asked for your advice and your support."", ""That's where my strength comes from, from you. That's where the strength of Andrew Jackson came from, from you. And I hope to maintain your confidence in me and improve your confidence in the Federal Government by good management, by peace, by openness, by strength, and because you control me and your Government."", 'This is what the Democratic Party stands for also. And I hope on November 7 that all of you will do the best you can to elect the fine slate of Democratic officers and make the greatest nation on Earth even greater in the future.

Will you help them in 12 days to be elected? [Applause]"", 'Florida needs a Governor who will continue the absolutely superb work of my friend, Governor Reubin Askew, one of the greatest Governors who ever served any State in this country.', 'Florida needs a Governor who knows what it means to work, a man who has held, during the campaign, more than a hundred jobs, spending a day alongside Floridians like you on farms, in factories, grocery stores, working in hotels, learning what it means to take care of a home, trying to see at first hand what could be done to make Florida an even greater State.', ""Florida needs a man who can come from a position as an underdog and be triumphant over nine other very worthy, dedicated, competent candidates who challenged him. Florida needs a man who knows about education, who served as the chairman of the Senate Education Committee, who's worked as a teacher, who knows what it means to give our young people, indeed our old people as well, a chance to continue to stretch minds, to stretch hearts throughout their life's existence."", ""Florida needs a Governor who understands your basic natural resources, your basic human resources. He wants to see those resources developed in the most effective way. Florida needs a Governor who's eager to freeze property taxes. I think that's one of the best campaign promises I know of, and he's the kind of man who will keep that promise."", ""Florida needs a man who, as Governor, will be dedicated to law enforcement, to eliminate the threat of crime that causes concern among all those who live in this beautiful State. And Florida needs a man who can join with the Members of Congress in the great State legislature to make sure that our elderly citizens, our retired citizens still have an enjoyable, secure, and fruitful life, to let their own existence be meaningful as long as they live on this Earth.

It's necessary to have him in the Congress of the United States. He's a friend of mine.] And I hope that you will give him every support on November 7."", ""He's a man of courage.

And I know you're going to give him one of the greatest margins of victory of any congressional candidate in the United States. He deserves it."", ""I also want to recognize Bill Lehman, who, along with Claude Pepper, is one of the greatest friends that Israel has. He serves on the Budget Committee. He helped me get civil service reform. He's a loyal, dedicated man who is so well liked that he doesn't even have any opposition on November 7. And he's going to help all the other Democratic candidates, Bill Lehman. Thank you, Bill."", ""There are many of you here who have a great interest in Latin America, in foreign affairs, in peace and defense. And you've got a strong supporter and a strong fighter for the things in which you believe in Dante Fascell, who's one of the great congressional leaders in international affairs and who also takes care of his own district."", ""Well, you can see that we have in the Democratic Party a good team. I've been President now for less than 2 years, but I believe that we've done what you want your Government to do in many aspects of life in Washington. Do you want a government of which you can be proud, that fights for human rights throughout the world? [Applause] That's what we've tried to bring in Washington through our Nation's foreign policy."", ""There have been times in the past when we could not be proud of everything our President did or everything our Nation's Government stood for. But I think it's accurate to say now that throughout the world, we have raised high a banner of which we can be proud; a nation that in its domestic affairs and foreign policy is clean and decent and represents the ideals and commitments and principles on which our Nation was founded 200 years ago."", ""Do you want a government whose officials are honest and who are free of embarrassment and corruption? Do you? [Applause] That's what we're trying to bring to Washington."", 'This morning before I left the White House I signed a bill called the Ethics Bill of 1978. It requires that in the future, Presidents, Vice Presidents, Cabinet members, all top civil servants, all the Members of Congress, all the top members of the judiciary, all our judges, have to account for their net worth, their incomes, make sure that the public has available to them an assessment of whether or not that candidate or that public official is honest.', ""We've been fighting to get this legislation now in our country for over 20 years. It has not been possible until this morning. And from now on, your public officials will have to account to you, and it will not only make them honest, but it will keep them honest. And they'll have to prove it."", ""Let me ask you another question. Do you want a government that's able to put American people back to work? [Applause] Right on. I knew you'd say yes."", ""When I took over as President 21 months ago, we had 10 million Americans who could not find a full-time job. We had 7 million Americans who couldn't find a job of any kind. The unemployment rate was 8 percent. In the last 20 months, we have brought the unemployment rate down 25 percent. And we have also added, in doing so, over 6 million more jobs than we had when I was inaugurated President."", ""The Congress deserves a lot of credit for this, because they've emphasized not jobs in government, but jobs in the private sector, permanent jobs."", ""We still have a long way to go. Many of our young people, many of those who belong to minority groups still are not employed. And we want to be sure that in the months to come we give them an opportunity to expend their one life on Earth in a productive way and feel that they are part of society, doing a useful job in their life, not alienated from society because they can't get a job they want."", ""Let me ask you another question. Do you want a government that will get the regulatory agencies and government agencies' nose out of the private sector's business and let our free enterprise system work in the United States? [Applause] Well, that's the kind of government we're trying to bring you in Washington."", 'As I got off the plane at the airport a few minutes ago, I was met by Frank Borman, one of the great heroes of our country, one of the astronauts that went to the Moon, now president of Eastern Airlines.', 'When I came in as President, I promised that we were going to deregulate the airline industry, to make sure that we eliminated the artificial holding up of prices to those who wanted to fly on our commercial airlines. We have reduced those fares tremendously. The number of passengers has gone up greatly, and the profits for Eastern Airlines, Delta, Pan Am, and all the others have gone up as well.', ""I'm committed in the future to bringing deregulation to other industries and make sure the free enterprise system in our country has a chance to have competition, which is good for our industry and also good for consumers. That's another goal that we've set for ourselves, that if you'll help us, we're going to meet."", ""I've got two or three more questions to ask you."", 'Do you want a government that works hard to control the threat of atomic weapons, which could destroy us all? Do you? [Applause]', ""We're negotiating every day to bring about a good SALT agreement with the Soviet Union, to cut down the level of atomic weapons. And the Congress has already passed a very good nonproliferation bill which prevents countries who don't have atomic weapons from having them in the future."", ""Two years ago there was a general belief that the atomic genie was out of the bottle, that nobody could stop the spread of atomic weapons. But we've been successful so far. And I believe that next year we'll have a chance to approve in the Congress a SALT agreement that will give our Nation less atomic weapons but greater security in the bargain."", ""And I'd like to ask you another question. Do you want to make sure that the United States is always number one in military strength? [Applause] That's what we've got now, and that's what we're going to keep, because with strength comes the ability to use our influence in a beneficial way around the world."", ""Our country is now respected by others. We are no longer the butt of all the jokes. We're no longer the target of all the attacks by the small nations, the weak nations, the new nations, the nations whose people might be brown or yellow or black. We've spread our influence in a beneficial way, and we've let our potential adversaries, the Soviet Union and others, know that we're going to stay strong."", ""But strength is not just military might. It's also economic strength. It's also political strength, based on freedom and the right of each individual person to make one's own influence felt."", ""Let me ask you another question. Do you want a government that can cut down the Federal deficit? [Applause] I thought you'd say that, too."", ""When I was running for President down here in 1976, our budget deficit, Federal deficit, was $66 billion. The first year we cut it down to the fifties of billions of dollars. The Congress and I have now cut it down a little below $40 billion. And before I've been in office one more year, we're going to cut the Federal deficit down below half what it was when I came in office. And we are going to continue to work for a balanced budget for your Federal Government."", ""Do you want a government that cuts your income taxes? [Applause] Okay, okay. Last year, we cut income taxes $8 billion. This year, the Congress has already passed a bill that would cut our income taxes about $19 or $20 billion more. When I get back to Washington and get that bill, do you think I ought to sign it? [Applause] I'll take your advice. I've decided to sign the bill."", 'I\'m just going to ask you three more questions. One is, do you want a government that will keep our social security system sound? [Applause] Well, as you well know, 2 years ago, when I came down here to campaign among you, the first question I ever got from retired people or those who were approaching retirement were, ""Is the social security system going into bankruptcy?""', ""At that time, in 2 more years, our social security system would have been bankrupt. Now the Congress has a social security system that will be sound and secure and dependable the rest of this century. And I can predict to you that forever, as long as any of us live, we're going to have a social security system on which you can depend."", ""And now, the two most important things: There is a great challenge that presents itself to us that we have not yet solved. I talked about it to you 2 nights ago; the anti-inflation program that I outlined is badly needed. It's tough. It's necessary. It's fair. With the exception of peace for our Nation and the security of our Nation, next year the most important responsibility which I will have on my shoulders is to control inflation."", ""There are going to be a lot of special interest groups who are selfish, who will not want to join me in controlling inflation. As you well know, the ones who suffer most are the ones who live on a fixed retirement income, who have very low-paying jobs, or who are insecure. I want to ask you to help me every way you can to join in against the inflationary threat to us, and if you will join me and help me and point out those who violate the guidelines I've set down, which are fair, then I believe we can have success."", 'Will you help me fight inflation this next year? [Applause] Good deal.', ""And the last question I want 'to ask you is this: Do you want a government that will help bring peace to the Middle East? [Applause] Very good."", ""We've made good progress, as you know. The people of Israel, the people of Egypt want peace. They have two courageous leaders, President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin. I want peace as well. And we've had an excellent relationship to date. It's not going to be easy to conclude the details of a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. I need your help, your support, and your prayers."", 'I believe that we can be successful. But I think that this is one of the greatest opportunities that any President has ever faced, to bring to that troubled land in the Middle East peace, which has escaped those people for thousands of years.', ""We'll be negotiating, starting again tomorrow. The Israeli delegation returns to Washington this evening. Secretary Vance will be working on this almost full-time. I will help when my help is needed. And I pray that before Christmas, I will be going to the Middle East to join in signing a peace treaty that will bring permanent, good relations between ancient enemies, Egypt and Israel."", ""Well, you can see that we are trying to do our best. We've had some successes, some partial success, some great challenges still ahead of us. I want to have a government that can be justifiably proud of what it is. I want to make sure that our Nation has a reputation of being clean and decent. I want our strength to depend upon the finest characteristics of the American people. I hope that you will help between now and November 7 to encourage all your friends, all your neighbors to vote."", ""In 1960, two-thirds of the American people went to the polls to vote. In recent elections, two-thirds of the American people did not go to the polls and vote. It's important that you do so. If you will help me to elect these fine candidates whom I've come down to Miami to help, we can make a great nation of which we are all so proud an even greater nation in the future."", 'Thank you very much. God bless all of you.']"
12,Jimmy Carter ,"October 28, 1978","['Governor Carey, Senator Moynihan, Congressman LaFalce, Congressman Nowak, National Democratic Chairman John White, Chairman of Erie County, Joe Crangle, Mayor Griffin, and my good friends who gave me a strong support when I was running for President and have given me a warm welcome this morning in spite of the cold weather:', ""I'm glad to be back with you. Thank you very much."", ""I know how difficult it can be to be an incumbent President or Governor in these days. I'm sure New Yorkers will know what I mean when I told the political Democratic rally in Maryland not long ago that just since Camp David, Americans have been waving at me with all five fingers. [Laughter]"", ""And I think it's the same way with Hugh Carey, who came into office facing tremendous problems for New York State. You needed a man with courage, who was not afraid to tell the truth, even though sometimes it was 'not politically popular. You needed a man who was honest even when it hurt. You needed a man who thought taxes were too high. And for the first time in many, many years since I can remember, in New York State taxes are on the way down. Hugh Carey has reduced income taxes $1.3 billion."", 'I think the most serious problem that I saw in New York State when I campaigned here in 1975, 1976, was the economy, jobs. Everywhere I went, people would tell me, ""My father—my uncle-my son—my wife—cannot get a job."" Since Hugh Carey has been your Governor, the unemployment rate in New York State and here in Erie County, as well, has dropped 35 percent. It\'s still on the way down, thanks to this man.', ""When I was Governor of Georgia, 25 percent of my time was spent with economic development, bringing in new industry, new jobs, strengthening those that were there. Hugh Carey has been very successful in doing this. And the thing I like about his administration is that he's had a well-balanced emphasis between New York City, which was in desperate trouble—and he's gotten it out of trouble-and upstate New York."", 'The community development program that used to provide Buffalo, for instance, with $8 million, will now provide you $24 million. Hugh Carey knows the Congress. He can work with Hank and John and Pat to make sure that your voice is heard clearly and strongly in Washington.', ""One of the things that had been dragging out for years and years was social security claims. And since Hugh Carey has been Governor, New York has now been awarded from the Federal Government in back claims $214 million. That's money that was going to come out of your pockets; now it's paid back to you because you deserve it."", 'Hugh\'s very generous, too. One of the things that causes him political problems is he\'s not the kind of politician who runs forward and says, ""I did this; I did that; I claim credit for the good works that you have seen."" He was very generous in giving me and Midge Costanza and my son Chip credit for moving rapidly to deal with the serious problem of the blizzard in Buffalo. But Hugh Carey was a man who called me on the phone immediately and said, ""Mr. President, we need some help."" And because I knew him and trusted him, and I knew his good relationship with your congressional delegation, with your mayor, your Erie County chairman, I was sure that he spoke for the people. And so I sent Chip up here, and we dealt with the blizzard problem.', ""Love Canal was a problem I didn't understand. I was not here living with the contamination problem. But Hugh Carey, with his sensitivity, jumped on it right away. And I have to tell you that he's done a lot more at the State level than I and my people have done at the Federal level. And I want to express my thanks to him for dealing with your problem."", ""If you can get wet, so can I. 1 [Laughter] I just want to mention a couple of other things, because I want to be brief. I don't want you to get wet any more than you have to."", '1 It had begun to rain, and the President declined the use of an umbrella.', ""We are now trying to deal with inflation. It's my biggest single domestic problem. One of the things that I want to be sure the Congress does next year is to pass a hospital cost containment bill, because hospital costs have been going up in this country. Hospital costs have been going up twice as fast as the inflation rate. But Hugh Carey, with his dynamic leadership, has passed the best hospital cost containment bill in the Nation, and I hope to get just half as good a bill through the Congress next year as Hugh Carey has already gotten for you here in New York State."", ""The taxpayers of New York State are enjoying the lowest Medicaid cost of all 50 States—the lowest of all 50 States. That's quite an achievement. Hugh, I have admiration and thanks for what you've achieved."", ""Let me say that he needs your help. He's got a tough, hard race, as was the case with myself when I started running for President. He started out as an underdog, because he was dealing with thankless problems. And as I said before, he's the kind of person—you noticed in his introduction to me, did not claim credit for anything. But he's got a tough race on his hands. And I hope you'll recognize that he's a sound leader knowing local, State, and Federal Government; that can work with Hank, that can work with John, that can work with Pat, that can work with me, and give you a better life in a great State in the years ahead. Help him on November 7. He and I together will help you the next few years. I won't say how many. [Laughter]"", ""Recently, the world was thrilled by the selection of a great new Polish Pope. Maybe you heard about it here in Buffalo. [Laughter] I had very limited authority to appoint a delegation to go to Rome. You can imagine how many thousands of people wanted to go, and there could only be a tiny group. But I looked around the leadership of Congress to try to pick people that I thought were representative of the great Italian Americans and the great Polish Americans of our country. And it didn't take me long to decide that John LaFalce and Henry Nowak ought to be the ones to represent me."", ""As you know, in the selection of a Pope, when a Pole won, you couldn't also have an Italian at the same time. But you are lucky here in the Niagara frontier to have a good Pole and a good Italian American to serve you in Congress. That makes a great combination that can't be beat. And I might say with Pat and Hugh, you've also got some winning Irishmen to make out a ticket very well. [Laughter]"", 'I don\'t believe that any new Senator has ever arrived in Washington and made a greater, more beneficial impact for his people back home than Pat Moynihan has done. As you know, he is eloquent. He is courageous. He is dynamic. And when he speaks, people listen. He has analyzed, in the most definitive way, how Federal laws ought to be changed to make the allocation of your tax money back to you more fair. He\'s been to see me many times about this. And when he speaks, the southern Members of Congress, those from the Sun Belt, say, ""Well, I think it\'s fair to give more public works money, more transportation money, more welfare money, more education money, more highway money to those areas like Buffalo, like New York, which have in the past been deprived.""', ""I have a great admiration for Pat Moynihan. He's a sound man, a good man, an inspirational man. And not only is he superb in domestic affairs, but he has that rare combination of being very knowledgeable in international affairs as well. And I hope you'll keep him in the Senate as long as he wants to stay, because he makes a good partner for us to serve you better."", 'Pat, I want to express my thanks to you.', 'Just a word about my own administration. And I can be much briefer about this. [Laughter]', ""When I came into the White House about 21 months ago, we had 10 million Americans who couldn't find a full-time job. Seven million had no jobs at all. We've cut the unemployment rate already 25 percent. We've added 6 1/2 million net new jobs. We've cut the unemployment rate, the unemployment numbers, 1 1/2 million."", ""We've given better services to our people, stronger defense, better highways, better education. We've tried to give what people need, because I spent 2 years learning what our Nation hungered for. At the same time, we've cut taxes. Last year we cut your income taxes $8 billion. And with Pat's help this year, we've evolved a tax bill that will cut your income taxes about $20 billion more."", ""It's not been easy. It's not been easy to give better services, a stronger defense, revise our programs to benefit you and cut taxes at the same time."", ""There's one other thing that bothers me, though, and that's the Federal deficit. When I was running for President in 1976, the Federal Government deficit was more than $66 billion. We've already cut it down over $25 billion. And by the end of next year, we will have cut the Federal budget deficit more than half."", ""We are working on it some more. And my goal is still to balance the Federal budget. If you'll help me, I believe we'll be able to do it."", ""We've reorganized the Government. This week I signed an ethics bill, passed by the Congress, that requires all major public officials—Presidents, Vice Presidents, Cabinet members, all the Members of Congress, the Federal judges—to reveal to you every year what their net worth is, what their income is, where it comes from, just to make sure we remove all temptation for Federal Government officials to perform illegally or to betray your trust in them."", ""We have reorganized the Federal Government. We've tried to bring some order into the civil service system. In over 95 years, 'nobody had tackled the civil service system. We've got fine, decent, even self-sacrificial public servants. They want to do a good job. But they couldn't do it, because the bureaucracy had them constrained. You'd have two people sitting side by side at adjacent desks, one of them competent, eager, hard-working, conscientious; the other one either incompetent or lazy. They got the same recognition, the same salary, the same promotions. And you could imagine how this affects civil servants."", 'So, we passed a reform bill, first time, as I said, in 95 years. Now that good employee will be rewarded, and the other employee will either be inspired to do better or be transferred or fired. And we also are going to make managers manage.', ""The most serious problem that I have other than the security of our Nation is inflation. I'm determined to keep Federal spending down. I'm determined to keep the bureaucracy efficient. I'm determined to encourage State and local governments to join in with me to get the Congress to pass legislation like the hospital cost containment bill that didn't pass this year."", ""I'm determined to inspire employers to hold their prices down and workers, knowing that prices are going to be held down, to restrain their wage demands. I need your help in doing this. It's not going to be easy. It's not going to be quick. But it's vitally important that we succeed."", ""One thing we are trying to do is to get the Government's nose out of the people's business. I believe in the free enterprise system. I believe in the free enterprise system, but too long, the regulatory agencies, that were designed originally to protect consumers, have been cheating consumers and protecting the very corporations that are so powerful that they were supposed to regulate."", ""We've tried a good experiment this year. With the Congress help, we've worked on the airline industry. We have deregulated the airline industry. Rates went down. Passengers and goods hauled went way up. Profits went up as well. And that's just the kind of thing we're going to do in the future to other industries."", ""So, if you will help me, we'll control inflation together, and that'll solve the last major domestic issue we have. It'll also provide more jobs in the process. Will you help me with that? [Applause] Right on. I thank you."", ""And now I'd like to close by saying this: On international affairs, of course, this is a unique responsibility of a President, to keep our Nation strong. Militarily, we're the strongest nation on Earth. We're going to stay there. We are going to stay there, because, through strength, we can use our influence, which is tremendous, around the world, not only to keep peace for our own people but to give peace to others."", ""We're negotiating now a SALT agreement with the Soviet Union to cut down the threat of nuclear weapons destroying us all. The Congress passed a very good bill this year, nonproliferation, it's called, to prevent nations that don't have atomic explosives from ever having them."", ""We're working in Africa to try to bring peace there instead of bloodshed. And I'm very thankful that since I've been President, not a single American has shed blood in any foreign conflict, and I hope to keep that record until I go out of office."", 'We have become the champions of human rights. We are not scorned and despised as we formerly were. The United States has become an object of admiration. And we had some success, as you know, at Camp David recently.', ""We are moving toward peace in the Middle East. It's slow, it's tedious, it's not sure. We still need your encouragement. We still need your prayers."", 'We\'ve had trouble in recent hours with the Israeli settlements issue on the West Bank. The Egyptians had decided to withdraw their negotiators. I contacted President Sadat last night and said, ""Leave your negotiators in Washington."" He sent me word this morning, ""I\'11 do what my friend Jimmy Carter asked me."" They\'re going to stay there and negotiate.', ""But we've still got a lot of problems in our country. But I'd like to ask you, in closing, not to forget about the strength of our country. Every day there are some things about which you can complain, a little aberration in the normal progress of our great Nation. But God's really blessed us. He's given us the strongest nation on Earth, the most freedom that anybody can have, a chance to use our talents as we see fit, economic blessings of all kinds, rich land, and great influence around the world."", ""And if you will help me and keep a Democratic team together that's strong and forceful, depending on you for our authority and our incumbency, we'll make the greatest nation on Earth in the future even greater."", 'Thank you very much.']"

Because of his ability and his knowledge of New England, particularly Massachusetts, he was chosen to serve on the ad hoc committee to develop a new energy bill. And you couldn't go wrong and you won't go wrong Tuesday after next when you elect Paul Tsongas to be the next Senator from your great State."", ""You've got a good Democratic team in Ed King and Tommy O'Neill. They believe in holding down property taxes. They're tough enough to deliver on promises. They believe in making the city stronger, and they are for the working people. And I hope you'll give them your strong support."", ""I think you know it's a balanced ticket, and the Democratic Party is certainly broad enough to encompass those who might disagree on some issues. But they believe that their strength, politically, their counsel, when they're in office, will come to you, and I hope you'll give them your strong support."", 'I\'d like to talk just a few minutes about my own administration and the importance of a Democratic team. When I went in office 21 months ago, we had 10 million people in this country who could not find a full-time job. We had 7 million people who could find no jobs at all. When I campaigned through your State in \'75 and \'76, through Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, the most important single question asked me was, ""Can we put our people back to work?"" The Congress and I have worked hard at this with the help of great Governors like your own Mike Dukakis, with Governors around the country.', ""We've cut the unemployment rate already by 25 percent. We've added a net increase of 6 1/2 million jobs. The unemployment rate has dropped l 1/2 million, and we're going to keep on until every person in this country who wants a job can find a job. That's our great task, a very important one."", ""In Lynn, your employment has gone up twice as fast even as the national average that I've just described to you."", ""We've lowered taxes. Last year we lowered your income taxes $8 billion, this year almost $20 billion more. We've added good services—for you, the highest increase in allocation of money for education in the history of our Nation. We've also had good programs, as you know, for highways. We've strengthened our country's defense. We're improving the allocation of funds to areas like your own, where the need is greatest. We're rebuilding our cities. We formed a good partnership between local, State, and Federal officials. At the same time, we've seen a need to make our Government more efficient, more effective."", ""One of the big problems that we had was with our civil service. It was formed 95 years ago. It had never been changed nor improved. Quite often we would have two Federal workers sitting side by side. One would be competent, dedicated, hard-working. The one sitting next to him or her would be incompetent or lazy. With the new civil service reform, we're going to recognize the hard, dedicated worker, and the ones who haven't been working well are going to be reinspired, transferred, or fired. And we're going to let managers manage, and in the future you can depend on your Government being more effective and more efficient."", 'I think all of you remember just 2 or 3 years ago there was a great dissatisfaction, even distrust of our Federal Government by the people of this country. After the war in Vietnam, after the Watergate scandals, after the embarrassments of the CIA, there was a great feeling that public officials could not be trusted. I advocated that we require a change in accountability of public officials to you, the people of this country.', ""Under the great leadership of Tip O'Neill, the Congress passed and I signed just this week a new ethics bill. It requires the President, the Vice President, the members of the Cabinet, all top employees in the executive branch of Government, every Member of Congress, all Federal judges, to reveal their net worth, to let you the people know how much income they have and where that income comes from. So, from now on, there will be much less temptation to violate the laws or to do something embarrassing or unethical, and that's a great step forward, thanks to your Speaker and my Speaker, Tip O'Neill."", ""In addition to better services and lower taxes, I was very concerned in 1976 about the high Federal Government deficit. When I ran for President, the Federal deficit was over $66 billion. I've not been in office yet 2 years, but the Congress and I together have already reduced the deficit by $25 billion. I'm now preparing the 1980 fiscal year budget. I'm going to cut the Federal deficit to less than half what it was when I was elected."", ""And with the help of the Members of Congress, we've dedicated ourselves, with a strong economy, to having a balanced budget for the Federal Government of the United States in the future."", 'The biggest problem that I have and that you have still on our shoulders is to control inflation. It robs those who are least able to afford it. The other night I spoke to the Nation on television to outline what I would do as President, what business leaders and employers would do to hold down prices below 6 percent increase per year.', 'I asked the working people of this country that if we are able to control government waste and spending and hold down prices to also hold down their wage demands. It is going to be a very difficult undertaking. I need your support, and I hope the people of this country will rally to me to control this blight on our economy, give us a stronger nation that can keep jobs coming to us by holding down inflation.', ""I would like to say one other thing in closing about international affairs. It's very important for our country's military capability to be strong, because with strength comes confidence and influence in the rest of the world. We've tried to provide leadership that in the past was missing. We've not felt a necessity to endorse and support every tinhorn dictatorship around the country [world] 1 that violated human rights. We've tried to raise a banner for our country to follow of common decency, honesty, and self-respect."", '1Printed in the transcript.', ""I think we've been successful to a great degree. As you well know, in times gone by, every time the United Nations met in the fall of the year in New York, our country was embarrassed by being the target of every attack, the butt of every joke. This is no longer the case. And I believe that the nations of Asia, Europe, Africa now see us as a nation that can be trusted, a nation that's strong, a nation that's going to stay strong."", ""We're negotiating every day with the Soviet Union to bring about a SALT agreement to reduce the threat of atomic weapons that hang over our heads, those of the Soviet Union and indeed the entire world. The Congress has already passed a bill that was called the nonproliferation bill to keep nations who don't presently have atomic weapons from getting them."", ""The Republican Senator from this State has said that he wants us to put a moratorium on negotiating with the Soviets to limit nuclear weapons. This would be a serious mistake, to stop trying for world peace, to stop trying for nuclear weapons. And as long as I'm in the White House, we'll continue to negotiate to keep our Nation's strength, to cut down on nuclear weapons, and eliminate this great threat from the entire world."", ""I'm grateful that since I've been in office, not a single American member of our Armed Forces has shed blood in a foreign country. And I hope I can go out of office at the end of my term with that record still intact."", ""But we're not trying to bring peace just to our own country. We're trying to bring peace in other troubled areas of the world. In Southern Africa, in Namibia, in Rhodesia, in Cyprus, wherever there's a threat of bloodshed that might spread to other countries and eventually to us, we are working day and night to try to alleviate tensions, to eliminate hatred, and to 'build up friendships."", ""One of the most complicated and longstanding disputes in the entire world, as you know, is in the Middle East. There's no doubt in my mind that the people of Israel want peace. There's no doubt that the people of Egypt want peace. This also applies to those who live on the West Bank, in Jordan, in Syria, in Lebanon."", ""We've already made some progress. President Sadat, Prime Minister Begin have been very determined and very courageous in seeking common ground on which they could build an agreement. Lately, we have had some problems with the settlement issue on 'the West Bank. There was a chance yesterday that the Egyptian .delegation might withdraw. They had orders to do so. But I contacted President Sadat. This morning, he sent me word that his delegation would stay here and continue to negotiate until there's a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. And I hope before this year is over, I can go over and sign a peace treaty with those two, bring peace to that troubled region."", ""I'd like to emphasize that the Presidency is sometimes a lonely job. And it's only with a team effort that I can be successful, that the Congress can be successful, that gubernatorial and local officials can be successful in meeting your needs in an effective way."", ""We have been making progress in lower taxes, better services, a more open government, more effective delivery of the things that you need in your own lives. We've built up our Nation's defense. We've increased the influence and the esteem of our own Nation around the world. We've protected human rights, and we're working hard toward peace. We've put our people back to work, and we are trying to control inflation."", ""Every one of these issues, many others like them, are very difficult. It requires the support of you and people like you around the country. I can be much more effective in domestic and foreign issues if when I speak, foreign leaders and others know that I don't speak with a hollow voice, that the Congress gives me its backing and that you support me in my efforts to lead this Nation. I hope you'll support the entire Democratic ticket in Massachusetts."", ""The next 9 or 10 days will be very important to you. I hope that you'll make a small investment of time, money, and your influence to shape the kind of government you will have in the future and elect these fine candidates who have already been chosen in an open, free, democratic primary."", ""Please do this, because I want to see the Democratic team stay together which has served you so well in Massachusetts. We've got the greatest nation on Earth. If you'll help me and the others on the stage with me in the future, we'll have an even greater nation, the United States of America."", 'Thank you very much, everybody.']"

Will you do that? [Applause] Thank you very much.', 'Last week I made a speech about inflation. And the next day I told Mike Blumenthal that I was coming to Wall Street for a rally, and Mike Blumenthal said, ""If there\'s one thing that Wall Street needs, it\'s a rally."" This is a tremendous one for people; it\'s a tremendous demonstration of your interest in your own government.', ""One thing that I'd like to say today is this: I come here as your President, as President of all the people of our country, Democrats and Republicans. One thing that has been of great concern to me in the past is the tremendous decrease in the number of people who care enough about our Nation to vote on election day. In 1960 two-thirds of the people of our country voted. Recent elections have shown that two-thirds of the people of our Nation do not vote. We live in trying times, times when public servants who are elected by you need to know that you care about our country."", ""I'd like for you to think back, just for a few minutes, 2 or 3 years ago when I first came to New York State, to New York City, to campaign for President. Your city was in a state of crisis. Bankruptcy was the immediate prospect for you all. When I walked the streets of your city, there was an attitude of despair; the spirit of New York was lost."", ""But things have changed under the dynamic leadership of a courageous man-Governor Hugh Carey. He's a man who knows how to form and to use a team based on the principles of American democracy. Working with Pat Moynihan and the congressional delegation from New York, working with Mayor Beame and now Ed Koch, Hugh Carey has let me know, as President, what I could do to help your city and to help your State."", ""Shortly after the election in 1976, even before I was inaugurated, Hugh Carey and your mayor came down to Georgia to talk to me and to outline in specific terms what the Congress and the President could do, if we cared, to resolve New York City's financial crisis and to put this State back on the road to prosperity."", 'Hugh Carey inherited a State deficit of a billion dollars. You now enjoy a State surplus of $600 million. Hugh Carey saw that taxes on your shoulders were too great. He has reduced State taxes $1.3 billion.', ""Hugh Carey cares about people, people of all kinds, and he's provided services to you, a strong anticrime program to make your streets and your homes safer."", 'Hugh Carey was concerned about the unemployment rate in this State, and the unemployment rate in the last 21 months has dropped in New York State 35 percent.', ""He's a Governor who .believes in economic development of all kinds, all over New York, and he's a man who believes in tough, competent fiscal management. Hugh Carey is one of my staunchest allies in trying to fight against inflation."", ""We tried unsuccessfully this year to get a hospital cost containment bill through the Congress, because costs of hospital care have gone up twice as fast as the very high inflation rate in our Nation. I was not successful. I'm going to continue to fight next year. And a beautiful pattern for us to use in Congress is what Hugh Carey has already .done in New York State."", 'There was 1 State among all 50 last year where the costs of hospital care went down. Do you know what State that was? New York—the only one. The next best State in holding down hospital costs had an increase of 9 percent. You, now, in your State have the lowest Medicaid cost of any State in our entire Nation.', ""These are the kinds of things that quite often have not been emphasized enough by Hugh Carey, who's a modest man. But we require a Democratic team, and we require the ability to work together, and particularly we need to have your trust, your confidence, and your support."", 'This is a very close election in prospect for you in November. Hugh Carey was in Congress 14 years. The people there trust him; they trust Ed Koch. And they know that those two men who serve you are thoroughly aware of the congressional procedures and also thoroughly aware of the needs of New York City and New York State.', ""I'd like to point out one other thing: We have a great population in New York of leaders from almost every nation on Earth. This is a living demonstration, in your great community of millions of people, of how basic human rights can be achieved here through good services, jobs, lower taxes, safer streets, equal opportunity, which can be used as a pattern for other nations around the world."", 'When I have a problem in dealing with international affairs—bringing human rights to Northern Ireland, bringing human rights and peace to the Mideast—I know that I can refer to and depend upon the advice and the counsel and support of your great Democratic Party leadership here—Hugh Carey, Ed Koch, Pat Moynihan, and others.', ""It's a very great influence that you enjoy in helping to guide me in making decisions that affect your own ancestors, your own relatives, in troubled areas of the world."", 'November 7 is a time for you to take a few minutes and to express your views of support for good leaders, particularly Hugh Carey and his good team, and also to show this country and the rest of the world that you have confidence in the future of our Nation and that you are willing to invest a small portion of your time and effort to let your voice be heard. It strengthens me in dealing with your problems to know that you care enough to vote.', 'I believe the best way to make sure that we have equitable and fair treatment in our country for average citizens is to make sure that on election day your voices are the ones to be heard. The voice and influence of powerful, selfish special interest groups are always heard through high-priced lawyers and very effective lobbyists.', 'The time for the average citizen to let your voice be heard is on election day. And I hope there will be a demonstration next Tuesday that you really care.', 'When I was elected President, we had 10 million Americans who were looking for a full-time job and could not find one. The unemployment rate was 8 percent. In the last 21 months we have added a net increase of 6 1/2 million jobs and cut the unemployment rate 25 percent.

If you care about the maintenance of this effort and the success of it, then on November 7, next Tuesday, you will vote."", 'We have strengthened our democratic influence around the world by bringing our allies to our side in military matters, in political matters, and—in a vivid demonstration of cooperation yesterday-in stabilizing the dollar, controlling inflation, and having a strong, growing economy in our country. If you care about our Nation having a good relationship with our allies, in meeting our own needs and their needs around the world, then on November 7, next Tuesday, you will vote.', ""We've got a good path laid out for ourselves. The Congress in the last few days has finally passed, for the first time, a national energy policy. Our deficits have been drastically reduced. We've got a good, sound anti-inflation program announced and making good progress."", 'Our trade deficits are going down. Our exports are going up. The prospect for the future looks good.

15,Jimmy Carter ,"November 02, 1978","['Senator Don Riegle; Congressman Dale Kildee; Speaker Bobby Crim; Mayor Rutherford; your next United States Senator, Carl Levin; your next Governor, Bill Fitzgerald; and my good friends from Flint, Michigan:', 'It is true that almost exactly 2 years ago at the end of a long 2-year campaign in all 50 States, Vice President Mondale and I chose this auditorium to close our campaign effort. We came here for sound reasons. Flint is a famous community, the birthplace of one of our greatest corporations-the greatest on Earth, perhaps-the epitome of what it means to be an honest, decent, hard-working American, the birthplace of enlightened labor leadership, and a place which epitomizes in the finest way what our Nation is, what our Nation has been, what our Nation can be in the future.', 'It was mentioned that 1960 was the year when John Kennedy was elected President and was the last year that Michigan chose a Democrat to be Governor.', 'In 1960 two-thirds of the American people went to the polls the first week in November to vote. The projections are that next week, two-thirds of the American people will not vote. This rally today is an opportunity for me as President of all the people of our country, Democrats and Republicans, to remind you of the great responsibility that we as Americans have to demonstrate that we are able to manage our own affairs, to run our own government, to set our own standards, to form a team, and to make a great nation even greater in the future.', 'Will you help me next week by electing this Democratic ticket and going out to vote? [Applause]', 'I am going to breathe a sigh of relief when Carl Levin comes to Washington as your new United States Senator.', 'There are many problems which I have as President of our great country. One is to fight inflation, which has been hanging over our head and putting a burden on the working people of this country for the last 10 years. This is not an easy assignment. It requires cooperation from labor, from business, from agriculture, from the private homeowner. It also requires the most intense cooperation from your own elected leadership.', ""Carl Levin's opponent has already discounted the effort to fight inflation. I believe that you want a United States Senator that will help me help you control inflation. Is that right? [Applause] Very good."", ""I worked hard for 2 years to be elected to this office I hold, because I wanted to be President of the United States. I cast my lot, when not 1 percent of the American people had ever heard my name, with workers in factory shift lines, with people on street corners, with elderly, retired citizens, with young students, with those who believe that our Nation could be better, could be more honest, could be more decent, could be more filled with justifiable pride than was the case 2 or 3 years ago, when our Nation had been embarrassed with the failures of a Republican administration, when our farmers were facing another recession, or even depression. Prices were down. Every month or two the Republican administration would declare an embargo against the sale of American grain products overseas. And I pledged in my campaign and never, as long as I was President, would we ever embargo the sale of American farm products to foreign markets, and we'll never do it. And we are now setting records every year in the export of farm products overseas."", 'We also had a problem with unemployment. When I was elected President, we had 10 million Americans who were looking for a full-time job and could not find it. Seven million Americans could not find a job at all. Congress helped me, and we set a goal for ourselves to add new jobs to the American societal structure.', 'Since then we have had a net increase of 6 1/2 million new jobs. The unemployment rate is down 25 percent; in Michigan, 35 percent. It needs to come down further, and I need a United States Senator there to represent Michigan, along with Don Riegle, who wants to be Senator, who will work at it, who will help me get the inflation rate down, help me get better life for farmers and put our people back to work.', ""Carl Levin will not be my man. He has proven that he's a man who is not afraid to fight powerful political figures, and Carl Levin is not afraid to fight the bureaucracy. He has proven this in his own community, and he will prove it, when he gets to the Senate, for the entire State of Michigan and also for the country that we both love. It's very important to control the bureaucracy, to cut down waste, to initiate ethics, and to make sure that our public officials are honest. Carl Levin is a man who's not afraid to tackle the bureaucracy, and I need somebody that will come there and work full-time with me to bring some order out of government."", ""I'd like to remind you of this: Now the polls show a slight advantage for the Democratic candidate for Senate. But the last few days can make a difference. I've seen it happen over and over and over the last 2 or 3 years, when people got complacent, took a victory for granted, and the Democrats got out-spent on television, radio, billboards, telephone calls, newspapers, the last few days."", ""Carl Levin's opponent will spend over $2 million on his campaign for reelection. Carl Levin, as is typical with Democrats, will spend about one-third that amount."", ""What can make the difference? Being a better candidate? Yes. We have that advantage. But what Carl Levin needs is friends, supporters, neighbors, those who believe in a greater Michigan, who will get out and work these last 4 days in a sacrificial way and be, in effect, every one of you, a campaign manager for the Democratic ticket. If so, we'll go over the top next Tuesday night."", ""I'd like to tell you about two things that happened to me in the last few weeks. One was last week. I was in the State of Connecticut. When I campaigned there 2 or 3 years ago, that State was quite discouraged. Industry was moving out every week. The unemployment rate was extremely high. 'Connecticut has a dynamic Governor, Governor Ella Grasso. She believes that the Governorship ought to be a place for dynamism, aggression, and a hard fight day by day to make her State better. She has brought in the last year 260 new industries and cut the unemployment rate in half."", 'I believe Michigan is ready for that kind of dynamic and aggressive fighter as a Governor, and we have that opportunity in Bill Fitzgerald. Will you help put him in office? [Applause]', ""He's raised legitimate issues. He's interested in a highly publicized health problem. He's taken the position that's responsible and courageous. He is a man who believes that the Governor's office ought to be a place for action. He's also a man of great respect in this entire country."", 'Recently, I had to send a small delegation to Rome to represent me as the President and our country as a nation at the funeral of the Pope, and I chose Bill Fitzgerald to go along with my mother and just a few others to represent our Nation. This is the kind of leadership we need. This is the kind of leadership we will have next year with Bill Fitzgerald.', ""He told me he only made one mistake on that trip, to play poker with my mother. He should not have done it. [Laughter] And because his personal finances and his campaign treasury were reduced by my own 'mother, I hope you'll help him even more this next 4 days to win his election."", ""Let me close by saying that we need in Washington a strong team. We need, as we relate to you, a strong relationship between your State administration and the Democratic team in Washington. We've worked hard to bring down unemployment in our country. We've got a long way to go. We are working hard to bring down inflation, which has been with us more than 10 years. We've got a long way to go."", ""Yesterday, I signed two bills that give the greatest Federal aid to education in the history of our country from preschool years, elementary, secondary, and aid to college students of all ages and of all incomes. We've also sustained a rate of growth of housing construction in our country, over 2 million per year. We've been sensitive in meeting the legitimate needs of our country, but we've also brought a new concept to Washington."", ""The Democratic Party has always been a party of compassion, a party that recognized that we needed to extend a hand to those who are less fortunate in our society, to let them be able to stand on their own feet, to make their own decisions, to support themselves, to play a role in government, to be respected members of a community. We still have that unique characteristic which has given the Democratic Party the support for generations of the working people of this country. But we've also realized that you cannot educate a child, you cannot feed a hungry person, you cannot build a home or repair highways with waste, corruption or inefficiency."", ""I believe in tough management. When I was running for President, we had a Federal deficit of more than $66 billion. In giving better services to our people, we have been able to cut the deficit down already by more than $25 billion. In the budget I'm working on now, we'll cut the Federal deficit more than half, and with the help of people like Don Riegle, Carl Levin, Congressman Kildee, we are working forward in the future to having a balanced budget for the Government of the United States of America."", ""How can you give better services, balance the budget without raising taxes? We've been able to do it. Last year, aided by the Democratic Congress, we cut taxes by $8 billion. This next week, as soon as I get the final bill from the Congress, I will sign it to reduce income taxes another $20 billion."", ""So, we've been able to give better services, cut the deficit and cut taxes, a pretty good achievement if I do say so myself."", ""We're trying to stabilize the value of the dollar. We had great luck yesterday by taking bold action to make sure that America is economically strong, that we are not afraid to make difficult decisions, and the rest of the world cooperated with us."", ""We've proved in the process that our allies and our friends will sustain the United States in a common effort to balance the world economic system and give us a more stable future. The Congress has now passed for the first time in our history a national energy plan to give us. adequate supplies of energy at reasonable and predictable prices, to cut down our imports of foreign fuel, let our Nation be self-sufficient, to shift us toward more plentiful supplies of fuel like coal, solar energy, to preserve the precious fuel oil, gasoline for use in mobile equipment, as is Constructed in your own State, and to give homes a chance to have an adequate supply of natural gas in the future. This is a great step forward, and we will continue to make our Nation strong in itself."", ""I believe that we can have a government that's efficient as well. For 95 years we've had a civil service system that steadily grew more and more bureaucratic in nature and which prevented good, qualified, dedicated, hard-working civil servants from being adequately rewarded. You would have two workers sitting side by side at adjacent desks, one, as I've just described, working hard, trying to do a good job, dedicated, efficient; another one unqualified, lazy, without motivation. They both got paid exactly the same amount, exactly the same pay increases, exactly the same promotion. There was no motivation for better performance, managers could not manage."", ""Now we've got a new civil service reform bill. We can reward the dedicated and competent employee in the Federal Government. The other one who's not been working well, we can inspire them to do better, transfer them to a more fitting job, or discharge them if they don't work. This is what I believe is best for our country. It's what we're going to continue to do."", ""I agree with the people of Michigan that we need a strong nation, not just politically, not just economically, but militarily as well. We have the strongest military defense capability on Earth. And as long as I'm in the White House, we're going to keep it that way—number one. It's going to stay that way."", ""We need to be strong so that we can maintain peace. This is important for our own country, yes. I'm very proud of the fact—and I hope I can go out of office still saying the same thing—that since I've been President, we've not had a single American in uniform shed blood in a foreign country. This is a notable achievement."", ""And it's true because we are strong, but it's also true because we are now repairing the damage that was done to our country, through the Vietnam war years, the Watergate scandals, and the revelations about the CIA. There's a new spirit in our Nation, but there's also a new respect for our Nation among the other countries of the world. We want to preserve peace for ourselves, yes, but we also believe that as long as we have a country that has a reputation for honesty, openness, decency, with a spirit and the ideals and the commitments on which our Nation was founded, that our influence can be beneficial and helpful in the other trouble spots of the world."", ""This is important to us. It's important to others. One of the great things that we have been able to do is to raise high the banner of human rights, and our country is now looked upon as the nation that stands foremost in the protection of basic human rights. And we'll have that reputation again as long as I'm in the White House."", ""Let me say that we've also tried, with some success, so far, to bring peace in southern Africa, to bring peace to Cyprus, to bring peace in the Middle East. A few hours ago in New York I was with Prime Minister Begin. Cy Vance, the Secretary of State, is meeting with him there all day today.

I might say that every aspect of a President's life is not pleasant. It's not easy. Sometimes decisions have to be approached with a great deal of trepidation and caution. Sometimes there are discouragements. Since the Camp David negotiations began, I've not taken any time off. I've been working on the weekends and also during the week."", 'One good thing about a President is that I can set priorities for myself. I can do what I think is the most important thing for the Nation that I love. And the most important thing to me at this moment is to see Abner Mikva return to Congress next year.', ""It's not an accident that many knowledgeable and distinguished Democrats come into this district to add their voice of support for Congressman Mikva. We all want to have a better nation. We all want to meet our responsibilities of public office."", ""It's an exciting thing to come tonight to see democracy in action, to see dedicated Americans who are willing to fight to have a nation that's even greater than it is. And it's an inspiration to me as President to be in a rally with this degree of enthusiasm and fervor and commitment and support and success that's going to be demonstrated next Tuesday night."", ""We've got a candidate for the United State Senate here, whom I've known for several years. When the Democratic Party has met in its annual conventions or its midterm conventions, we have chosen a man from Illinois, who was not well known even in his own State, to come and give us advice and counsel in shaping the policies and the goals and ambitions of our party in foreign affairs. And I'm very grateful to have a man here with me tonight who intends not only to continue using his great knowledge and ability and influence to have a better success in dealing with other countries but who has pledged himself to cut the deficit every year, to cut taxes—and he will—to have fiscal responsibility in his administration as U.S. Senator, and who's casting his own future on a door-to-door campaign for the Senate, and one whom my mother, Lillian, loves—Alex Seith."", ""My mother has been into Illinois twice to campaign with Alex. The first time she pronounced his name wrong. [Laughter] And she couldn't remember how to say it, and she finally remembered that Seith reminded her of Jimmy's teeth, and she got it right from then on. [Laughter]"", ""From that point on, his fortune has turned. And he has surprised and startled the political world throughout our country by the success of his campaign, because he's been sound, firm, strong, consistent and because he's cast his lot, not with powerful political figures, but with people on street corners and in their homes, when he's gone door to door to let you know what a United States Senator can be who cares about you and who will be a very fine partner for Adlai Stevenson."", ""There's also a young man that I've learned to respect, admire, and even love, a young man who comes from a family of immigrants, Greek immigrants, who came here believing in the future of our Nation, who knows what it means to work hard for a chance in life, who, through superb dedication, confidence, and ability and, above all, an understanding and a compassion for the average people of Illinois in particular, has come from nowhere in politics, who has never been ahead in any poll conducted before election night, who has never lost an election, and who will win next Tuesday night for Governor-Mike Bakalis."", ""I'd like to talk to you very quietly for a few minutes about some thoughts that are on my mind."", 'Four days before the election in 1960, the people of the Nation went to the polls to vote, and the outcome of that election hung on the results in Illinois. It was very close. John Kennedy was elected President of our country. In that election twothirds of the American people went to the polls to vote. In recent elections and the predictions for next Tuesday night, twothirds of the American people will not vote.', ""We've seen poll results—I have, as President, the last few days—that show that the Democrats on a nationwide basis have a substantial advantage over Republican candidates, on an average. That's all voters. But among those who are likely to go to the polls and vote, the Democratic advantage is slashed in half."", ""There have been a lot of upsets in elections in our country, particularly the last 3 or 4 years. Issues are difficult, complicated. Public opinion is volatile. People have a distrust of candidates. They think they promise too much or won't do a good job when they're in office or might lose touch with voters."", 'The outcome of the election next Tuesday night will depend upon how many supporters go to the polls and vote. This is the first time that Abner Mikva has ever been ahead in the polls, and, as you know, he has won by the narrowest margin time after time.', ""I came this afternoon from Flint, Michigan. Two years ago, the night before the election, I met Fritz Mondale—we had been campaigning independently, but we met together in Flint, Michigan, late at night, both tired, to try to convince the Michigan people to vote for us. And I recall then that in the primary in Michigan, where 50 delegates' votes hung in the balance, I carried that State by less than 2,000 votes, not even 1 vote per precinct."", 'Last election, 2 years ago, Abner Mikva was elected to the Congress by 201 votes, much less than 1 vote per precinct. It is important that those who have confidence in him care enough about our Nation to invest your own time and energy and effort in determining the outcome of the election.', 'It would be a devastating blow and a tragedy for the 10th District of Michigan—of Illinois— [laughter] —for the State of Illinois, and for the United States if Abner Mikva is defeated. Will you work hard with all your effort the next 4 days to get other people to vote, to vote yourself, to have elected the finest Congressman that we could possibly return to Washington—Abner Mikva? Will you do that? [Applause] Good deal.', ""I want to ask you a couple more questions. Take your coats off and roll up your sleeves. Let's get to work. I want to ask you a few questions. I want to ask you a few questions, and I'll be very brief."", ""When I was elected President, there were 10 million people in this country who were looking for jobs, who couldn't find a full-time job. Since then, with Democratic leadership depending on you for your support and advice and counsel and criticism, we have had a .net increase of 6 1/2 million jobs in this country. We've already cut the unemployment rate 25 percent. We've got a long way to go. Do you care enough about your Nation to work hard between now and November 7 to elect Congressman Mikva, so that he can help me put America back to work? [Applause] Good deal."", 'Jobs are important, but we also have very serious problems that we have not yet solved with inflation. I have spelled out to the Congress, to the American people, indeed, to the world, a commitment on my part to make sure that we get inflation under control.', ""I inherited a Federal deficit of over $66 billion. I'm now preparing next year's budget, and I will have cut the deficit more than 50 percent in 2 years."", ""We're trying to eliminate waste, corruption in government.

In addition to that, yesterday I signed into law the finest pair of education bills that have ever been passed in our country, to help from kindergarten, elementary, secondary schools, college-over $12 billion to give young people a better education in our Nation. We are not cutting back on good services for the American people."", ""So, we're cutting the deficit; we're giving better services; we're also cutting taxes. Last year we cut income taxes $8 billion. This year we're cutting taxes $20 billion more. That's a good combination-lower deficits, better services, lower taxes. I need your help to keep Abner Mikva in Congress. Will you work between now and next Tuesday to keep him there to help me carry on this program economically? [Applause]"", 'I just want to ask you one more question. Alex Seith, Mike Bakalis, Abner Mikva, as well as your incumbent Senator, Adlai Stevenson, would help me to form and to keep an outstanding Democratic team, a team of elected officials, responsible to you, to make our Nation as great as possible.', 'We now have the strongest nation on Earth—militarily, economically, politically.', 'Our political system has been damaged in the last few years. Think back 3 years ago. There was a great alienation of American people from government. We had been embarrassed by a war in Vietnam. We had been embarrassed by the revelations of Watergate. We had been embarrassed by knowledge that our own CIA had violated the law.', 'There was a general distrust of the American Government. Every fall, I dreaded to see the United Nations General Assembly meet, because I knew that the United States, the country that I loved, would be the butt of every joke, the target of every attack by two-thirds of the nations on Earth.', 'Farmers were facing another depression. Workers were discouraged.', ""These kinds of things had created in our own Nation's image a reasonable doubt among people of our country. We were attaching ourselves to every totalitarian government and tinhorn dictatorship possible, with almost no attention to the preservation and enhancement of basic human rights."", ""We now have the strongest military defense capability on Earth. We're going to stay number one. But we use it not to abuse other people, not to be a bully; we use this strength, combined with our economic strength and combined with our political and moral and ethical strength, to show the rest of the world that our Nation is honest, our Nation is competent, our Nation is decent."", ""And we have reraised the banner of human rights. And as long as I'm President, our country will be in the forefront and will be known by every nation on Earth as a people who stand and will protect and will enhance basic human rights everywhere on Earth. And you can depend on that."", 'For about 2,500 years the Middle East has been torn by distrust, by hatred, and by war. Finally, about a year ago, there was a move made by President Anwar Sadat to bring peace between Israel and Egypt. A very courageous Prime Minister Begin welcomed him there and exchanged visits.', 'But as you know, the peace talks broke down, and I invited both men to come to Camp David. They came, not because of me, not because of my influence with them, not because of my personal characteristics, not even because I was President of the United States, but they came because they realized that when I spoke to them either publicly or in private, that I did not speak with a hollow voice, that the Mideast issues for the first time had been openly debated. The American people had been involved in the debate. The Congress was part of a democratic team committed to peace in the Middle East. And they came trusting our Nation. We had good luck at Camp David as a first major step.', ""This morning I met with Prime Minister Begin. Cy Vance, Secretary of State, spent all day with him. Yesterday he was with the Egyptians and the Israelis. And I believe that our Nation's influence now, our integrity, and our influence is strong and sound and dependable enough so that working with them—courageous leaders-with your backing and involvement, we can finally bring peace to the Mideast. It's what I want."", 'And I want to ask you this question in closing: Do you care enough about world peace to invest part of your life—at least 4 days of your life—in electing candidates that you know will help and strengthen me as I try to represent you well in international affairs, to keep our Nation strong, firm, dynamic, trusted, and a major element for peace? Will you do that for me? [Applause] Very good.', ""It's good of you to come. It's good of you to applaud."", ""I would like to ask you to do something specific that's very easy. I would like for you to promise me that between now and Tuesday, that each one of you will contact at least 50 other people and get a promise from them that they will go to the polls Tuesday and vote—preferably for the Democratic ticket, but at least vote. Every one that will—think about it awhile; don't lie to your own President. [Laughter] But if you will promise to get 50 people to vote between now and Tuesday, would you please stand? [Applause] Thank you very much. You have made my trip worthwhile.Good luck. Thank you very much.""]"

In recent elections and the projections for next Tuesday, twothirds of the American people will not vote.', ""It's very important for all Americans to know that the government is yours, that candidates who know you will vote will be much more cautious about following your mandates and desires. And also you have a responsibility and an opportunity in a free and democratic nation to exercise your will at the ballot box."", 'Yesterday, I was in Flint, Michigan, the last place I stopped before the great election 2 years ago, when I was chosen to be your President. In the primary in Michigan, out of more than a million votes, I won by less than 2,000, which meant that less than one person per precinct decided who won that State. Last night, I was campaigning for Congressman Abner Mikva in the 10th District of Illinois. He won 2 years ago with 201 votes, less than one-half vote per precinct.', ""It's extremely important that if you care about your Nation that you work hard enough to get other people to vote and also vote yourself."", ""I'm very glad to come to beautiful Oregon. When Fritz Mondale, the Vice President, was here a few days ago, there were heavy rains. Today, when the President comes, there is no rain. You can see how much it pays off to have a President."", 'I would like to emphasize again the importance of your participation in the democratic processes.', ""It's not easy holding public office these days. I guess one of the most difficult jobs in the world is to ,be President of the United States. It's also one of the best jobs of all, because I represent the greatest nation on Earth."", ""It's getting better every day, with your help. We have a young, vigorous, dynamic, confident, competent administration. Our Nation is the strongest on Earth. It's the strongest militarily, and it's going to stay that way. It's the strongest politically, because we believe in the dignity of every human being, the right of people to stand on their own feet, to make their own decisions, to control their own government, to let their own individuality be expressed. And we're trying to spread this philosophy, this commitment, these ideals around the world."", ""We now have a country where people can trust the Government once again. I remember just 3 or 4 years ago when many Americans were ashamed of our own Government. The Vietnam war was one that turned many people against our own country; the revelations in Watergate, where many of the top officials, as you know, in our Government went to jail. The CIA wag violating the laws of our Nation. Corruption, scandal pervaded our Government. We've changed all of that. We're trying to bring a government of honesty, openness, and decency, of which not only we can be proud, but which will earn the respect of the rest of the world."", ""It's only through strength of character, it's only through strength economically that my own influence can be used, as your President, to bring peace, not only to our own people but to other trouble spots of the world as well. I hope that I can go out of office at the end of my term by saying what I can say today, that not a single American in uniform has shed blood in a foreign country since I've been President. We're going to try to keep that peace."", ""We've also raised high the banner of human rights, and as long as I'm in the White House, we will protect basic human rights, not only in our own country but in every country on Earth, and you can depend on that as well."", 'I want to tell you why I came to Oregon at this particular time. I want to let you know the importance of government, the importance of your participation, and also to get out as many people as possible to vote next Tuesday and to ask you to vote for a superb Democratic ticket, headed in Oregon by my good friend and a great Governor, Bob Straub. I want you to help him.', ""Some people say that Governor Straub is not a good politician because he takes difficult stands on controversial issues. And I think that's true."", ""Oregon is the birthplace of the referendum, where people can put on the ballot issues that you consider to be important to yourselves. He analyzes those issues. He doesn't try to guess what's the most popular thing to do. He's not wishy-washy in his own decisions. He lets the people know where he stands. He's a strong and courageous leader, and he's helped Oregon tremendously since he's been in office."", ""If he has one fault, it's that he's overly modest. When he came into office, Oregon had the fourth highest unemployment rate in the United States, 12 percent unemployment. Bob Straub has brought that unemployment down to 5 percent. He's cut it more than in half, and now Oregon is at the top in employment, not unemployment."", ""He's tried to protect the environment in Oregon at the same time—at the same time—he has helped to improve business and jobs. Seventy-two new businesses have been brought into Oregon to provide jobs for you and those you care about; 175 existing Oregon businesses have expanded. But at the same time Bob Straub believes that the good quality of life that is enjoyed in your State—and there is no better quality of life anywhere on Earth— ought to be preserved. And you need a Governor that'll keep your environment clean and make sure that the land is used well and the forest industry is protected, the forest harvests are expanded, that more trees are planted. And I hear this from Bob Straub every time I talk to him. And you need to keep him in office to protect you and the quality of your life in the future."", ""What kind of industry do you want in Oregon? Clean industry, right. That's the kind I want throughout the country, and Bob Straub is setting an example for other States to follow. I might point out that Bob Straub also believes in lower taxes, at the same time opening government so you can understand it better and participate in it, but giving better services to the people as well."", 'Many of you are still students, and Oregon now has the highest State support for education in over 30 years, which is a very good commitment and a better life for you and those you care about.', ""He's fighting for lower utility rates, lower rent for elderly people, and also fighting to give lower costs for dental care for elderly people. He believes, as I do, that we can tackle tough problems and be successful."", ""As you well know, Congressman Bob Duncan, Congressman Led AuCoin are very strong supporters of what I'm trying to do in Washington. I inherited, when I went into office, a very serious series of problems. We had over 10 million people in our country who could not find a fulltime job. Since then, we've had a net increase of 6 1/2 million new jobs. On the way here from Illinois this morning on Air Force One, I got a report that last month we added 642,000 jobs in our country, and we cut down the unemployment rate another two-tenths of 1 percent. It's now 5.8 percent, the best it's been in many, many years."", ""I've been concerned, as have you, about the stability of our own economy. I want to say just a word about the prospect for a recession next year."", 'In the last 2 weeks many economists, advisers of mine, have been predicting that if the American dollar was not stabilized on foreign markets, that inflation rates would go up much higher next year than this year and that we would face an almost sure recession.', ""Last Saturday night I met with my top economic advisers to consider what to do. And we made a decision that we believed then and believe even more strongly now would not only stabilize and strengthen the dollar overseas; it'll expand American export, create more jobs for American citizens, and make sure that we do not have a recession in 1979. This is what we believe we can accomplish. If you will help us with our anti-inflation program, we'll be successful. Will you help me with that by using all of your influence in the future? [Applause]"", 'This is a program that requires cooperation and teamwork from Democrats and Republicans alike, from employers and employees alike, from those who live in cities, those who live on the farms, because all of us have to make equal sacrifices to control rampant inflation.', ""We've had a very high inflation rate now for 10 years. The 3 years before I became President, we had an average inflation rate of 8 percent. It's not quite that high now, and we want to hold it down."", ""In the last 2 days, the value of the dollar has gone up against the deutsche mark, for instance, in Germany 8 percent. As you know, day before yesterday, the stock market went up more than it ever had in history, over 35 points. That's an indication of confidence in our Government."", ""When I began running for President, nobody thought I had a chance, but I stuck to it and won. When I made my anti-inflation speech— [applause] —with your help. When I made my anti-inflation speech, a lot of people said we don't have a chance to win. But I don't intend to lose, and we're going to fight inflation until we whip it. We're going to keep Americans employed. We're going to keep a strong dollar. We're going to keep jobs going, and our Nation is going to stand as a bulwark against depression throughout the world."", ""It takes a good team effort, a good Democratic team effort, and I want to ask all of you to think back—sometimes in a very brief life, since a lot of you are quite young—how things were 2, 3 years ago, before Bob Straub was your Governor and before we had a Democratic administration in Washington. We've still a long way to go. We haven't solved all our problems. We don't claim to have done that. But we are trying to recognize for a change that our Nation is one of which we can be justifiably proud."", ""Our military and economic and political strength is not being used to abuse other people. We no longer have any need to espouse every totalitarian regime in the world to make us look good. We've been willing to treat the Panamanians fairly. We've injected our beneficial impact into South Africa to bring peace, an end to apartheid, majority rule, one person-one vote in that troubled continent."", ""We're working to bring peace to Cyprus. We're trying to have a SALT agreement negotiated with the Soviet Union, to remove once and for all the threat of nuclear destruction from the entire world. And I intend to succeed in having a good SALT agreement in the next few weeks."", ""The Congress has passed a nonproliferation bill, the first time we've ever had one which will prevent nations that don't presently have nuclear explosives from ever having them.

And we're going to continue to work until we have a balanced budget for the Government of the United States."", ""Well, I want to come to a close in my own speech, to ask you first of all to participate by voting and encouraging other people to vote next Tuesday. Secondly, I'd like to ask you to vote for the Democratic candidates, and particularly those who are running a tough race against very high financial odds."", ""There's no doubt in my mind that Bob Straub's opponent will have two and a half times as many dollars to spend on his campaign as does your Governor. I want you particularly to help him to be elected, because Bob Straub is a man who deserves support, particularly from young people, who believe in the idealism of American life and the strength of our country and a good quality of existence, with good jobs, growing industry in the future in Oregon. That's very important. But most of all, I want you to make sure that you feel that you're a part of the American political existence. When you vote, your influence is felt. And I want to make sure that young people like yourselves, who are idealistic, who are not afraid of change, who believe in openness of government, who believe in principles that haven't changed for the last 200 years, who believe in courage in the face of difficulty, who don't believe problems are too great to overcome, who don't believe the questions are too difficult to answer—you are the ones on whom the future of the United States depends."", ""We have got the greatest nation on Earth now.

He recognized the mandate given to him last June, and he's followed that mandate, not only with enthusiasm and commitment but with effectiveness. He's been able to cut State spending $3 billion. He's been able to cut State taxes $1 billion. He's been able to return to local government, to hold down property taxes $4 billion. This is just a start. He's the kind of man that can lead you to even greater life in a greater State in the future, and I'm very proud to be here on his behalf."", ""We have a good partnership between the Federal and the State Governments. And also there's a great partnership that exists in the Jerry Brown-Merv Dymally team. He inherited a tremendous unemployment rate in California when he became Governor. But with Merv Dymally's help, there's been a great emphasis on restoring the economic soundness of the life of California."", ""There have been 1 million new jobs available for Californians with the Brown-Dymally team.

We are rapidly growing, very important constituency in our country. So far, the voter turnout among Americans who speak Spanish has not been high enough. It's a great hope of the future. And I want to encourage an increased participation in politics, particularly Democratic politics, by those whose ancestors were from Latin America, who speak Spanish, and who are enlightened, strong, representing the principles and ideals of a Democratic Party. Jerry Patterson—and I particularly want you to help Dennis Kazarian, Norma Bork, and in this area, I'm especially pleased to be here on behalf of Vic Fazio and Bob Matsui, who I'm sure you are going to send to the Congress in January."", ""Now I want to say a word about myself. I've come here as President of our entire country, Democrats and Republicans. In 1960 in the United States, two-thirds of the American people went to the polls to elect John Kennedy President and to vote for the Democratic ticket. Two-thirds voted. The projections for Monday, unless people are inspired to run their own affairs, are that two-thirds of the American people will not vote."", ""It's very important that you go to the polls and cast your ballot. It's not enough to come to a rally or even to work for a candidate during a long, tedious, trying, difficult campaign. Every time we have three people who do not vote, two of them ordinarily are Democrats. And when you have polled the opinion of all voters and then poll the ones who are most likely to vote, the Democratic lead in almost every election is cut in half."", ""It's important for us to project our own voice, our own influence, to assess our Nation's needs, and to help resolve difficult problems."", ""It's not easy being an incumbent in these days. But I think we've brought a new light, not only to California, under Jerry Brown's leadership, but to our Nation as well."", ""I'd like for you to think back just 2 or 3 years, at the situation as it was before we had a Democratic administration in Washington. Our Nation was discouraged. People had lost confidence in our Government. We were involved in a war in Vietnam. We had the Watergate scandals, when top people in our Government were being sent to prison. The CIA revelations showed that important elements of the American Government were violating the law and getting away with it."", 'When I became President, 10 million Americans could not find a full-time job. The unemployment rate was 8 percent.', 'Every time the United Nations General Assembly met in New York in the fall, we were all embarrassed, because our great Nation, which we love, became the butt of every joke .and the target of every attack by two-thirds of the nations on Earth.', 'We had lost our spirit. We were not identified as one that was trying to search for peace throughout the world. We were attaching ourselves to disreputable administrations in other countries in order to pursue doubtful political goals. We had lost touch with the idealism that made our Nation great.', ""We've tried to turn that around. We've cut the unemployment rate by 25 percent. We've added 6 1/2 million net jobs. We're trying to get inflation under the control. If you'll help me, we'll succeed."", ""We've now gotten the dollar back into a strong position. We've raised the banner of human rights. We've made sure that we're meeting the services of our people. We've cut taxes $28 billion. We're trying to bring some order out of chaos in the civil service system. We're letting the people who do a good job be rewarded, letting managers manage. We've cut the deficit almost 50 percent already. So, these kind of things on the domestic scene are the results of a good Democratic team."", ""I'd like to mention, as well, that we have the strongest nation on Earth. We're the strongest politically; we're the strongest economically; we're the strongest militarily."", ""We do have the strongest defense, and we're going to stay that way. But we use our defense strength not to abuse others, not to impose our will on smaller nations, but to work for peace—peace for ourselves and peace for others. Since I've been in the White House—and I hope as long as I'm there—there has never been an American in uniform who shed blood in a foreign country in conflict. And if you'll help me, we'll maintain that peaceful record."", ""We've raised the banner of human rights. And as long as I'm in the White House, our Nation will always be identified as the Nation that will insist and fight for basic human rights, not only in our own country but throughout the world."", ""We're searching for peace, as well, to remove the threat of atomic destruction. We're negotiating every day with the Soviet Union to have a SALT agreement, and I hope before too many weeks goes by, we will be successful. The Congress has passed a nonproliferation bill that prevents nations who don't have atomic explosives from ever having them in the future."", 'We are also searching for peace in southern Africa, to have majority rule, one person-one vote, an end to apartheid.', ""In Cyprus we're trying to bring the Greek- and the Turk-Cypriots into understanding, to bring peace to that troubled region."", ""And in the Mideast, I've been negotiating, as you know, with President Sadat, Prime Minister Begin. And if you'll stick with me and give me your voice, we'll bring peace to the Mideast in the next few weeks."", ""Let me summarize what I want to say in just a few words. First of all, this is your country, ours or your governments at the Federal, State, and local level. Your voice cannot be heard unless you're willing to vote and to get other people to participate in the democratic processes."", ""It's always a mistake to take for granted a political victory. Some of the Democratic candidates are far ahead in the public opinion polls. I've seen, in the last few days of a campaign, those apparent victories turn into disappointment and defeat. Other Democratic candidates have very close races, because their opponents can outspend them with an almost unlimited political campaign chest."", ""We are trying, as a Democratic team, to meet the needs of our people, to strengthen the income of American farm families—which has increased already 25 percent—to increase farm exports, to have predictable government policies. We're trying to bring peace to ourselves and to the world, maintain a strong defense, put our people back to work, cut down inflation, stabilize the dollar, have a strong economy. These are the kind of things that benefit all those who live in this Nation. And above all, we're trying to have a government that's honest, decent, trustworthy, admired by other people in the world, known as one that protects human rights and protects peace, of which the American people can be truly proud."", ""It's important that you keep this Democratic team together. It's important that you participate Tuesday by giving us your vote and your support. And I ask you to do so, to make the greatest nation on Earth even greater in the future with a strong Democratic team and you being part of it."", 'Thank you very much, everybody.

One of the best things that happened to me was shortly after the Ohio, California primaries, a young man, compared to me, came down to Plains and said, ""I\'ve just finished reading your book, Jimmy, called, \'Why Not the Best?\', and I\'ve offered to volunteer my services to be your Vice President."" [Laughter]', ""That's not exactly the way it happened, but I wanted to come back to Minnesota and thank you for Fritz Mondale, the greatest Vice President I know."", 'Elections are exciting; elections are precarious, unpredictable; elections are times when the people of the country which we all love have an opportunity to be part of government, to stand on our own feet, to make our own decisions, to show what democracy means, to show what freedom means, what individuality means.', 'In 1960, our country went to the polls, and we elected John Kennedy as President. Two-thirds of the American people voted. The projections are that Tuesday, this year, two-thirds of the American people will not vote.', ""Tonight, I'm going to discuss some of the reasons for that, but I would like to point out to you that when three people don't vote on election day, ordinarily, two of them are Democrats, because Democrats quite often are those who have newly arrived on the scene of full citizenship. They are people who quite often have come up out of poverty, who might be black, who might not speak English very well, whose parents have only been here a short time, who have recently got a job or recently' finished an education, who have recently become interested in politics and government. So, a strong vote on election day almost always ensures that people like DFL candidates, Democrats throughout the country will be elected."", ""There's a real reason for the fall-off in voter participation, and I'd like to ask you to think back 3 or 4 years about what our country was. There was a great alienation, distrust, withdrawal by the people of our country from their Government."", 'We had been embroiled for many years in the Vietnam war; 50,000 young Americans had died. Watergate, an unprecedented scandal in our Nation, resulted in revelations day by day which were an embarrassment to us all. Top officials in the heart of our Government—in the White House, the Attorney General, and others—not only were embarrassed but were guilty of crimes. Many of them went to prison. Our CIA was accused, with some basis, of plotting murder and violating the law.', 'Our farmers were facing another Hoover Depression; income was down. When we had a slight surplus in feed grains, food grains, in a completely unpredictable way, the leaders of our Government would declare an embargo and would not let us ship our goods overseas to world markets.', ""When I became President, 10 million American adults could not find a full-time job. Seven million Americans couldn't find a job at all. In your region of Minnesota, the unemployment rate was 9 percent throughout the Iron Range, Northview, and here in Duluth, the unemployment rate was 9 percent."", 'Mayor Beaudin told me tonight the unemployment rate here is less than 4 percent; the same throughout the northeast.', 'We saw in times gone by a time when the elderly people were beginning to worry about their own future. Social security, which had begun under a Democratic President many years ago, was facing immediate bankruptcy.', 'These kinds of things had torn at the very fabric of our country. And I, as a Governor and a candidate for President, shrank up inside every autumn when the United Nations General Assembly began its deliberations in New York, because I knew that the country that I loved was likely to be the target of every attack, the butt of every joke by two-thirds of the nations on Earth. We were not beloved, we were not even respected by every nation that was small or new or weak, or whose people were brown or black or yellow.', ""Our country had lost its spirit. But there was a hunger within us and a strength within us that was indomitable, and we began the long journey back. It was not an accident. It's not been easy. We have not yet won all the battles. We've not answered all the questions. We've not solved all the problems."", ""But the progress that we have made has been because of a strong team spirit, a spirit that epitomizes what Hubert Humphrey's life meant, what he stood for, a concern about common, ordinary working people who don't want a selfish benefit from government, but just want a chance in life to be an individual, to take whatever talent God might have given us and use that talent to the utmost, to be free and proud, proud of ourselves, proud of our family, proud of our country. That's not asking too much. And that's what we've tried to bring back."", ""Your State is known throughout the Nation as setting an example for the rest of us in honesty, in decency, and concern about one another, voter participation. This is what we need to have Tuesday. But we can't take anything for granted. I doubt if any time in recent years has there been a threat that the Governor's office, both Senate offices might go to the Republican Party, responsible for that kind of America that I've described in a very few words."", ""Miners now have a good life. The social security system is sound. In the last 21 months we've added 6 1/2 million net new jobs in our country. We've cut the unemployment rate down by 25 percent. Day before yesterday, I signed two bills, the most progressive and far-reaching help for education in the history of our country-over $12 billion that will now go from the Federal Government into better elementary and secondary education, better aid for students who want to get a college education and who couldn't otherwise afford it."", ""At the same time, we've not been wasteful. The Democratic Party has always been a party with a heart, we've always been compassionate. But we've also built very laboriously, recently, a reputation for competence, for efficiency, because you can't educate a child, you can't feed a hungry person, you can't build a house, you can't have a good school system with waste and inefficiency."", ""I was concerned, as a responsible fiscal person, because when I ran for President, we had a deficit of over $66 billion. We've already cut that deficit over $25 billion. And the budget I'm preparing now for submission next year to Congress will more than cut that deficit in half. And we're trying to work for a balanced budget."", ""At the same time we've been careful about your own pocketbook, not just concerned about deficits and better services, but we've cut taxes $8 billion last year in income tax cuts, another $20 billion this year."", ""We've tried to bring to you the elements of life that Americans have a right to demand and which epitomize what you've had here in Minnesota with an enlightened and a progressive government."", ""i wouldn't say that I'm tired, but I haven't had much rest since we began the summit talks at Camp David. And I didn't have to come here tonight, because I'd like to be going back to Washington to be with my family for a change. But I've come here, and so has the Vice President, because I care about what happens in Minnesota Tuesday night when the election returns come in. It's important to the country. And it's a completely legitimate thing for a President to care who the Governor of a State is and who the Members of the Senate are."", 'We didn\'t get where we are by giving up. And in the last few weeks I\'ve heard some of the most important and prominent and even loyal Democrats from Minnesota saying, ""I\'m afraid we\'ve lost one of our Senate seats. I\'m afraid we have an insurmountable obstacle to overcome."" That\'s not the spirit of America. That\'s not the spirit of the DFL. It\'s not the spirit which I try to epitomize as President.', ""Many of you come here tonight because you are loyal, and I appreciate your being here. And perhaps you've worked hard in the past elections to have DFL nominees elected. You've proven that with the superb public servants that you've elected to represent your State here and also in Washington."", ""But it's not a time to give up. We've 3 more days, and there's no reason why everyone here tonight shouldn't put in 30 hours on the telephone, walking the streets, asking your family, your neighbors, your community to support the candidates Tuesday night and win a victory for Minnesota and for our country."", ""We are not a nation that's ever surprised when we win a victory, because there's a spirit within our country that far surpasses in most cases what government is. But I'm afraid that in your State this year, because of divisions within your party, that your public officials might be better than the people themselves. And I've come to ask you not to let them down. They are great nominees. They're different from one another. Fritz Mondale and I are different from one another. He has constituencies that I'm not very familiar with, and so do I have people who know me better than they know him. But we work as a team with our differences intact, and out of that comes strength."", ""I spent last night with a Croatian family in Chicago, Mayor Michael Bilandic. His parents haven't been here long. I met his mother. She doesn't speak English very well; I could hardly hear what she said. But she said every night she kneels down beside the bed, and she prays for me as President. And she prays that our country will be even greater."", ""Marty Schreiber comes from next door in Wisconsin. He's running against a cute Republican candidate who said the other day that elderly people are millstones around the neck of young Americans. That's the kind of philosophy that represents the Republican Party. It's the kind of philosophy that's brought me here to you tonight. I don't consider my mother to be a millstone around my neck. And I don't believe you consider your parents to be that either."", ""I've got great burdens on my shoulders. I asked for them, and I enjoy my job. But I need help in Washington and also in the State offices of this country from people who share a common philosophy with me. We intend to continue to put Americans back to work, to add jobs, to give people the basic right to support themselves, to take whatever talent or ability God might have given them and use it in a useful way."", ""We're trying to control inflation. When I became President, we had an average inflation rate for the preceding 3 years of 8 percent. It's a very intractable problem. It's not easily solved, but I announced last week a strong anti-inflation program, and as I had a philosophy during the campaign, I did not intend to lose, I don't intend to lose in the fight against inflation if you'll help me, and I hope you will."", ""I'm a farmer. I come from a working family. My family happens to have been in this country 100 years before it was a nation. We've lived in Georgia for more than 200 years. No one in my family before me ever finished high school. I know what it means to work for a living. I know what it means to have a better chance in life, and I want to be sure that the Government continues to give good services to our people. But I deeply believe that the best government is the one closest to the people."", ""I think there are roles to play for the Federal Government that can be enhanced, for we need a Federal Government that the bureaucracy is a source of pride and trust. When we inherited this job, the civil service was 95 years old and had not been reformed. It had deteriorated in quality. You'd have two people sitting side by side, one dedicated and competent, hard-working; another right next door at the adjacent desk, incompetent, lazy, in the wrong job."", ""The Congress has now changed that. We've got civil service reformed. Now we can reward that good employee. We can inspire the other one or maybe transfer the other one or maybe discharge the other one. We can let managers manage. We'll have a better Government for you. The budget is coming under control. These signs of progress mean that we have a competent government that's still compassionate."", ""Wendy Anderson, for instance, serves on the Budget Committee.

Our Nation is the strongest nation on Earth militarily. And as long as I'm President, our Nation will always be number one in military strength, and you can depend upon that."", ""It just happens that Wendy Anderson is on the Armed Services Committee, and he realizes that we don't just need a strong defense for the safety of America. We certainly don't want .a strong military to impose our will on others. We want a strong defense because we love peace. There has not been a single American who has shed blood in combat since I've been President, .and I hope I can complete my term as your President with that record still intact."", ""We are working every day with the Soviet Union to have a good SALT agreement, to remove the threat of nuclear weapons from their destructive power over the entire Earth. The Congress has passed a nonproliferation bill that prevents nations who don't have atomic explosives from ever having them in the future."", 'And we\'ve tried to set an example for others. We\'ve raised high a banner that represents the spirit and the commitment and the ideals of America, a banner that says, ""Human Rights.""

Hubert Humphrey, Muriel Humphrey have been inspirations to all of us. Wendy Anderson, Bob Short will make a great team in Washington to help me. Rudy Perpich, here, Marty Schreiber, great Governors, epitomizing what we know is best for our country.', 'If you want jobs, if you want inflation controlled, if you want to cut the Federal deficit, make government more responsive to you, give our farmers and city dwellers a better life, our children a better education, a government of which we can be proud, a statesman-like attitude toward foreign affairs, military strength designed to bring world peace to us and others throughout the world, then work hard the next 3 days, vote Tuesday, send a strong Democratic team to victory.

I've been out campaigning in the last number of weeks in 31 different States, recognizing how important it is to Democratic candidates to have a large vote. Since most of the Democratic voters are working people, quite often we are not inclined to vote as strongly and as eagerly as are the Republicans, because the special interest groups that really want something for themselves out of government are always the ones that are most eager to go and vote."", ""You've got a wonderful candidate, Maurice Dantin, and I really need him to be in the Senate to represent, first of all, the United States; secondly, Mississippi; and then third, of course, to help me on key issues as they come up in the Senate."", 'I was in Flint, Michigan, the other night, and I recall that I won the Michigan primary and got about 50-something delegates by less than one vote per precinct. And I went directly from there to the 10th District of Illinois, where the incumbent Congressman won by only 201 votes out of about 200,000 votes cast.', ""We've seen a very close race in Mississippi evolve, and I know that every vote will count. So, as President, I want to encourage all of you to do as southerners have always done, and that is to show that you run your own government and that your strong expression of opinion and will on election day is the guide for not only your future Senator, Maurice Dantin, but also a guide to me as President."", ""We only have a few hours left, the rest of the day and all day Monday, and then, of course, you can work on Tuesday as well. But there's no reason why everyone at this rally, 600 or 700 people, can't put in 15 or 20 hours of solid work between now and the close of election day Tuesday for Maurice Dantin and the entire Democratic ticket there in your State."", ""It's not enough just to come to a rally on Sunday afternoon and express your opinion that Maurice should be the next Senator. You know how close the race might be. And I hope that everyone there will promise this afternoon before you leave to put in 15 hours of solid work on the telephone, with your neighbors, in your community, at campaign headquarters, to get people to go and vote, and vote for Maurice Dantin. He'll be a great United States Senator. I'll certainly be proud to have him in Washington next January. And as President, I'm counting on you to express in a democratic way your right to control your own government."", ""So, thank you very much for letting me be part of this wonderful Sunday afternoon rally for a very fine candidate. Now our confidence has to be in you. I know you won't let me down. I know you won't let your party down. I know you won't let your country down.

My announcement could not be postponed. In just a few days, those who would enter early State primary contests must file as candidates, and then those of us who run for President must stand before the people for election.', ""During the campaign, we will take our record to you—what we have done in the past and what we propose for our Nation's future. We will be talking about a nation strong and at peace, about our demonstrated willingness to face tough problems with courage, about jobs provided for our people, and about restoring a sense of trust and confidence in our own Government."", 'With calm, strong, and effective leadership, with a prosperous and expanding economy, with inflation and energy shortages behind us, with people believing again, we can set our course for the kind of future about which we have all dreamed. I will discuss these themes with you, and I will do it effectively, but I will not do it tonight.', 'I was scheduled tomorrow to begin a week-long political tour to set the tone of the reelection campaign for 1980. It was also, to be frank about it, a money-raising trip. While there are certain clear advantages to campaigning as President, they are symbolic and historic rather than financial. The President, like all other candidates, needs campaign contributions.', 'My campaign travels must be, for a time, postponed. I must remain here, near the White House, because of the situation in Iran. While the crisis continues, I must be present to define and to lead our response to an ever-changing situation of the greatest sensitivity and importance.', 'I am proud—but not surprised—at the quiet unity of the American people over the past 4 weeks as we have faced this outrageous situation together. Not since Pearl Harbor, some 40 years ago, have we felt such a nationwide surge of determination and mutual purpose. But I must warn you that this crisis may not be resolved easily or quickly. It is possible that in the days ahead, our patience and sense of unity may waver as frustration builds up among us. I am determined to do everything I can to have the hostages released as soon as possible.', 'At the height of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln said, ""I have but one task, and that is to save the Union.""', 'Now I must devote my concerted efforts to resolving the Iranian crisis. The overriding fact is that 50 of our fellow Americans have been unjustifiably thrust into agony and danger, and I have a personal responsibility to get them out of that danger as fast as possible.', 'During this crisis I will, of course, continue to perform the many other tasks that are part of my job as President. And though I cannot yet campaign, myself, we will carry out our campaign duties as best we can under the circumstances. Vice President Mondale, my wife, Rosalynn, and members of my family, and other friends and supporters across the Nation will have to replace me until I can be on the campaign trail myself.

As President and as a candidate, I will continue to ask you to join me in looking squarely at the truth. I will continue to talk sense to the American people. Only by facing up to the world as it is can we lift ourselves toward a better future. There is no such thing as cheap energy, and never will be; that is the truth. We cannot wish our way out of inflation; that is the truth. We cannot spend our way out of every problem; that is the truth. We cannot toss aside a generation's work, patient work in the control of nuclear power, nuclear explosives, nuclear bombs; and that is the truth. We cannot have peace without a strong defense; that is also the truth."", 'If we act together in the unifying spirit of our deep and unchanging values, we can triumph together, and that is the most important truth of all.', 'With the support of the American people, I propose to carry on the struggle for a secure nation, for a just society, and for a peaceful world—and I intend to carry on this struggle as President of the United States.', 'Thank you very much.']"

[Laughter] But in this book we have the beginning of our strategy, and we have the beginning of our various precincts all over the country, we have our legal problems, we have our financial problems all for the general election, we have our get out the vote. So, the campaign, this is the first cut—the people on this staff here, working under Tim Kraft and Tom Donlion—the first cut of our 1980 campaign strategy really beginning to fall into final place now.', ""And so that now you have a feel of what we're doing, ladies and gentleman, I know I do not need to tell you my dear friends what a pleasure it is for me—and, I know, for you—for me to be able to present the President of the United States to his friends."", 'THE PRESIDENT. Thank you.', ""Bob tells me we have 1,553 delegates. Who would have dreamed 6 months ago that here long before we conclude the primary election campaign that we would have had this tremendous an achievement? The credit goes to you, and I'm deeply grateful to you. I will say that in the next few weeks and all the way through the fall, you will now have an active partner in the campaign, and maybe we'll do even better."", ""Political historians will record the tremendous achievement that you've made so far, running not a sectional or regional or limited campaign, but a nationwide campaign. We have not skipped a single State nor a single congressional district in the entire Nation; we've not skipped a territory. We've taken our message to the public, and we've listened; we've formed a good alliance with the people who vote and who make decisions in the Democratic Party. We've laid a good groundwork for the coming weeks and the coming months, and I'm deeply grateful to you."", ""What we have achieved was far beyond even our fondest expectations a few months ago. I don't know the exact figures. I think in the primary elections we've earned over 60 percent of the delegates; in the caucus States we've earned over 65 percent of the delegates against formidable opposition. And I'm very grateful for that as well."", ""Being an incumbent is not all it's cut out to be. [Laughter] There are a few advantages in being an incumbent, but there are some disadvantages. For the narrow-minded or the shortsighted, an incumbent President of this great country cannot deal in empty slogans, cannot deal in words, cannot deal in false promises, cannot deal in distortions of issues. An incumbent's stock in trade, particularly in an executive position, has to be in action-action dealing with the current problems of the day, action dealing in forging a policy and a spirit and an ideal and a commitment of an entire nation. An incumbent can't yield to the particular pressure of a regional or a local interest group. An incumbent has to deal with what's best for all the people every day."", ""We've faced some difficult challenges in the last 6 months. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, strengthening our alliance, marshaling support for our position that an invasion of an innocent country can't go unpunished. We've had to deal with the shocking violation of every international principle and law by the Iranians, who have captured and held innocent hostages imprisoned. We've had to deal with these issues with sensitivity and with courage, with commitment, with openness, with frankness, and the American people have been remarkably united and they've been remarkably patient when patience was necessary. And our country has also been very strong in its commitment to unchanging principles."", ""We've represented our Nation well in dealing with the problems of energy dependence, taking unprecedented steps to forge an energy policy based on conservation and the production of additional energy in our country. We've faced unbelievable inflation and interest pressures because OPEC prices went up 150 percent in 16 months, and we've been persistent in dealing with these issues on an equal basis with the Congress. Interest rates have dropped precipitously lately. The inflation rate is going to come down in the summer and make it easier for us. In the fall, we need some good news; I believe it will be coming."", ""But in all these multitudinous challenges that came upon us, some which had very devastating political potential, we've survived very well, because we've never forgotten that the Democratic Party is well named. It's the party of the people. And we have not forgotten those kinds of people who are particularly dependent on government and who have been the strength of our party down through the generations. This is a very important element of our collective strength. The trust that's been placed in our party has not been betrayed, and it will never be betrayed."", ""We've still got very important primary elections ahead of us. Every week, 1, 2, 5, 6, sometimes 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 elections in a single week, and we've had to deal with these diverse pressures without flinching and without betraying the principles that are widely publicized and which we hold so dear."", ""We're coming now to the end of a long campaign, and I want to make sure that the ending will give us a strong series of victories and leave us with a strong Democratic Party."", ""It's time for us to look forward, not backward. It's a time for us to heal existing wounds that are created in any tough Democratic Party election campaign and not create new wounds. It's incumbent on you and me to heal existing wounds, not to create new wounds in our party. It's time for us to pull the different elements of our party back together; to be generous in victory, to be strong, looking to the future, to be confident, to be united, to be determined, and not to fail. I do not intend to lose this election in 1980."", ""I've got a great running-mate in Fritz Mondale. And all of you who have worked so hard on the campaign—Bob Strauss, Tim Kraft, Tom Donilon, everyone over here—knows how much I appreciate the work you've done. This has been an excellent team effort, and I look for the future to be just as gratifying as the past has been."", ""I'll be out campaigning between now and the end of the primary season. And then we'll be preparing very eagerly to meet Ronald Reagan, or whomever the Republicans choose, and let the Nation know that we'll carry the Democratic banner to a tremendous victory in November."", ""Let me say this in closing. My sense, as I stand here before you, is one of gratitude and also one of a partnership. We could not have won this election had we not worked together. You've been over here in a relatively unrecognized way—luxurious working quarters. [Laughter] Maybe that made up for some of the low-paying jobs that you have. [Laughter] But we've never lost our temper, and we've never lost our sense of humor. We've come through some difficult times and some discouraging Tuesdays together, and they've always been followed by excitement and victory parties that have bound us back together again."", ""In my opinion, the issues have been thoroughly debated. There is no lack of knowledge among the American electorate about where I stand on any issue. We need not fear the Democratic convention. It's a place for debate; it's a place for discussion. And as we hammer out the Democratic platform, none of you need be afraid of the open and fervent debate, including the final touches on the platform that will be the base for victory for me and Fritz Mondale in November."", ""I want all of you to help me reach out a healing hand and a friendly hand to those who've not supported us so far. We'll need them in November, and with their help, our victory will be even greater than it has been so far. So, together, as future partners, we'll have the same kind of results in the months ahead as we've had in the months past."", 'God bless you, everyone. I look forward to working with you.']"

I've been waiting a long time for this moment. And there is no place in the world I would rather be right now than Columbus, Ohio, because there's no place that's any better to speak to the heart of America than right here in the heart of America. And I have to admit there are some other reasons that I'm glad to be here. [Laughter]"", 'My final victory in the primary season in 1976 in Ohio convinced the Nation that I would win the nomination of the Democratic Party, and I want to thank Ohioans for that. Secondly, at the 1976 convention in New York, the delegate votes of Ohio put me over the top as the Democratic nominee. I want to thank you for that. And on election day in the fall of 1976, the votes in Ohio made the difference between another 4 years of Republicanism and the return of a Democrat to the White House, and I and the rest of the American people want to thank you for that.', 'And next Tuesday, Ohio will make a decision that will give me a nationwide majority of the Democratic delegates again, and I want to thank you for that in advance.It is good to be back, and I could not ask for a better man to introduce me and to welcome me back—a bolder pioneer, a finer statesman, a great son of Ohio—than Senator John Glenn.', 'In the fall of 1944, when President Roosevelt was running for reelection, he said that he would not campaign, but he would take the occasion to correct any errors that his opponents made about him and his administration and his record. Although I will, of course, campaign this fall, now is a good time to set the record straight, not only about my own record but also about the strengths and the achievements of the United States of America.', 'Let me ask you a few questions. The answers might surprise you. Of all of the industrial powers, which nation has the highest productivity per worker? The United States is the answer. Another one: Of the major developed nations on Earth, which one was the only nation to meet our goal of reducing oil consumption by 5 percent in 1979, compared to 1978? Which nation did that? The answer is the United States. And during the 5 years since OPEC declared its oil embargo in 1973, among the major oil-consuming nations-our country, West Germany, France, Great Britain, Japan—listen closely to the question—which is the only nation to have a net increase in manufacturing employment? The answer is the United States, right.', ""Another question: During this exact same period, the same countries, which of these nations had the greatest increase in industrial production? Anybody know? You're right: the United States of America. Here's one you could probably answer just as well: Which nation has added in the last 3 1/2 years more than 9 million new jobs? The United States, again. And I might say that 350,000 of those jobs was right here in Ohio. Which nation is the strongest and at peace? The United States. And which nation is going to stay the strongest and stay at peace? The United States."", ""I'm here today to talk sense to the people of Ohio and to the people of the United States of America. It is time to set the record straight about our Nation and about our future. We do live in a time of challenge; we do live in a time of change; we do live in a time of danger. But in every area of change, in every area of challenge, in every area of danger, because of our courage and strength, America is turning the tide."", ""We're turning the tide in energy from a nation which has been overly dependent on foreign oil to a nation which is determined to be energy secure. We're turning the tide on the economy from a nation suffering along with other nations of worldwide inflation and from escalating interest rates to a nation determined to bring inflation under control. And we're turning the tide in foreign policy as well from a nation which was paralyzed by a tragic Asian war and by a scandal at home to a nation which is determined to meet the challenge of the future no matter what it brings to keep the peace and a nation that's proud of protecting the principles on which our very lives are based."", ""First, let me tell you how we are turning the tide on foreign policy. For years, Americans were divided. We were unsure of our purpose in the world. But today we are united not only in defending our Nation but in defending the principles on which we stand. We're united in the determination that America must be strong; strong militarily, strong economically, and strong morally. And today, the people of the United States are not ashamed to say that we are proud and that we love our country.We've got some challenges ahead of us, there's no doubt about that. And I want to describe very briefly to you some of those challenges and what we have done and are doing to meet them."", ""For more than 15 years, as John Glenn well knows, the Soviet Union maintained a steady upward growth in its military strength, while our own Nation failed to meet this challenge adequately. Now the United States is leading its allies in a steady, sustained growth in defense expenditures, not just for the last 3 years but with a commitment to the next 5 years and beyond. We have turned the tide in military strength. As long as I'm President, our Nation will be ready and determined to use our great strength for peace, for peace, to stand up for security, to stand up for our people, and to stand up for our unchanging principles."", ""As a world leader—and that's what we are—as a superpower—and that's what we are—we are meeting aggression and terrorism with peaceful means. When possible, we meet these challenges with other nations at our side. But I can tell you that on occasion, if necessary, to meet those challenges of aggression and terrorism, we will stand alone if necessary."", 'Over the most difficult possible obstacles and with great predictions that we would fail, we are now turning the tide on energy. For years our Nation was more and more a captive of the oil-producing nations. Each year we imported more and more oil. Each year more of our wealth flowed out of our country to buy that oil. We paid a great price for this, and we are still paying that price. As we send billions of dollars overseas to pay for foreign oil, we import inflation, and we also import unemployment. We allow our Nation to become dependent on the undependable and addicted to the unaffordable.', ""To cut oil imports, we must do two things: We must produce more energy in America, and we must conserve energy. Last year in this country, we cut gasoline consumption by more than 5 percent. So far this year, we have cut oil imports by 12 percent. That comes to a reduction of 1 million barrels of oil per day. Under new legislation—and I want to thank you for what you've done for that—under new legislation passed by the Congress with John Glenn's help, we are at long last moving in the right direction."", ""Now, for the first time in our Nation's history, we will have a national energy program to put us on the road to energy security. It's more ambitious than the space program, the Marshall plan, and the Interstate Highway System combined. It will replace foreign oil with American ingenuity and with Ohio coal. And it will take billions of dollars that now go to foreign countries to pay for their oil to create new energy sources and new American jobs here at home. This will be an exciting and a challenging time for all of us."", ""We're also turning the tide on the economy. The biggest single cause of our economic problems is energy. As long as we send those billions of dollars overseas to pay for foreign oil, we hurt ourselves, as I've said, in two ways: first, through inflation, because inflated oil prices go all the way through our economy and all the way through our land; and second, through unemployment, because the more money we send abroad, the less we have to invest and to spend at home to increase further the productivity of American workers."", ""High interest rates, as you well know, have hit the automobile and the homebuilding industries a severe blow. We are facing up to these economic problems. We have moved strongly on a broad-based front since the second week in March with an anti-inflation program, which is very successful, to cut interest rates and inflation. The results speak for themselves. Interest rates are now moving down rapidly; the inflation rate is also beginning to come down. And I tell you flatly, with the perfect knowledge that if I make a mistake it's going to hurt me, I make this prediction: that the second half of this year, beginning in the summer, the inflation rate is going to go down too, and you can count on it."", ""For the first time in 12 years we are working to balance the Federal budget. But we must do it right, with fairness and with compassion. Within the context of a strong defense and a balanced budget, we are fighting right now, today, in Congress, to meet the recession that's impending with expanded Federal assisted housing, with new job programs for young people, and aid to distressed urban areas. Because we have taken the right steps, we are building a brighter economic future for our country, a future of stable economic growth and of self-reliance and a better life for all those who live in our great land."", ""In each area—in foreign policy, in energy, and in the economy—there are no easy answers. We face major challenges, but we are turning the tide. We are demonstrating what we can accomplish by what we have accomplished already, with your help. In every area of challenge, I'm convinced that America can finish the job. I'm convinced of that because I know what we have already done together."", ""Our Nation has acted with firmness and with determination against aggression in Afghanistan; against terrorism in Iran; against dangerous reliance on foreign oil; against inflationary government spending. And we've acted together as a nation also for peace here at home and in the Middle East; for human rights at home and abroad; for a strong defense; and for the dignity of our senior citizens, our minority groups, our young people, and for all working men and women."", ""I'm not here to say that all my decisions have been right or popular. I know that they have certainly not all been easy ones. But I will say this: In the last 3 1/2 years we have been tested under fire. We have never ducked nor hidden. We've tackled long-term problems that have been with us and overlooked or deliberately ignored for years. We've made tough decisions, and we've taken the heat when we made those decisions. But we've done what was right, and we've always told the truth."", ""As long as I'm President, and as long as Fritz Mondale is Vice President, that's something you can count on, the truth. We will always talk sense; we will always give it to you straight. And also as long as I'm President, the Government of the United States will be committed to those fundamental principles that hold our ever-stronger Nation together; freedom, democracy, compassion, and human rights.

25,Jimmy Carter ,"May 29, 1980","['President George Forbes, my good friend Dr. Reverend Otis Moss, ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters:', ""I'm glad to be back here in this church. I came here as a candidate; I was received with open arms. I'm back here as President now, received again with open arms. Reverend Moss is a very discerning person. He knows protocol; he understands the status of human beings. The last time I was here, he took me into the community center, and this time, as President, he's let me come in the sanctuary. [Laughter]"", ""He made a beautiful speech a few minutes ago, and I'm going to take it as my text. The first time I heard Reverend Moss preach was in a sad congregation at the time of the death of Martin Luther King, Sr.'s wife, Mrs. Martin Luther King, Sr. He only spoke 5 minutes. I believe it was the best sermon I have ever heard. I doubt that he's preached a 5-minute sermon since then. [Laughter] But it was beautiful."", ""And tonight, before I begin my own remarks, I would like to report to you that I have, just a few minutes ago, talked to Shirley Jordan, the wife of Vernon Jordan. His father, his mother are there with her in the Fort Wayne Hospital. I had a long conversation with Dr. Jeffrey Towles, who's the surgeon who has ministered to our brother, Vernon Jordan. He reports that he was the victim of a critical wound. He's in the intensive care center. He is in satisfactory condition. He needs intense medical care, and he needs our prayers. And I would like to ask all of you for just one minute to stand, and let's pray for the quick recovery of our brother, Vernon Jordan."", '[Pause for silent prayer.]', 'I thank you very much. Amen.', ""My first thought when I heard about this attack, which I believe was an assassination effort—I was filled with a sense of outrage and a sense of sadness. I've known Vernon Jordan for a long time in Atlanta; we worked together. I was the Governor; he occupied a major position in shaping the lives of poor people and black people throughout the Southeast by giving them a right to vote. He was planning then to run for Congress. He later decided, as you know, to go to the Urban League. He's been a severe critic of mine on occasion, and I've listened to him very closely. I've been to his home; he's spent the night at my home, and we're close personal friends."", ""It's ironic that his life should be attacked, because he has spent it and will spend it in the future fighting against the causes of violence. He realizes that we must have an end to bloodshed and the hatred in this country, whether it's based on religion or race or ethnic divisions. That kind of hatred resulting in violence can destroy us all."", 'We live under a Constitution that promises us life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, equal opportunity, but we also know that our Founding Fathers wrote in that we should ensure domestic tranquillity. Martin Luther King, Jr.—I know his wife was in this church recently—said, and I\'d like to quote something I wrote in the hotel room a few minutes ago: ""Every crisis has both its danger and its opportunities. The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands in moments of challenge and controversy.""', 'We know where Vernon Jordan has always stood, and we know where, if our prayers are answered—and I believe they will be—he will stand in the years to come.', ""As President I have a great responsibility. I'm the chief law enforcement officer of our Nation. I'm the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. But I'm also the person charged with the responsibility to alleviate the causes of dissension and despair and hopelessness and hatred."", ""Reverend Otis Moss has helped me a lot. He's been to the White House twice in the last 2 weeks. The last time he came there I couldn't be with him, because a volcano erupted in the southern part of the State of Washington. I went out and saw the terrible destruction that resulted from that act of nature. It had the force of a hydrogen bomb, with 10 million tons of TNT, 500 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in Japan to end the Second World War; 150 square miles of beautiful forestland leveled, devastated. And I flew over it. And I was impressed then with the power of God."", ""And I was also reminded of something else that Martin Luther King, Jr., said. He said man is not flotsam and jetsam on the river of life; man is the child of God. And the trust that we have in our institutions, in our families, in our communities, in our Nation and our religious faith, can tide us over difficult times. We are not the first ones who've faced difficult times; we're not the first ones that sought for full freedom; we're not the first ones who've sought to find the promised land."", 'Moses led the Israeli people out of Egypt to seek freedom, and they were happy and delighted when they crossed the Red Sea and wound up in what they thought was safety. But they wandered for a long time. They didn\'t reach their destination immediately. They turned against Moses. They began to complain about the manna and the quail and said, ""We haven\'t got the things that we used to have: fruit and fish and wonderful foods."" But they forgot about the freedom that they had found, and they forgot about the slavery that they had escaped. But they continued on a long, hard road.', ""As Otis Moss pointed out a few minutes ago, after 244 years the American people, and particularly the American black people, have not yet reached the promised land. But we're on the road toward the promised land."", ""To reach our goals is not going to be easy; it's not going to be simple—it never has. Sometimes it's required suffering, sometimes it's required patience. It's always required courage and determination and a sense of unity and a maintenance of our degree of faith."", ""We want our people to have good health. We don't yet have adequate health care in this country. But the programs for women and infants and children, if the present budget proposals are carried out, will be six times greater than they were the last time I stood in this church."", ""We're making progress down the road together, but I don't claim that we've yet reached the promised land. We want our children to have a good education and take the ability and the talent that God gives them and nourish it and develop it and then be able to use it."", ""God knows and you know and I know that one of the greatest deprivations ever perpetrated against black people in this country was the segregated schools and the absence of a quality education. Special programs for disadvantaged children are quite often not provided by local and State governments. Those have had to come from the Federal Government. In the last 3 1/2 years, since the last time I stood in this church, we have increased those programs three times over. We've not yet done enough. We've not yet reached the promised land, but we're making progress together in a constant, steady, determined fashion."", ""We want our people—young people, in particular—to have jobs, because there's nothing more devastating to a human being than to have one life to live on this Earth and not be able to expend that life or use that life in a productive way to serve oneself, to serve one's family, to serve one's community, and, indeed, to serve one's nation. And to arrive at the age of 16 or 17 or 18 or 21 and not have a chance for gainful employment is a devastating blow to a young person—man or woman."", ""We've not solved all those problems. In the last 3 1/2 years, we have added a net increase of 1 million jobs in our country for black people alone. The unemployment rate among young black people has gone down 14 percent. We have doubled the programs in the Job Corps, the CETA programs. And now we're asking the Congress for the only major new domestic program of the year, an additional $2 billion to be spent to take those young people that might be ready to drop out of high school and give them extra training, either on the job or in the high school with a job, and let that be a permanent part of American life. We've not yet got it through the Congress. We're fighting for it, and with your help we will get it. This is important that we do it."", ""The Federal Government jobs have gone down since I've been in office, the total. But jobs for black people employed in the Federal Government have increased 20,000, and we now have 15 percent of the total employment in the Federal Government; black employees. We haven't yet reached the promised land. We need to do more, but we're making progress down the right road."", ""And we want our people to have food. I want to be sure that no one in this country goes hungry. We have had an adequate food stamp program evolved, but as you know, a few years ago, the last time I was in this church, you had to have money to buy the food stamps to go back and get food. We've eliminated that requirement. Now you get the food stamps. And this is a major step forward, but the Congress is still treading on dangerous ground in not fully funding the food stamp program. We almost lost it the 15th day of May. But with your help and many like you, including Otis Moss, George Forbes, Vernon Jordan, others, we're making progress to make sure that people don't suffer from a lack of food."", ""Housing also is needed for our families. We've increased allocation of funds for housing by 75 percent. Government-assisted housing in next year's budget will jump from 240,000 to 300,000; we're going back now to get a hundred more thousand homes. Making progress; we haven't yet reached the promised land—God knows we have not—but we're making progress down the road toward the goals that we all share."", ""We already have programs that will let any young person of college age in this country get a college education without regard to their family financial condition if they're qualified to do the academic work. A major step forward; a long way yet to go but we're making progress."", ""I could go on and on; I don't want to make my talk too long but I would like to say this. Those programs are good. They are needed. They're long overdue. But we've got to be sure that we have justice in other ways. The decisions are made not by a President, not by a Congress, not even by a member of the city council; but over a long period of time the decisions are made by the regulatory agencies and by the Federal courts."", ""I wanted to bring people that knew what deprivation was into the Government with me, and Otis has mentioned some of those people: Pat Harris and Drew Days. You've also got Eleanor Holmes Norton, and you know we've had Andy Young. And we've got the Secretary of the Army, who understands what it means to be deprived of an equal opportunity to serve in the Armed Forces of our country. But we also need more and more people to serve permanently for life."", ""We've had some good Presidents in the past—Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, John Kennedy, and others. I've only been in office now 3 1/2 years, but I have been able to appoint more black Federal judges than all the previous Presidents put together since our Nation was founded. Next week we're going to have another one, George White. George, stand up a minute."", ""I'd like to say one other thing. This is a time of controversy; this is a time of challenge; this is a time of impatience; this is a time of inconvenience. But it's also a time of opportunity. It's a time to build on what we've already done. It's a time to look to the future with hope and with conviction that if we all pull together we'll continue to make progress."", ""I was in the Navy for 11 years, and if you put people that want to go in the same direction in a boat, and half of them are rowing forward and half of them are rowing backwards, the boat's not going very far. As a matter of fact, it could do worse than stand still. A President has got to face a lot of things: rampaging rivers, exploding volcanoes, Republicanism that might come back next November. And we don't want our boat to sink the first week in November, right? So, let's pull together."", ""Ours is a great country. We're all in it together. We never thought it would take this long to reach the promised land. When the civil rights bills were passed more than 15 years ago we thought the time would be short when full equality would be with us and when full equality of opportunity would be the lot of our families. We've not yet quite reached that goal. But we are moving in the right direction. It's going to take persistence, harmony, trust, conviction, and prayer."", 'James said ""the effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much,"" right?

And I look forward to meeting the Republican nominee—I presume it will be Governor Reagan—both on the campaign trail and in intense, head-on-head debates to let the American people choose whom they want."", ""It's time to set the record straight. It's time to present clearly to the American people what our Nation is, what it has been; the formidable challenges and problems which we face; the fact that there are no easy answers and there are no easy solutions; that we must be bound together in a spirit of partnership and mutual commitment to realize the tremendous potential of our country in the future."", ""We need not fear those questions or those problems or those obstacles. In times of trial and testing, our Nation has never failed. It's good in a democratic system to have the American people participate, and 15 million Democrats have participated so far in this primary season. Now it's time for the American people to clearly define the issues and to make a choice for the future."", 'As for myself, I have no doubt that our Nation will triumph and win a tremendous victory over the problems that face us now, because of our innate strength. And I have no doubt that together, you and I, and all other Democrats, will triumph in November and return a Democrat next year to the White House again, and I hope that Fritz Mondale will be my running mate there.', ""Again, in the general election campaign I need your support, your friendship, and your dedicated work, as you've already demonstrated you're eager to give. And I close my remarks the same way I began them: Thank you from the bottom of my heart. God bless every one of you. Thank you.""]"

How many of you believe we're going to whip the Republicans in November? [Applause] Right on. Absolutely. And the reason for that is that the Democratic Party—what we have done, what we are doing, what we will do—is compatible with the finest ideals of the American Nation of which we are so proud."", 'The Democratic Party believes that our Nation ought to stay at peace through strength. Our Nation will stay strong. I know how Texans feel and what you believe in and what your commitments are. and I know the depth of your patriotism and the height of your aspirations for our country.', ""Ours is a nation that has always believed in a strong defense, and for 8 years, before I was elected President with your help, we saw a steady downward trend in our Nation's commitment to defense. Our Nation must be strong in its ability to preserve freedom, because that is the best way for us to stay at peace—for all those who believe in us, our allies and our own people, and all those who might want to challenge us to know that any challenge would be doomed to failure, because America is so unified and so strong. And that's the way the Democrats are going to keep this country."", ""I might point out that we have dealt with some very difficult issues. We've not only been satisfied with peace for ourselves; we've tried to strengthen NATO, we've tried to bring in the Middle East two nations and their people, who have hated each other for more than 30 years, to sit down in a spirit of friendship and cooperation around the bargaining table and work out their apparently insurmountable differences between them."", ""We've opened up new friendships with more than a fourth of the total population on Earth—the People's Republic of China. At the same time, we have kept our trade going and building and our friendships firm with the people of Taiwan. We've had good relationships to the north with Canada and to the south with Mexico. We've treated the Latin American countries as our equals, because they are."", ""And we've respected the rights of all people throughout the world. Our commitment to human rights will never change, and that's what we believe in."", ""And I would like to point out to you that with the exception of eight brave Americans who gave their lives in an accident in the desert of Iran, we have not had a single American life lost in combat since I've been President, and I pray God we'll keep it that way."", ""Let me point out, too, that my ancestors and your ancestors have always been willing to invest themselves in peace. Today is the first day of registration for our young men, to make sure that in the future, if we are challenged, we will be able to defend ourselves. We do not anticipate departing from a full-volunteer military force. We are registering today just in case we are challenged in the future. But that's the best way to make sure that we will be strong."", ""Our Nation is not only strong militarily; we are strong economically. As a matter of fact, all of you know that our country is the strongest nation militarily, economically, politically, and I believe, morally and ethically as well. We believe in and fight for our principles, and they'll never change."", ""As you know, we had an OPEC oil embargo against us beginning in 1973, and all the way through until 1977, the previous Republican administration did absolutely nothing to protect our Nation from its overly dependent posture and vulnerability about a 12,000-mile uncertain pipeline from one of the most troubled areas of the world. Under the leadership of men like Martin Frost, Jim Mattox, Lloyd Bentsen, the Congress has now put into effect a sound energy policy for our country. And already, in just a short 3 years, we have reduced the amount of foreign oil that we import every day by 1 1/2 million barrels. We're making progress. We're going to continue, with the help of Texas."", ""I think the American people—even including the Communist Workers Party, who is shouting back here in the audience-recognize that our Nation is one that believes in human beings. We make our major investment in people, because we are a party not only of competence and commitment but we are also a party of compassion. We believe that when God makes a human being and gives that person a certain amount of talent aud ability, that that talent and ability ought to be nourished and improved and each citizen of this great country ought to have a chance to stand on one's own feet, to make one's own judgments, and to bear part of the responsibilities of full citizenship. We don't believe in permanent dependence on the Federal Government. We believe in helping people, with a hand, to stand on their own feet."", ""And the last thing I would like to say to you is this: The Democratic Party, in the finest sense of the word, believes in people. We don't forget who put us in office, and we don't forget who can take us out of office if we don't measure up to your expectations. As you all remember, 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago, our Nation was embarrassed by divisive war; we were embarrassed in the Oval Office itself by Watergate. The people felt that they could not trust public officials. The truth was not always told to you even by the highest officials in our own Government. That time has changed."", ""I don't claim to you that the Democratic Party is perfect; I don't claim to you even that the United States of America is perfect. But we always strive to face issues without fear. We are not afraid of open debate. We are not afraid to let differences be aired. We are not afraid to analyze our own thoughts and our own failures and our own troubles, and we are never afraid to strive to overcome those obstacles and overcome those difficulties and answer those tough questions, together as a united people. As a matter of fact, at this time, even though we do face problems with unemployment and inflation and sometimes energy shortages, compared to previous people, generations before us, even compared to some previous years in our own lives, we are blessed far beyond any other people on Earth."", ""I've been to Berlin, and I've seen the Berlin Wall. On one side are Communists in East Berlin. The wall was not built to keep people from going into East Germany; the wall was built by the East Germans as a prison for their own people, because they want to escape from communism and come to the United States."", ""And there's also a Communist government not very far from our own shores in Cuba. You don't see a bunch of boats lined up in the United States for people trying to escape to Cuba, right? And there's a Communist government in Southeast Asia, the Vietnamese, occupying Kampuchea—hundreds of thousands of people trying to escape from communism to freedom."", ""And the same applies in Afghanistan, where the Soviet Union has invaded a small, relatively defenseless, deeply religious country that was no challenge to anyone. Nine hundred thousand freedom loving people have escaped Afghanistan into Pakistan and Iran. They're escaping from communism to freedom, not from freedom to communism."", ""So, in spite of the fact that we are not a perfect nation, we've got a lot to be thankful for. And as we read in the newspapers and watch the television and listen to the radio, we hear about the arguments and the debates; we hear about the temporary inconveniences; we hear about the disappointments; we hear about the questions that haven't yet been answered; we hear about the problems that we've not yet solved; and we hear about the obstacles that we've not yet overcome. But our Nation has never failed to answer a question, to solve a problem, or to overcome an obstacle when our American people were united and when we saw the obstacle clearly and the goals we wanted to reach."", ""We live in the greatest nation on Earth. And with your help and all those who believe in the principles of our Nation and our Democratic Party, we're going to be an even greater nation in the future with a tremendous victory in November."", 'Thank you very much.

No easy answers are found there, because no easy questions come there."", ""I've learned that for a President, experience is the best guide to the right decisions. I'm wiser tonight than I was 4 years ago."", ""And I have learned that the Presidency is a place of compassion. My own heart is burdened for the troubled Americans.

He must protect our children and the children they will have and the children of generations to follow. He must speak and act for them. That is his burden and his glory."", ""And that is why a President cannot yield to the shortsighted demands, no matter how rich or powerful the special interests might be that make those demands. And that's why the President cannot bend to the passions of the moment, however popular they might be. That's why the President must sometimes ask for sacrifice when his listeners would rather hear the promise of comfort."", ""The President is a servant of today, but his true constituency is the future. That's why the election of 1980 is so important."", ""Some have said it makes no difference who wins this election. They are wrong. This election is a stark choice between two men, two parties, two sharply different pictures of what America is and what the world is, but it's more than that—it's a choice between two futures."", 'The year 2000 is just less than 20 years away, just four Presidential elections after this one. Children born this year will come of age in the 21st century. The time to shape the world of the year 2000 is now. The decisions of the next few years will set our course, perhaps an irreversible course, and the most important of all choices will be made by the American people at the polls less than 3 months from tonight.', 'The choice could not be more clear nor the consequences more crucial. In one of the futures we can choose, the future that you and I have been building together, I see security and justice and peace.', 'I see a future of economic security-security that will come from tapping our own great resources of oil and gas, coal and sunlight, and from building the tools and technology and factories for a revitalized economy based on jobs and stable prices for everyone.', 'I see a future of justice—the justice of good jobs, decent health care, quality education, a full opportunity for all people regardless of color or language or religion; the simple human justice of equal rights for all men and for all women, guaranteed equal rights at last under the Constitution of the United States of America.', 'And I see a future of peace—a peace born of wisdom and based on a fairness toward all countries of the world, a peace guaranteed both by American military strength and by American moral strength as well.', ""That is the future I want for all people, a future of confidence and hope and a good life. It's the future America must choose, and with your help and with your commitment, it is the future America will choose."", 'But there is another possible future.

And I see surrender—the surrender of our energy future to the merchants of oil, the surrender of our economic future to a bizarre program of massive tax cuts for the rich, service cuts for the poor, and massive inflation for everyone. And I see risk—the risk of international confrontation, the risk of an uncontrollable, unaffordable, and unwinnable nuclear arms race.', ""No one, Democrat or Republican either, consciously seeks such a future, and I do not claim that my opponent does. But I do question the disturbing commitments and policies already made by him and by those with him who have now captured control of the Republican Party.

It's up to all of us to make sure America rejects this alarming and even perilous destiny."", 'The only way to build a better future is to start with the realities of the present.

Women, like children, are to be seen but not heard. The problems of working women are simply ignored. The elderly do not need Medicare. The young do not need more help in getting a better education. Workers do not require the guarantee of a healthy and a safe place to work. In their fantasy world, all the complex global changes of the world since World War II have never happened. In their fantasy America, all problems have simple solutions—simple and wrong.', ""It's a make-believe world, a world of good guys and bad guys, where some politicians shoot first and ask questions later. No hard choices, no sacrifice, no tough decisions—it sounds too good to be true, and it is."", ""The path of fantasy leads to irresponsibility. The path of reality leads to hope and peace. The two paths could not be more different, nor could the futures to which they lead. Let's take a hard look at the consequences of our choice."", 'You and I have been working toward a more secure future by rebuilding our military strength—steadily, carefully, and responsibly. The Republicans talk about military strength, but they were in office for 8 out of the last 11 years, and in the face of a growing Soviet threat they steadily cut real defense spending by more than a third.', ""We've reversed the Republican decline in defense. Every year since I've been President we've had real increases in our commitment to a stronger Nation, increases which are prudent and rational. There is no doubt that the United States of America can meet a threat from the Soviet Union. Our modernized strategic forces, a revitalized NATO, the Trident submarine, the Cruise missile, the Rapid Deployment Force—all these guarantee that we will never be second to any nation. Deeds, not words; fact, not fiction. We must and we will continue to build our own defenses. We must and we will continue to seek balanced reductions in nuclear arms."", 'The new leaders of the Republican Party, in order to close the gap between their rhetoric and their record, have now promised to launch an all-out nuclear arms race. This would negate any further effort to negotiate a strategic arms limitation agreement. There can be no winners in such an arms race, and all the people of the Earth can be the losers.', 'The Republican nominee advocates abandoning arms control policies which have been important and supported by every Democratic President since Harry, Truman, and also by every Republican President since Dwight D. Eisenhower. This radical and irresponsible course would threaten our security and could put the whole world in peril. You and I must never let this come to pass.', ""It's simple to call for a new arms race, but when armed aggression threatens world peace, tough-sounding talk like that is not enough. A President must act responsibly."", 'When Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan, we moved quickly to take action. I suspended some grain sales to the Soviet Union; I called for draft registration; and I joined wholeheartedly with the Congress and with the U.S. Olympic Committee and led more than 60 other nations in boycotting the big propaganda show in Russia—the Moscow Olympics.', ""The Republican leader opposed two of these forceful but peaceful actions, and he waffled on the third. But when we asked him what he would do about aggression in Southwest Asia, he suggested blockading Cuba. [Laughter] Even his running mate wouldn't go along with that.

Before Camp David, Israel and Egypt were poised across barbed wire, confronting each other with guns and tanks and planes. But afterward, they talked face-to-face with each other across a peace table, and they also communicated through their own Ambassadors in Cairo and Tel Aviv."", ""Now that's the kind of future we're offering—of peace to the Middle East if the Democrats are reelected in the fall."", 'I am very proud that nearly half the aid that our country has ever given to Israel in the 32 years of her existence has come during my administration. Unlike our Republican predecessors, we have never stopped nor slowed that aid to Israel. And as long as I am President, we will never do so. Our commitment is clear: security and peace for Israel; peace for all the peoples of the Middle East.', 'But if the world is to have a future of freedom as well as peace, America must continue to defend human rights.', ""Now listen to this: The new Republican leaders oppose our human rights policy. They want to scrap it. They seem to think it's naive for America to stand up for freedom and democracy. Just what do they think we should stand up for?"", ""Ask the former political prisoners who now live in freedom if we should abandon our stand on human rights. Ask the dissidents in the Soviet Union about our commitment to human rights. Ask the Hungarian Americans, ask the Polish Americans, listen to Pope John Paul II.

Long after the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the Republicans in the White House had still done nothing to meet the threat to the national security of our Nation. Then, as now, their policy was dictated by the big oil companies.', ""We Democrats fought hard to rally our Nation behind a comprehensive energy policy and a good program, a new foundation for challenging and exciting progress.

Basically, their energy program has two parts. The first part is to get rid of almost everything that we've done for the American public in the last 3 years. They want to reduce or abolish the synthetic fuels program. They want to slash the solar energy incentives, the conservation programs, aid to mass transit, aid to elderly Americans to help pay their fuel bills. They want to eliminate the 55-mile speed limit. And while they are at it, the Republicans would like to gut the Clean Air Act. They never liked it to begin with."", 'That\'s one part of their program; the other part is worse. To replace what we have built, this is what they propose: to destroy the windfall profits tax and to ""unleash"" the oil companies and let them solve the energy problem for us. That\'s it. That is it. That\'s their whole program. There is no more. Can this Nation accept such an outrageous program?AUDIENCE. No !', ""THE PRESIDENT. No! We Democrats will fight it every step of the way, and we'll begin tomorrow morning with a campaign for reelection in November."", ""When I took office, I inherited a heavy load of serious economic problems besides energy, and we've met them all head-on. We've slashed Government regulations and put free enterprise back into the airlines, the trucking and the financial systems of our country, and we're now doing the same thing for the railroads. This is the greatest change in the relationship between Government and business since the New Deal. We've increased our exports dramatically. We've reversed the decline in the basic research and development, and we have created more than 8 million new jobs—the biggest increase in the history of our country."", ""But the road is bumpy, and last year's skyrocketing OPEC price increases have helped to trigger a worldwide inflation crisis. We took forceful action, and interest rates have now fallen, the dollar is stable and, although we still have a battle on our hands, we're struggling to bring inflation under control."", ""We are now at the critical point, a turning point in our economic history of our country. But because we made the hard decisions, because we have guided our Nation and its economy through a rough but essential period of transition, we've laid the groundwork for a new economic age."", ""Our economic renewal program for the 1980's will meet our immediate need for jobs and attack the very same, long-range problem that caused unemployment and inflation in the first place. It'll move America simultaneously towards our five great economic goals—lower inflation, better productivity, revitalization of American industry, energy security, and jobs."", ""It's time to put all America back to work—but not in make-work, in real work. And there is real work in modernizing American industries and creating new industries for America as well. Here are just a few things we'll rebuild together and build together:—new industries to turn our own coal and shale and farm products into fuel for our cars and trucks and to turn the light of the sun into heat and electricity for our homes;—a modern transportation system of railbeds and ports to make American coal into a powerful rival of OPEC oil;—industries that will provide the convenience of futuristic computer technology and communications to serve millions of American homes and offices and factories;—job training for workers displaced by economic changes;—new investment pinpointed in regions and communities where jobs are needed most;—better mass transit in our cities and in between cities;—and a whole new generation of American jobs to make homes and vehicles and buildings that will house us and move us in comfort with a lot less energy."", ""This is important, too: I have no doubt that the ingenuity, and dedication of the American people can make every single one of these things happen.

We're going to share in the exciting enterprise of making the 1980's a time of growth for America."", 'The Republican alternative is the biggest tax giveaway in history. They call it Reagan-Kemp-Roth; I call it a free lunch that Americans cannot afford. The Republican tax program offers rebates to the rich, deprivation for the poor, and fierce inflation for all of us.

If they are serious about these promises, and they say they are, then a close analysis shows that the entire rest of the Government would have to be abolished, everything from education to farm programs, from the G.I. bill to the night watchman at the Lincoln Memorial—and their budget would still be in the red. The only alternative would be to build more printing presses to print cheap money. Either way, the American people lose.

What's happened to their commitment to a safe and sane arms control?"", ""Now, I don't claim perfection for the Democratic Party. I don't claim that every decision that we have made has been right or popular; certainly, they've not all been easy. But I will say this: We've been tested under fire. We've neither ducked nor hidden, and we've tackled the great central issues of our time, the historic challenges of peace and energy, which have been ignored for years. We've made tough decisions, and we've taken the heat for them. We've made mistakes, and we've learned from them. But we have built the foundation now for a better future."", ""We've done something else, perhaps even more important.

And there have been a few times when White House binoculars were trained on that window as well. [Laughter]"", ""We share a lot of concerns, and we share a lot of hopes, and we share a lot of dreams. The progress that our Nation has made has been, to a large degree, predicated on the good relationship between the men and women who work in this Nation and those leaders like you who represent them and an enlightened Democratic leadership in the White House who is just as visionary, just as dedicated, to service as anyone in the labor movement. It's a good partnership. It's a partnership that ought to be preserved. It's a partnership that I'm eager to honor and your confidence I'm determined to prevail."", ""I'm proud to be the first President to address your annual convention. The other Presidents don't know what they've missed. I hope you'll let me come back to your convention, but I hope for the next 4 or 5 years no other different person will come as President."", ""As proud as I am of that honor, I'm even prouder to have your endorsement as candidate for President, and I'll do the best I can not to betray your trust and not to disappoint you during the campaign this fall—which I intend to be successful-nor in the administration that's going to follow that for the next 4 years. And I'm also grateful and pleased to have the support of the AFL-CIO executive council. Together we're going to make this election a victory, not just for myself and Fritz Mondale but for all teachers and students and for all the working men and women of our country. That's my commitment, and I'm not going to betray you."", ""I might say that, speaking of teachers and students, I learned a lesson this year about the value of an AFT endorsement. It's inscribed very clearly on my mind the classrooms where I was taught, places like New York and Rhode Island and Pennsylvania. [Laughter] I really learned it pays to have the AFT with you, and I'm so glad that we are once again, as we were in 1976, on the same side politically. And I'd like to say something now about a mutual friend who was part of this year's education process: a great man, Senator Ted Kennedy."", ""Yesterday morning, just before he left Boston to come and be with you, he welcomed me to his home city. It was a warm, genuine, deeply appreciated welcome, and it reminded us both of last October when he and I were together, also in Boston, at the dedication of the John F. Kennedy Library. It was a day full of memory and a day full of promise. I made a speech on that day that was challenging to write but an honor to deliver, and I said then that despite all the changes that have taken place since the early 1960's the spirit of dedication and the spirit of idealism that marked John Kennedy's life is even more urgent today than perhaps it was then."", ""Ted Kennedy personifies to me that spirit, and I'm glad to be working with him and also with all the others that he inspired to join him and now to join me in a common cause."", ""I don't want to overlook an opportunity to say that I'm also very pleased and it's good for me to have on my ticket a man who shares this spirit in full measure and throughout his entire life of dedication to human concerns and dedication to better education in our Nation—and that's Fritz Mondale. I doubt very seriously that in the last 200 years there has been a closer partnership, both personal and political, than exists between me and my Vice President. Our country couldn't have a finer man."", ""And I would also like to say a word about one other person, another dedicated American, because this is a time when, as was just mentioned, human beings around the world in a highly publicized way are reaching out for freedom—we see this in the world headlines today—and also reaching out for the true principles of trade unionism. The combination is free trade unionism, and I'm glad to stand together, once again, with a man who has dedicated his life to these principles, your president and my friend, Al Shanker."", 'Almost every time there\'s a quiet, confidential discussion about the AFT, you\'re always characterized as a fighting union, a union of classroom teachers. And I have a special feeling for those who fight for principle and those who represent the finest element of education in our country. This feeling comes from my lifelong concern with education, but it\'s also because of a special nature of responsibilities which you and I share. Harry Truman\'s old motto ""The buck stops here"" applies just as much to teachers as it does to Presidents. In any system of education, the teacher\'s the one who finally does the difficult job, or else the job just doesn\'t get done.', 'As you well know, teachers and Presidents have to take a lot of heat- [laughter] —for problems in our society that we don\'t originate. I can\'t think of a better story than one of my favorites, which I\'m sure you may have heard, about the man that was brought before the judge. The judge said, ""You\'ve been accused of getting drunk and setting the bed on fire."" And the man says, ""Judge, I plead guilty to getting drunk but the bed was on fire when I got in it."" [Laughter] This is exactly the situation when a new President walks into the Oval Office or when a new teacher walks into a classroom. But I don\'t know of a better place to put the responsibility for difficult changes that must take place in any society, and particularly in a democracy, where we\'re on the cutting edge of change and progress.', ""Both of us have a day-in-day-out, fulltime responsibility to do all we can to alleviate the human costs of society's problems, and in our jobs we know that there are no shortcuts, there are no substitutes for hard and dedicated work. But the deepest bond between us, in your work as teachers and in my work as President, is that we are both concerned above all with the future. The people you teach not only represent the future, they are the future, and the seeds of knowledge and understanding, of independent thought that you plant often bear their sweetest fruit many years after you finish your job with that person."", 'As President, I too have a responsibility for the future, knowing that the hard decisions that I make today—and there are no easy ones—will shape the kind of world that we pass on to future generations. So, as we meet today, not just as a candidate and voters and leaders, but as comrades in arms for a better, more humane, and more decent future, the election of 1980 will determine whether your struggle and mine is successful.', ""Seldom in electoral history has the choice been so clear. The only possible other election in my lifetime when the choice was so clear was in 1964 between Barry Goldwater and Lyndon Johnson. Seldom has the views and the commitments of the candidates been so profoundly different. The American people will be choosing not just between two men, not even just between two political parties, but between two paths that lead to two quite different futures for ourselves, our families, and for all those about whom we're concerned."", ""I'm convinced that the American people will choose wisely, because I respect the character and intelligence of our people. And when the general election time comes and individual Americans go in that voting booth to think about the future of their family and their children and their Nation, with allies like you, 1 believe that we can and will be successful, because we believe as Americans that united, in spite of difficulties that we face and acknowledge, that we can shape the future as we want it to be."", ""Other nations, other people, are fearful about years to come, and they are fearful about changes that they don't quite understand. But Americans have shared some of that concern, but, in effect, we have thrived on it, because Americans are committed to individual human beings who are free and to a free enterprise system that encourages innovation, that can accommodate change, where we're not frozen because we are fearful to speak and where open debate quite often leads to the best decision. We're not afraid of differences among us, and we don't try to discipline the human minds to the extent that it's not constantly probing for even difficult and unpleasant truths."", ""An election year is a good time in a democracy for sober assessment of our past achievements and our past failures, for our challenges, and also for our opportunities. I look forward this year to several debates with the Republican nominee in different parts of the country. And I'm also willing to debate other candidates, any candidate who might even have a theoretical chance to be elected President."", ""I'm eager to let the issues be made clear and to let the people decide. The thing I want most of all though is a clear, two-man debate between myself and Ronald Reagan. That is where the people can decide most clearly how these two paths to the future might affect the lives of all of us."", 'The truth and the facts are important. There\'s no place in American life for a ""pie in the sky,"" but there\'s a new math that\'s being propounded in different proposals. One of them is that in this election year there are claims being made that there can be some massive tax cuts for the rich equivalent to a trillion dollars in the years ahead; that we can at the same time have a massive increase in defense commitments, including the reinstitution of a nuclear arms race; that we can balance the budget at the same time and still provide social services, adequate education, and other needs of the American people. This is obviously a fallacy, and the American people are too intelligent to fall for it. But the facts must be presented in order for the American people to understand the fallacious nature of this kind of proposal.', ""Our country has gone through difficult times, which I need not enumerate here now. But we've also gone through some successful times quite recently. One is a national process of education on one of the most important domestic and international issues of our lifetime, and that is energy."", ""We now know, as Americans, something we didn't know even 12 months ago, or many would not acknowledge, and that is that we must cut down our dependence on foreign oil. It's crucial to our Nation's security. It's also crucial to the security of our country, and it also removes the chance of blackmail that might be imposed on us and other nations of the world if that excessive dependence is continued."", ""The American people have acted. There's been a dramatic cut in the amount of oil we import already. Today, we imported 1 1/2 million barrels less, in 1 day, than we did a year ago. And that same record has been continued ever since the beginning of 1980. We've not succeeded completely yet in this effort, but we've laid a good foundation, and now we're ready to build on it. This gives us a new and exciting way to change American life for the better, not with a decrease in our quality of life, but an increase in the quality of our life."", ""Within the next week, I intend to outline to the Nation a practical and aggressive new strategy for renewing our economic and our industrial base, part of it predicated upon the inevitable changes brought about by energy independence and a commitment that our Nation's made. This will create literally hundreds of thousands of new jobs and can be accomplished at the same time with even more stable prices for all. This will not be an easy task, but I'm determined to succeed. And along with energy, our rededication to American education is crucial to that strategy and to the future."", ""Before I became President, the Federal commitment to education was constantly declining in real terms. Together we've reversed that trend. During a time of necessary budget restraint in order to meet the challenge of international inflationary pressures invoked on us by OPEC, we've increased spending for education more than 73 percent in just a little over 3 years."", ""It's important to me to protect public education. We've fought together successfully against a proposal that would undermine public education, and that is tuition tax credits, and we're going to continue that fight. Universal, free, quality education for all Americans is part of the greatness of our future as well as our past, and we do not want it endangered, and if you'll stick with me, we will not permit it to be endangered. And we're also seeking better working conditions for teachers, because we know that the education of our children depends on the morale and the commitment of classroom teachers."", ""Along with you and your executive committee and your president, I'm concerned about the fundamental role of collective bargaining. We need to remove difficult, discouraging, unrewarding circumstances that teachers have to face. I've authorized an interagency study to report to me on how teachers' salaries and working conditions affect the quality of education. I'll honor the prerogatives and the authority of local and State officials, but I want all of us to understand what government at every level can do to offer constructive alternatives to work stoppages by meeting the real needs of the teachers of this country."", ""In the humane future that we all want, there must be a self-fulfilling and a gratifying place for young Americans. A mind is a terrible thing to waste—we've all heard this compelling appeal by the United Negro College Fund. We've all seen the television portrayal of a young man sitting alone, listening helplessly to the sounds of the city outside, a world in which he cannot hope to compete and within which he cannot hope to take the talent or ability given to him, given by God, and use that talent or ability productively."", ""So far in my administration, we've increased funding for youth employment and for training almost 100 percent, but we've not yet done enough and we're determined to do more without further delay. That's why, with your help, with the active participation of Al and many of you, we've developed the most farreaching youth measure ever proposed to the Congress. We call it the youth bill."", ""It bolsters basic education and job training, and it offers the kind of parttime work that's linked to the learning which is going on in the classroom. It encourages those who would otherwise drop out of school to stay there, and it ties much more closely to educational process with a chance for a successful career after the classroom work is completed. The measure will add $2 billion in more muscle into our existing $4 billion commitment to youth programs. That's a lot of money, but it's the kind of money that we cannot afford not to spend."", ""Investing in education, investing in youth is one of the essential ways that we can provide for a better future. That's why I wanted to elevate education to a top level of government, and that's why we are fighting to improve education programs from Title I, to education for the handicapped, to teacher centers, where teachers themselves can help to shape programs that will give us a better approach to education. That's why we'll continue to cut redtape and paperwork and let teachers get on with the job of teaching for a change. It's important to me that the AFT and your leaders play an integral role with me as President, with Secretary Shirley Hufstedler, and with others, including of course the Congress, as you've done so well, as we make these kinds of decisions. I won't try to enumerate all the things that are going on in the Congress and in the administration and in your own lives concerning education."", ""I speak about these concerns not only as President but also as a parent. My sons were all educated in the public schools and also in the public colleges. And my daughter, Amy, is now beginning her fourth year in the Washington, D.C., public schools, where I've been able to see firsthand the skill and the dedication of members of Local Number Six. [Laughter] I might add that Amy's looking forward to more years of— [laughter] —quality education in Washington, D.C., at least 4 more years to be exact."", ""And while I'm on the subject, I want Amy to have something else. When she grows up I want Amy to have the same rights that her brothers have now, and I want those rights as a woman guaranteed where they belong, in the Constitution of the United States of America."", ""In the great national debate over the future direction of our country, there is no doubt where you and I stand. We stand for civil rights, strictly enforced. We stand for vigorous protection of the lives and safety of every worker, guaranteed by the Government. We stand for reform of the labor laws, and we're going to fight for it again next year and win. And we stand for human things like pure air and pure water that you can drink. We stand for revitalizing our cities, which is very important to me, and we will not abandon our cities. And we stand for a strong America, and we stand for world peace."", ""For the last 3 1/2 years our Nation has been at peace. We've secured that peace by enhancing our strength, both our military strength and our moral strength. It's been a long time, more than 50 years, since a President has served a complete term or terms in the White House without having combat troops lose their lives in war."", ""We've pursued peace not only for ourselves but for others. In the Middle East Israel no longer confronts her most powerful Arab neighbor across barbed wire. Instead, they talk together; with difficulty, yes; sometimes with delays that are very frustrating to me and to Prime Minister Begin and to President Sadat. But they talk and they exchange ideas not only across the peace table but through Ambassadors of their own nations in the other nation—in Tel Aviv and in Cairo—about the right road to permanent peace."", 'Three years ago, who would have dreamed that such a thing would be possible? Who would have dreamed that planes would be flying between Jerusalem or Tel Aviv and Cairo and Alexandria, that tourists would cross the border to make friends on the other side, that full diplomatic relations would exist, and that we could have a prospect of perpetual peace there? My total personal effort, in spite of every obstacle, this year and in the future, will be devoted to the realization of the commitments made in the Camp David accords so clearly and so solemnly by all three of our nations: a peaceful and secure Israel, peace and justice for all people in the Middle East. When the history books are written about my administration, that is my fondest hope, that that will be included.', ""To meet the Soviet challenge we've strengthened our defense capabilities while at the same time we have sought mutual limits on nuclear arms. A peaceful future includes both strength and control of nuclear arms. We must prevent nuclear war."", 'We\'ve heard the word ""noble"" used. We must recognize the nobility of an honorable peace, and I\'m very proud that our country is again the champion of human rights around the world. We take that stand, because we are Americans and the love of liberty is the very soul of our people and of our Republic. And as long as I\'m President, no matter what the temptations might be to the contrary for temporary diplomatic advantage, you can be sure that our Nation, your Nation, will go on struggling for human rights.', ""Let me say in closing that the work you do as teachers is very much a part of all these commitments, and many that I haven't taken the time to enumerate. What you do is important, not just because it adds to the skills of our labor force or the size of our gross national product, but because it strengthens democracy and freedom itself. We often place too heavy a load on the schools and on the men and women who teach in them, but the fact remains that your classrooms are the place where society is able to speak to itself, where young Americans take new strength from the American past and from the whole common experience of humanity. You help America develop the intellectual and the moral tools to master the future."", 'Building the future is the essence of your life and mine. It\'s also the essence of America. In his memorable novel ""You Can\'t Go Home Again"" Thomas Wolfe wrote these stirring words, and I quote from his book: ""I think the true discovery of America is before us. I think the true fulfillment of our spirit, of our people, of our mighty and immortal land is yet to come. I think the true discovery of our democracy is still before us. I think that all these things are as certain as the morning, as inevitable as noon. Our America is here, is now, and beckons us, and this glorious assurance is not only our living hope but our dream to be accomplished."" A beautiful quote.', ""In the year 1980 America still beckons us toward that same hope and that same dream, but it's not going to come automatically nor easily. We must fight for it, and I'm glad we're fighting for it together side by side, and together you and I will be victorious."", 'Thank you very much.']"

The land typifies the values which are dear to us—hard work, self-reliance, trust in our families, trust in our neighbors, and trust in our God.

They said we ought to be afraid of each other, that whites ought to hate and be afraid of blacks and that blacks ought to hate and be afraid of whites. And they would persecute those who worshiped in a different way from most of us. As a Southerner, it makes me feel angry when I see them with a Confederate battle flag because I remember Judah P. Benjamin who was Secretary of State of the Confederacy; he was a Jew. And I remember General Pat Cleburne of Arkansas who died in battle not very far from this very spot, and General Beauregard of Louisiana, brave men. Both were Catholics, and so were many others who served under that flag.

After several days of hard negotiating, it got so that Prime Minister Begin and President Sadat were not even talking to one another. There was a deadlock. We weren\'t getting anywhere. So, I said to the two men, ""Let\'s take a day off,"" and I took them across the border, the Maryland-Pennsylvania border, to Gettysburg. I had been there a little before with a southern historian, Shelby Foote, so I knew pretty well what to expect when we arrived. I wanted to show these two men that we Americans know something about war, and we know about neighbors fighting against neighbors.', ""The three of us walked through the valleys and hills where more than 40,000 young Americans fell in battle—Cemetery Hill, Seminary Ridge, Little Round Top, Devil's Den. I thought then of the 14th Volunteer Regiment from Clarksville, Tennessee, as they marched toward Gettysburg the second day of July of 1863. There were 400 men in the 14th Tennessee Regiment. As the sun rose 2 days later, on July the 4th, 1863, of the 400 men there were left only 60. And when the Sun set on that terrible day, there were only three men left."", 'As we looked across the fields, standing on the same place where General Robert E. Lee stood, I thought of General MacArthur\'s farewell address to the cadets at West Point. General MacArthur said, ""The soldier above all people prays for peace, [for] he must suffer and bear the deepest wounds . . . of war.""', ""I remembered that in all our Nation's wars, every war, young men from the South have led the rolls of volunteers and also led the rolls of casualties. We Southerners believe in the nobility of courage on the battlefield, and because we understand the cost of war, we also believe in the nobility of peace."", ""After that day at Gettysburg we went back to Camp David, and you know the rest. We hammered out a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel. We Americans work for peace not just to do a favor to others but because we want our own children and our own grandchildren to live in peace. That's why we must keep America strong, and that's why we must work for arms control, to stop and prevent a nuclear war that might mean the end of ourselves and all we love. And that's why we've opened full diplomatic relationships with the largest nation on Earth, China; and that's why we fought for democracy and for justice in Africa; and that's why we struggle to make our Nation energy independent, so that no nation might be tempted to risk the peace by trying to blackmail the United States of America."", ""In closing, let me say that as long as I'm President, we'll remain strong and America will continue to work for peace. We'll struggle for a strong and secure and a just society here at home, and as long as I'm President, America will hold high the banner of human rights."", ""There are those who say we ought not to do it. Some say it's naive for America to stand up for freedom and democracy in other lands. But they are wrong. But don't take my word for it. Ask those who are suffering under tyranny around the world about human rights. Ask them if America should stop fighting and speaking out for American principles, and ask the American people. We'll go on defending human rights for our own country and for people throughout the world."", ""And I'd like to mention briefly the situation in Poland. Celebrating our own labor holiday today, Americans look with pleasure and with admiration on the workers of Poland. We have been inspired and gratified by the peaceful determination with which they've acted under the most difficult possible circumstances. By their discipline, their tenacity, and their courage, the working men and women of Poland have set an example for all those who cherish freedom and human dignity. They have shown the world not just how to win a victory for labor, but that the hunger for human rights is everywhere. And they've accomplished this by themselves, without any interference from anywhere, and they and the Government of Poland have shown how a society which deals frankly with its problems can strengthen itself in the process. We are pleased at what has happened in Poland, and we wish them Godspeed and a future of prosperity, peace, and freedom."", ""For us in the last 200 years, even in the last 20 years, many things have changed, but our belief in America has remained the same. We still have our same dreams. We're determined that America shall redeem its destiny as the land of hope, of freedom, and of peace."", 'A great Southern author, Thomas Wolfe, once wrote these stirring words: ""The true discovery of America is before us. The true fulfillment of our spirit, of our people, of our mighty and immortal land, is yet to come. Our America is here, is now, and it beckons us, and this glorious assurance is not only our living hope but our dream to be accomplished.""', ""In the year 1980, America still beckons us toward that hope and that dream, but it will not be easy. We have never had nor expected anything of value to be easy. We must fight for it, and as we choose the path this year to America's future, I ask for your help and support. If we fight [for] our future side-by-side, then together we will be victorious, our Nation will be strong, united, and free, and we will have a better life for all Americans."", ""God bless you. Stick with me, and we'll win.""]"
31,Jimmy Carter ,"September 03, 1980","['Thank you very much, Congressman Bill Gray. I\'m very proud to have you as an assistant pastor today. [Laughter] I noticed Leon Sullivan said ""copastor,"" but I\'m sure he meant ""assistant."" [Laughter] It\'s an honor for me to stand here in this pulpit in a church that\'s literally known around the world—a church with a heart, a church which has reached its hand to help others, to many nations on Earth, a church which gives its support to Leon Sullivan and to his fine work.', ""I'm also very glad to have with us today Mayor Bill Green, State Auditor Al Benedict— [applause] —go ahead and applaud for him—Representative Leroy Ervis and particularly Grace Sullivan, and many other distinguished leaders on the State and on the local basis, and distinguished clergy here. You mean so much to me in my private and religious life and who also mean so much to us in making our Nation a greater place to live—and particularly the members of the Zion Baptist Church."", ""It's great for me to be back home in Philadelphia. When I first got married, my wife and I came to Philadelphia to live for awhile. I was a young naval officer assigned to study radar at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and we learned here first that Philadelphia truly deserved its name of the City of Brotherly Love. We also learned some other firsts how to like scrapple and soft pretzels. And since then, of course, we've seen that Philadelphia has kept alive the finest elements of belief and hope and courage expressed here when our Nation was founded more than 200 years ago."", ""It is good to be in Zion Church. And I want to say to you that I first met your permanent pastor in Georgia when I was Governor. I hate to miss having Leon here with me today, but I learned a long time ago that it's dangerous to get in the same pulpit with a Baptist preacher when he's filled with the spirit. [Laughter] As you know, Leon Sullivan 1 always seems to be filled with the spirit. [Laughter]"", 'Reverend Sullivan said at a public event not too long ago that it was nice to have a President who knew all the words to ""Amazing Grace."" [Laughter] Well, I\'m not sure that everybody—that anybody knows all the words to ""Amazing Grace,"" because every now and then, kind of quietly, I compose a new verse just for myself. [Laughter] And I think that Leon probably composed the third verse. He says, as you know, ""Through many dangers, toils and shares [snares] I have already come .... "" [Laughter] You know what comes next: ""\'Tis Grace that brought me safe this far and Grace will lead me home."" [Laughter] So, I told Leon to just leave me and Grace here and to go on to South Africa and that we would take care of things while he was gone. [Laughter]', ""I know that his beloved wife shares in all his good works, but she also has her own work as well, programs that are helping not just individuals in this immediate community but that helps the entire city. Today as I was riding in from the airport, Mayor Bill Green and I were talking about the common effort that they have made on the Miniversity Program, that brings together policemen and community leaders to establish better avenues of understanding among people and better avenues of communications. That's where peace is maintained without inhibiting progress. That's where people can understand how to correct the defects in a community, to resolve problems before they become crises, and to pull people together in a common effort."", ""I'm very proud that your new mayor is reaching out to unite this great city. And he works with me in Washington, and he works with Congressmen like Bill Gray and Bob Edgar to try to bring this city into the forefront of progress and leadership. There's a strong partnership that I have with mayors throughout this country that we've forged in the last 3 1/2 years. I'm glad that in the brief months that Bill Green has been in the mayor's office that we've restored already Philadelphia's eligibility for housing and urban development grants, and already his leadership is bringing new jobs and new hope to this community. And I'm thankful for the support that you give him."", ""In Philadelphia, no President could come without being reminded that this Nation has not always lived up to the ideals expressed here when our Nation was founded 200 years ago or more. For generations—this congregation, this audience knows it better than most—for generations many people have seemed to be blind to injustice, blind to the lack of freedom, and blind to the denial of opportunity in our midst. As in the old hymn, we were blind but now we see. And having seen, we've begun to make good progress. But we still have a long way to go before we've realized all our hopes."", ""Sometimes we get so burdened down with our journey that we can't see or understand the past immediate dangers, toils, and snares. It's important to remember at those times how far we have come and to see how we are. on the right road in this Nation. It's important, because there are a lot of people out there who think we've come far enough. They want to turn back, but the American people are going to choose the path to progress when they go to the polls on November 4. And I believe that."", ""I need your help in this election, because I remember very clearly that we had a fine man running for President in 1968, Hubert Humphrey. He put his confidence in the people of this Nation. He put his confidence in the Democrats of this Nation. And the Nation let him down, and Richard Nixon was elected. It wasn't because people like you and me had anything against Hubert Humphrey; it's because Democrats throughout this Nation didn't know what the issues were at stake."", 'And the great strides that had been made in civil rights under Lyndon Johnson and under John Kennedy came to a screeching halt. And we heard code words like ""States\' rights"" again become the vocabulary of the administration in Washington. And we heard a so-called southern strategy that to me was an insult to the South. But it sent a message that slowed this Nation down in its progress, and it was a threat to all those who sought equal treatment and justice and opportunity. The poor of all races and particularly those who are poor and members of minority races, working people, city dwellers all suffered under the Republicans for 8 solid years. We cannot afford to let that happen again in 1980, and if you\'ll help me we won\'t. But I tell you it could happen.', ""We're now making progress on bringing our party and our Nation back together. A few minutes ago, about 2 minutes before I came into this auditorium, I had a call from out in the Midwest from Senator Ted Kennedy. He wanted to wish me well, and he wanted me to express his hope to you that the Democratic Party will be united in November and fervent in our work between now and then."", ""I don't remember any progress that this Nation has ever made that didn't require prayer, hard work, sometimes frustration, sometimes fear, and required a lot of courage. We absolutely must look to the future, not just to enhance basic legal rights and equality of opportunity of minority groups but to give our Nation a new economic base for a new day in America. We've made a lot of progress in the last 3 1/2 years. We've now laid a groundwork or a basis or a foundation for more progress. I've talked about this with Leon Sullivan at the annual convention. I talked to him about the 100,000 new jobs to which we are jointly committed for young people, 90 percent of which will be permanent jobs, in private industry, in private commerce."", ""The Zion Baptist Church has been doing what you can on a local basis, in your 1036 Club enterprises. That's not an easy thing either, to try to save $10 a month for 36 months. That's particularly difficult for a poor person, whose income is not very great. But you've recognized quite early that to save that much money and invest it in a common effort can create better life, more enjoyment, stronger families, better communities, more jobs for everyone, and that's what I want to do with my new economic program on a nationwide basis, just what you've done with the 1036 program here under the leadership of Grace and Leon Sullivan."", ""We want to help the basic industries like steel and the rapidly changing industries like the automobile manufacturers and assembly plants. We want to help communities who might suffer from change-and change cannot be prevented—and make sure that when a factory does close down because what they make is no longer to be sold, that new opportunities come along so people don't have to move from one community to another. This is the kind of careful planning that must be implemented during these next few years."", 'When there is Government aid to be given it needs to be focused or targeted where the aid is most important. And as we put all these programs together, to move to the future to provide jobs, to rebuild communities, to give people a better life, we do it all in such a way that we do not reignite inflation, because inflation robs the poor more than any other group in this country.', ""The program I outlined last week, in addition to all the programs that we've already got approved, in addition to normal recovery that's going to take place anyhow, in addition to all of the programs that are now before the Congress to be approved, the new ones will provide a million jobs in the next 2 years. This will be very important to us. We need to put our people to work doing jobs that need to be done—solving energy problems, rebuilding our railroads and bridges, making sure our ports can handle the tremendous exports to foreign countries, improving our mass transit systems and other transit systems. We cannot rely on the solutions of the past to solve today's problems. But that does not mean that we have to abandon vital programs that were so precious in the past and carved out with much difficulty in order to move forward in the future."", ""For instance, millions and millions of our people depend upon social security. It was a program put into effect by Democrats. It was opposed almost unanimously by the Republicans. Elderly people, disabled people who've worked all their lives depend upon social security. As you know, the Republican candidate had suggested that participation in social security not be required for all those who work anymore, but it be voluntary. That would destroy the social security system. Millions of Americans who've worked so hard to build up this program and who now depend on it and who've paid their share would suffer. Retired Americans have not volunteered for that kind of suffering, and if we make the right decision in November, which I'm sure we will, we won't ask them to suffer in the years ahead."", ""I wish I could stand here as a President, as a Baptist, and tell you we've reached the promised land— [laughter] -but I can't do it. I'd like to tell you that no child in America was coming out of school ill-prepared, but I can't do it yet. I'd like to tell you that no mothers and fathers would have to struggle to find a job or work in order to feed their families. I can't tell you that anymore [either].2 We're making progress. And that's what I can tell you."", ""Inflation has fallen sharply. Last month, for the first time in 13 years, the inflation rate was zero. I don't predict that's going to continue to happen, but it is a sign of progress. Last month the economic indicators showing how well our Nation was progressing—it was the highest it's ever been since the records were kept. I can't tell you that's going to continue, but it's a good sign. For the last 6 weeks, unemployment compensation claims have been going down. I can't promise you that they're going to keep on going down, but it's a good sign. Housing starts are going up. The number of laid-off workers in the automobile industry dropped last week. General Motors announced that almost 20,000 workers were already scheduled to go back to work. But we still face serious problems here at home and overseas as well."", ""But the point is we're moving down the right road, we know where we want to go, we're united now, and we can't change course, and we can't change leadership. In order to get where we want to go, I've been listening to some good advice. I hear from Leon Sullivan often."", ""And we've been making some good investments for the future: Federal funds for economic development—up 70 percent. For education—up 73 percent. Youth employment and training has tripled. We're putting more money in equal employment opportunity enforcement-Eleanor Holmes Norton, in charge of it—subsidized housing, child nutrition programs. In addition, we've got an urban policy that targets Federal aid where it's most needed. Every Federal decision now has to be made on the basis of how can we spend American taxpayers' money and get the most benefits back from it."", 'Let me give you just a couple of examples that apply to your own lives here in the Philadelphia area. Bob Edgar, Bill Gray, two fine Congressmen, working with your mayor, Bill Green, were able to announce last week that Philadelphia will not lose the Defense Contract Administration, but will gain jobs instead. The last time I was in Philadelphia that question came up.', ""And these men know how hard we had to work for me to make this next statement, which you already know about. The U.S.S. Saratoga will come to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard later this month for refitting. That will not only save between 8,500 and 9,000 jobs, but it'll bring in an additional 2,600 jobs, not handouts, not make-work jobs, but important jobs that will add 15 years of service to the life of this great ship, jobs that will build a stronger and a better and a more safe future for the country that we love. And I might add that the Forrestal, another great ship, will also be refitted here, and that's going to mean even more jobs than I said before."", ""In 1944 Franklin Roosevelt said he was not going to campaign, but he wanted to take the opportunity whenever it presented itself to set the record straight. And I intend to keep the record set straight. [Laughter] The record is that we have faced up to America's energy problems. We've cut our oil imports already by 20 percent below the day when I came in office. This day we bought from overseas 1 1/2 million less barrels of oil than we did in a day in January of 1977. We're embarking on the greatest peacetime program to produce more energy in our country and to save more energy in our country than this Nation has ever seen. It's bigger all put together than the Marshall plan that rebuilt Europe, plus the entire Interstate Highway System, plus the entire space program. That's how much it will mean to you. And to weatherize homes and to produce American energy and to have more efficient and better automobiles produced in America will give us a life whose quality we can't even yet understand."", ""We also have a record of which I'm proud in the area that means a lot to you, and that's the new jobs created. In the first 3 years I was President we added more than 8 million new jobs, about a million of which, coincidentally, are held by black Americans. Those are new jobs."", 'Just briefly let me say that I understand the importance of having minority leaders administer Government programs. And what I have tried to do is to take people who marched in the forefront of the civil rights movement, along with some of you, and let them run the programs that were put into effect in the Federal Government.', ""I've appointed more blacks and more women and other minorities to top Government jobs than any other President in history, and I've appointed more black judges to the Federal courts than all the other Presidents in history that ever served. And two other things: The first one is I'm not through yet, and secondly, I have never had to lower the standards of quality and ethics and training in order to fill those vacancies. One example is Judge Jim Giles here in Philadelphia. We'll be having the benefits of those kinds of appointments long after I have quit being President at the end of 4 more years and also even into the end of this century."", ""I don't want to belabor the point, but I'd like to name just a few people with whom you're familiar that have faced the dangers and the toils of trying to solve the problems of inequality and prejudice and the lack of opportunity—people like Pat Harris. Pat Harris now runs the Department of Health and Human Services. It's the biggest budget in the world except for two. One of them is the entire United States Government, and the other one is the entire Government of the Soviet Union. Her budget though in that Department that she runs is bigger than the budgets of every other nation on Earth."", ""Another one is a man who doesn't like to speak out very much, but when he speaks, people listen, and that's Andy Young. I've already mentioned Eleanor Holmes Norton, Don McHenry; people like Drew Days. I understand Drew Days has an uncle here, doesn't he, Senator Freeman Hankers? Senator Hankers, right. Drew Days is the chief law enforcement officer of our country. He's the one that decides when a case should be prosecuted, and it's important to me to have a man like this, who happens to be black, who knows the background of inequality in the administration of justice, is now in charge of the whole thing. And I've got Sadie Alexander, whose husband was a member of this church, to help me with the problems of the old people. And we've got a new Department of Education, and the Assistant Secretary of Education is a former deputy school superintendent of Philadelphia, Thomas Minter."", ""I don't want to go any further about naming the things that we've done in the past, but I'd like to close by saying just a few more things."", ""I've tried to be a President that would restore to America its rightful role as champion of human dignity and freedom, not just for our own Nation but for other countries as well. Not everything is right, and everything that's right can't be accomplished overnight. I had hoped for settlement in Rhodesia-Zimbabwe the first )'ear I was in office. Andy Young worked on this problem almost full time, trying to bring together the groups that had been fighting with each other for years and see final success. But we all had to learn a little patience, but we never yielded on our principles. I knew that only the people of that troubled land could reach a just settlement. We held out for what was right, and last week, new Prime Minister Mugabe, chosen in a free election by majority rule, came to visit me in the White House. It was an exciting thing. His presence there was testimony that America is most influential when we stand up for our highest principles. And the experience that we have had here, in America, is of great benefit to others who have been suffering in the past from deprivation and persecution and are now reaching for freedom. Leon Sullivan is now in South Africa. One of the things that he and I have discussed many times is the hope that the next nation that becomes a free democracy, with majority rule, will be the nation of Namibia. And we also want to see apartheid eliminated completely from South Africa."", ""We don't want to be too patient, but often our fondest dreams take longer than we imagined. We've already come through many dangers and toils and snares, too many to lose our faith that right will ultimately prevail. The next 4 years can be a time of great progress, a time when we at last let old prejudices go by the board, as we put our people, all our people, to work, building a better America, economically strong, but strong also in our faith in one another, strong in our commitment to freedom, our commitment to justice, our commitment to opportunity. I ask you for your help and your prayers, that together we might make this Nation the promised land for all our people, not just a few of them."", 'Thank you very much. God bless you.']"

For 18 years he's served this area and our Nation so well that I can't pass by an opportunity to say that on behalf of 240 million Americans we express our deep thanks to him for what he's meant and still will mean in the future to our great country."", ""And I also want to thank a bright and shining new star in the political firmament of our country, and that's Bill Bradley. He has a wonderful future. I know for a fact that he works more than 2 hours a day. [Laughter]"", ""As a matter of fact, it seems that the most popular job around New Jersey is not Bill Bradley's. I'd like to remind you that there are only 54 days left for the Presidential election campaign, and then you can devote yourself to the serious political task in New Jersey, and that's choosing a new Governor. [Laughter] I'm told that the next Governor of New Jersey might very well be in this room. But I was told that the room was not big enough to hold all the candidates so— [laughter] —Brendan Byrne said they've already decided, the Democratic chairman, Chairman Coffee back here, has said that there won't be room enough on the ballot for names, you'll just have to be given numbers as you qualify to run for Governor."", ""I'm very grateful that you would come here and meet me. I recognize that this audience, as Brendan Byrne has pointed out, comprises the leadership of New Jersey. And I have no doubt that when the election returns come in on November the 4th that the Democrats who are running for reelection to the Congress and Fritz Mondale and myself will have a tremendous victory racked up in your wonderful State."", ""I came here 2 or 3 years ago when Brendan Byrne didn't look too well in the public opinion polls. His election after that fairly dismal start for reelection has been an inspiration to me this year. I came here to help him, and my heart was in it. I look on Brendan Byrne as being a Governor in the same mold as Hughes, Woodrow Wilson, and others who have brought credit to this State and to the Nation—a man of great personal courage who has represented your State so well and also a man who's a personal friend of mine."", ""I'm not going to make a speech to you this morning—this afternoon now. I would like to say that I was able to visit one of the technological achievements of our country, located here in Perth Amboy. The Raritan River Steel Plant is indeed a credit to you, to the foresight of your leadership, and also a forerunner of what will be a tremendous achievement in our country as we revitalize American industry."", 'At the first of this century, as you know, we were in the leadership in the entire world—in modern technological advancement in the production of steel and also in our other basic industries. We have suffered since then in some ways. Of course, we still have the greatest nation on Earth.', 'The American worker, at this moment, is the most productive worker in the world. Our productivity per person has not been increasing as rapidly as some of the other nations on Earth, particularly those that were destroyed by us in the Second World War—like Japan and West Germany. But we now have reached a point in the evolutionary development of our country when we have a tremendous and exciting opportunity looking to the years ahead.', ""Three or four years ago there was a dismal feeling in this country that we could not possibly deal with the complexities of a rapidly growing crisis in energy. We were at the political mercy and the economic mercy of the OPEC oil-producing nations. And when I made a speech in April of 1977, saying that the energy crisis was the moral equivalent of war, a lot of the press and a lot of the people in this country discounted it as an idle threat designed for political purposes. It's proven to be true."", ""But in that 3-year period, the Congress has courageously addressed this issue that we've now prepared ourselves to save energy in this country—to stop wasting energy, to have strong conservation commitments individually and collectively, at the same time produce more energy for America. This will mean that we have an opportunity now to have a brighter, more exciting ability to capitalize on America's natural resources and our human resources.The OPEC nations, the Arab countries all put together, have about 6 percent of the world's total energy reserves—6 percent. The United States has 24 percent, and ours is not just oil and natural gas alone; ours is oil and natural gas, but it's also a broad range of energy reserve supplies that we've not yet even considered an adequate way to tap. This is why we now face the opportunity to rebuild the American industrial system, to care for communities where changes take place and lives are disrupted, to retrain human beings to go back on the job in new and exciting and innovative kinds of opportunities; at the same time to have deep research in technology and research and development, to revitalize our transportation system, to build our ports, to increase our exports."", ""At the steelplant, the Raritan River Steel Plant, I was told that 50 percent of the total production is going to the People's Republic of China. This is a nation of about a billion people. One-fourth of the human beings on Earth live in the People's Republic of China. Two years ago we had no diplomatic relationships and no trade relationships with China at all. We have, through good sound judgments made by myself and the Congress and supported by the American people, opened up this opportunity for a new relationship of great benefit to us all. That cannot be endangered. We have got to keep those ties of friendship and trade and export to give Americans ourselves a better life."", ""I'm very grateful that I've had a chance to come here to New Jersey today to open the campaign. I would like to say one other thing. You all are vitally committed, loyal, and effective Democrats. We've been through a tough primary season. Senator Kennedy was a formidable opponent. I still have the political scars to prove that statement is true. But since the convention has been over, Senator Kennedy and his supporters have rallied generously and effectively to reunite the country. I couldn't have a better proof of that than the man who's traveling with me this morning, and that's Jerry Doherty."", ""Jerry Doherty is a long-time friend of the Kennedy family. In 1976, when I ran for President, he volunteered to help me in New York State, and although we didn't have very good prospects at the beginning, we carried New York State because of his leadership and his sensitivity and his knowledge about politics. Now he'll be helping us in New Jersey."", ""And I'd like to introduce to you Jerry Doherty, a good friend of Senator Kennedy, a good friend of mine, a good friend of yours, and one of the finest political and most knowledgeable and effective people I have ever worked with. Jerry Doherty, would you raise your hand?"", ""We've got a lot of work carved out for us. A disunited or divided Democratic Party, which we did face several weeks ago, was catastrophic for us and for our Nation in 1968, when Democrats either took for granted or did not support the candidacy of Hubert Humphrey. It was a personal calamity for all of us and also a deep embarrassment and a calamity for our Nation in later months. We don't want the same thing to happen. We need to have a secure nation, a strong defense, jobs, a good secure energy policy, a strong full-employment economy, a united society, free of discrimination, compassion for the sick, the elderly, and the poor, and where workers have a right to organize and to work safely. And, as you know, we've just seen that wonderful thing happen in Poland, and we're very proud of that."", ""As a matter of fact, this is a time in our country's history, too, when a lot of people are claiming their ancestors came from Poland, and I'm not sure they did- [laughter] —but it's a bright and shining day for the workers of the world to see this tremendous demonstration of courage."", ""Finally, let me say this: We've got a lot at stake.

Collectively, you reach the entire Nation every day, and I only reach it, as you know, infrequently, through the public news media and through my ventures out into individual communities. But you are part of me in deciding the future of the United States of America."", ""The other point I want to make is this: I have to conduct the affairs of our country on a daily basis. I can't take a 3-month vacation from being President in order to run a campaign, to attack opponents, to criticize every defect in our societal life, and to make projections of what might happen in the future in an irresponsible fashion. I have to deal with economics, with defense, with international affairs, with peace, with human problems every day."", 'When we have failures and disappointments or delays, which are inevitable, those are going to be highly publicized by the Republicans, most often in a distorted and irresponsible fashion. When we have successes—and I think they are notable—in international matters, in defense matters, in domestic affairs, the Republicans are going to claim that we had those successes not for the benefit of our Nation, but just for some political benefit for us. So be it.', ""The American people have very sound judgment when the facts are presented. I've worked on this campaign, not with trepidation or displeasure or reluctance, but with anticipation and confidence. It gives us a chance in a legitimate democratic way within the constitutional provisions that were prescribed for our Nation more than 200 years ago, to present our case to the people. And if we do that well, I have no doubt that on November 4 we will have a tremendous victory for myself and Fritz Mondale—who I might add is the best Vice President this country has ever seen."", ""I had, earlier, thought that I would make an outline of basic issues and give you a description of this campaign from my own perspective, its progress and its challenges. I'm not going to do that. What I would rather do, if you will accommodate me, is to go out into the adjacent room, and I'd like to shake hands with every one of you individually and get a photograph so that I can remember, the rest of my life, the people that meant so much to me—and that's you.Thank you very much.""]"
34,Jimmy Carter ,"September 15, 1980","[""To Chairman John White, to all of you, let me say that on election day on November 4th, there can be no more important State than Texas. And I'd like to ask you a question: How many of you believe that Fritz Mondale and I are going to be re-elected on November 4th? [Applause]"", ""That's a pretty good majority. How many of you believe we're going to carry Texas? [Applause] Right on. Well, what happens here in the biggest city in the biggest county in the biggest continental State of all will have a great deal to do with what happens in Texas and what happens throughout the country."", 'As you know, in the past crucial results have come from how Texas people voted. When the average working Texans who are interested in the principles on which our Nation was founded, who believe in equality and hard work and dedication, a better life for our children, strong military, peace, go out and vote, the Democrats always win.', 'As a matter of fact in 1960, if a few people in Illinois and about 28,000 Texans had changed their votes, then John Kennedy would never have been President. Lyndon Johnson would not have been Vice President and later President, and the future of our Nation would have been dramatically changed.', ""I know from experience how the people of this Nation look upon the office of President. Because what our Nation is, what our Nation can be, the vision of our Nation is shaped in the Oval Office. No easy decisions come there. No easy questions are answered there, because the easy questions and decisions are solved and answered somewhere else—in the county courthouse or the city hall or the State legislature, the Governor's office, in private businesses, private homes. But those questions that arrive in the Oval Office are complex, difficult, and profoundly important—for our people, individually and personally in a home, for our Nation, and indeed for the entire world."", ""There is no way to win against massive campaign treasuries as are being raised in Texas for my opponent and the influence of powerful people who don't have the best interests of this country at heart, except by dedicated work from volunteers who believe in the future of our country. And that's why I have confidence in you and the outcome of the election the first week in November."", ""If people know the facts, that's the most important single thing we can do. If the American people realize accurately the unvarnished truth about what we have achieved in the past and what we hope to achieve and expect to achieve in the future, there's no doubt in my mind about the outcome of this campaign."", ""We've faced some difficult, troubled times on a worldwide basis the last 3 1/2 years, tremendous economic shocks that have actually brought down the governments of many foreign countries and created chaos in others. Our country has made steady progress. In the last 3 1/2 years, we have added 8.6 million net new jobs for Americans: Hispanic Americans, the employment rate has gone up 22 percent; black Americans, the employment rate has gone up 18 percent. That kind of progress has been made, in spite of a tremendous increase in OPEC oil prices, in spite of tremendous increases in worldwide inflation."", ""And that kind of progress is going to be continued in the future. It's important to a family to have the right to a good education and the right to self-respect, the right to dignity and the right to a job-and as you know, the Democratic Party is the party of jobs and the Carter/Mondale administration is the administration of jobs—now and in the future."", ""There's another element, too, and it's basic human rights—civil rights—the self-respect that can come to someone whose family happens to be poor or who happens to be black, who happens not to speak English very well. When I took over as President there was not that kind of belief among the minorities and among the poor people of this country. The elderly were afraid that social security was going to go bankrupt. Everywhere I went mayors came to me and said: my city is going down the drain, Mr. President—at that time, Governor. We've put together programs that guarantee the honoring of civil rights."", ""We've added 73 percent to expenditures for better education. We have a good bilingual education program. And I think you all know that 4 or 500 delegates to the National—to the National—I started to say National Education Convention-to the Democratic Convention were teachers and educators, because they recognize that they share with me a responsibility for the Nation's future. It's important for a teacher or a school administrator to know that the future of education is bright in America. But it's even more important to a child or to a father or to a mother interested in their children having a better life. So, the Democratic Party is a party of better education. I might say this: There is not a child, a young person in this country now who will be deprived of a college education because of the poverty of a family. We've got a complete, comprehensive program intact that will take care of that need."", ""I just want to make two other points in order to be brief. One is it's important for us to keep our Nation militarily strong. My background is as a professional military officer. I went to Annapolis. I was a submariner. I spent 11 years in the Navy. When I became President I realized that for 8 years under the Republican administrations that the commitment in real dollars to our Nation's defense had been going down. Our country had lost the respect that should come from a commitment to military strength and to will, a respect for government and to national honor. The Vietnam war, the Watergate disgrace, combined with what I've just described to you, had weakened our country in international councils. The spirit of our Allies in NATO had been shaken. We've had a steady real increase, since I've been in office, in commitments to military strength, and also we've strengthened our alliances."", ""This has not been designed for war. It's been designed for peace. And the reason we've kept our country at peace for 4 years and are going to keep it at peace for 4 more years is because our Nation is strong, and we're going to stay strong."", ""And we've brought strength to other people as well, and we've brought peace to other people as well. In Israel, Egypt, Zimbabwe, China, Latin America, there's been a constant strengthening of the relationships between our country and those people and in the process an enhancement of freedom and democracy and a better life. We now have good relationships with a billion new friends in China. We've not lost our friendship and trade opportunities with Taiwan. Mexico, our neighbor to the south—we've increased this year trade with Mexico 60 percent. We'll sell them 10 million tons of American grain. We have tripled trade levels with Mexico in the last 4 years, and have a good relationship not only with Mexico but with Canada, Japan, and others."", ""This kind of thing, the raising of an American banner of decency and honor and strength, not only helps us internationally, but it helps every family in our country, because now we've built upon a good energy policy in order to provide for us a better future life."", ""Our economy has been deteriorating in the past. You can't expect American workers to be efficient with outmoded tools and factories. We are now getting ready to spend the 1980's building on the foundation that we have laid so tediously and with so much difficulty, to create millions and millions of jobs."", ""We have during the next few weeks a chance to tell an accurate story because one of the things that a President must do is tell the truth. Sometimes the truth is not popular, and sometimes the political consequences of it are severe. But a campaign in a democracy like ours is a time to explain, to inventory, to dream, and to describe those dreams when people have their ears attuned to hear. When the lever is pulled on November the 4th, that decides what kind of future our Nation will have and, more importantly, what kind of future that person will have. Will civil rights be honored? Will freedom be enhanced? Will the worth of a human be recognized? Will education be better? Will housing be better? Will we have a better transportation system? Will we have jobs? Will we have progress? Will we have peace? Will we have strength? Will our elderly be secure? Will we honor one another? Will our Nation be unified? Can we be proud that our Government is truthful and decent and honorable? Will there be adequate communication between people and the Government leaders? These are decisions we'll be making all at once on November the 4th when we vote. And if people will listen between now and then and think and assess where should our country be in the 1980's and the rest of this century and the future, I have no doubt that with your help we'll win a tremendous victory on November 4th.God bless you. Thank you very much.""]"

Thank you, Andy and Mayor Jackson, Congressman Patten Mitchell, my friend, Cameron Alexander, Reverend Dr. Roberts, Coretta King, Daddy King:', 'REVEREND KING. Right here. [Laughter]', ""THE PRESIDENT. I was going to describe to you in my opening remarks how far we've come, but I think Maynard Jackson did it better than anyone that I know when he, as a black mayor, referred to a white President as a Georgia boy."", ""[Laughter] I think he pretty well wrapped it up, don't you? [Laughter]"", 'And I can actually say it gave me a warm feeling to hear it.', ""As I was coming in the church a while ago, I was asked a question by a newsman about the importance of this meeting, and I've been thinking about it since I decided to come down here. Several mentioned this. I could not improve on the speeches that have been made so far, and I wish I could sit in on the speeches after I leave— [laughter] —because there are some things that are going to be said that I would really like to hear. But I'll depend on you all to give me a report."", ""If it hadn't been for Daddy King and his beloved wife, I would not be President. Had they not had their son, Martin Luther King, Jr., I would not be President. Had he not been a man of courage and vision and tenacity and faith, I would not be President. And had it not been for the people in this audience—I started to say congregation—I would not be President. You all had confidence in me in 1976, when very few people knew who I was, and there was an actual stigma attached to a southern white politician, a Georgia Governor, that you helped to remove."", ""I have had continual need for you. Once during the campaign I made a remark about ethnic purity, and it almost crippled me fatally. I didn't know what to do. I got a call from Andy, and I got a call from Daddy King; I got a call from many of you. And I decided to come home to Atlanta, had a rally in the downtown square. Four or five thousand people came. All I wanted to do was what happened. I got on the stage, in front of the TV cameras, and Daddy King held my hand. And the people all over the Nation saw it, and it healed the wound that I had done to myself. So, I'm aware of the importance of this meeting, and what was said at the very beginning by Jesse Hill is accurate."", ""This meeting this morning could very well decide the outcome of this election and, more importantly, but significantly, the future of this country. When my Presidency has not always satisfied every one of you—and I acknowledge that's a fact-my phone has been open to you and others that are not here this morning. And you have never failed to use it. I get quick telephone calls, and they're returned. But if my opponent should be elected, you're going to have a hard time getting a telephone call answered at the White House. And if my opponent is elected, I doubt that there will ever be a Martin Luther King, Jr., holiday. And there ought to be one in this country."", 'Daddy King is a great politician. He\'s a great preacher. He\'s a great family man. Now he\'s become a great author. He\'s just written an autobiography, and I hope you\'ll all buy it and read it. I was hoping he\'d give me a copy; he hasn\'t done it yet. I\'ll have to buy one like you will. [Laughter] But in the end he says that, ""I was put here, as the old folks say, on a purpose."" Maybe I was elected President on a purpose. Our country was created on a purpose. Freedom was born in the human breast on a purpose. Courage was created among human beings on a purpose. And we have an obligation to carry out that purpose.', 'I know that Daddy King\'s son once said, ""Man . . . is not very flotsam and jetsam in the river of life, but he\'s the child of God."" And it\'s important that in this Nation at least, as an example for all the rest of the world, that politicians don\'t forget that. That worth of an individual human being in the eyes of God and in the eyes of one\'s fellow human beings—that\'s been forgotten in the past.', ""In this region for too long, politicians who hoped to be elected to the office of county commissioner or mayor or Governor or Congressman or Senator had to divide blacks from whites and had to blame the poverty that afflicted our Nation among white people on the black people and vice versa. But it wasn't necessary to talk to blacks much, because they didn't have the right to vote. And there are some people sitting here who helped pave the way for those rights, which must be protected and preserved—John Lewis, in the audience, Joe Lowry—I'm going to visit him right after I leave here at Martin's headquarters—and Daddy King."", 'Back in the early thirties, Daddy King decided, according to his book, that he needed to have the right to vote for President, because the President\'s decision affected his life and the life of people he loved. He went to the county courthouse here. There were two elevators: one for white folks, one for colored folks; had signs above them so you wouldn\'t make a mistake. One of them was working up to the registrar\'s office. I don\'t think you need to think long to figure out which one was working. So, Daddy King said, ""Well, I\'ll just walk up the stairs."" When he approached the stairs, there was a policeman standing there, and a sign was there, by the stairs, that said, ""White Only."" He kept going back time after time after time, day after day.', 'Eventually the ""colored"" elevator was working, and he was able to get to the registrar\'s office. The registrar told him about the poll tax. Daddy King was willing to pay the poll tax, but he found that you didn\'t have to pay it not just for only yourself but for all your ancestors who had lived in Georgia and hadn\'t paid their poll tax. And finally, that obstacle was removed by the Federal Government.', ""And Daddy King went back as a young man, and they explained that there were 30 questions he had to answer, questions that a political science professor at the University of Georgia could not answer. They were still on the books when I became State senator. That first speech I made in the State senate was to do away with those 30 questions. And in Daddy King's book, he said a lot of black people learned a lot about government trying to answer those 30 questions. It's paying off now."", 'He never dreamed that eventually his son would be a world hero and that we would have black mayors in Atlanta and Detroit, Los Angeles, many other great cities—Birmingham now—many other great cities around this country. He never dreamed that his granddaughter would be in the Georgia legislature, that his daughter-in-law would serve at the United Nations, that Andy Young would be the spokesman for this country, among more than 150 nations on Earth, and would spread the Gospel that was preached on this pulpit throughout the world and that politicians who lead other nations would listen and would say, ""So that\'s what the United States is. I was getting the wrong impression when Richard Nixon was the President.""', ""These changes have been made. We've come a long way. We haven't yet reached the Promised Land that was spelled out so clearly for us by Martin Luther King, Jr., and by many of you who were also very courageous and very tenacious in spite of the most difficult possible obstacles."", ""We're no longer divided, white from blacks. We no longer see so many of our babies die, black and white. We no longer see so many of our young people leave the South because there was no alternative, black and white. We no longer see the devastation of poverty and disease and discrimination sweep through our communities, both black and white. We've made progress. We still have a long way to go."", ""I've appointed all those people that Andy described, and I can tell you this: I have not had to lower the standards of quality and excellence and commitment in order to do it. I haven't done them a favor; they've done me a favor. And I'm not through yet. We've got a lot of other appointments to make."", ""We've had economic difficulties the last few years, as Andy pointed out. But in spite of those obstacles, we've added 8 1/2 million new jobs to the American economy. Employment among black people has gone up 22 percent in the last 3 1/2 years. 1.3 million of those new jobs are held by black people; another million by people who speak Spanish. We've focused those jobs on those that need them most, and the plans for the future are much greater than that. And our Nation hasn't suffered. These are not make-work jobs created in Government. These are permanent jobs, solid jobs, career jobs."", ""We've got a proposal in Congress now to add two more billion dollars to put our young people to work, because we've got so far to go in that respect—a way to tie together the high school graduates and the trade school graduates with the jobs available in that community and make sure they know how to hold a job when they get there and to help tide over that salary payment for those few months as they become qualified. It's going to meld together labor and education now, for a change, and we'll have a much brighter future because of it."", ""We've solved to a great degree the problem of not having an energy policy. And we'll have $88 billion in the future to have help for poor people to pay their energy bills and to have a better transportation system to get to and from work and to create new technology and an exciting life and a dynamic life for our country, to rebuild America's industry and to give our workers tools with which to be more productive. And we are opening up the world, now and in the future, for additional trade."", ""I was in a little steel mill last week in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, the most modern steel mill in the world. The workers there produce more steel per year, each worker, than any other place in the world, and they are selling steel rods to China cheaper, halfway around the world, than Japan can make them and ship them a couple of hundred miles across the China Sea. It's the kind of thing we can do."", ""That valuable relationship with a billion people in China and millions of people in Zimbabwe and other areas of the world that are now our friends is very valuable to everyone here. One of the most emotional meetings I have ever had was with Prime Minister Mugabe in the East Room of the White House just a few days ago—the new Prime Minister of Zimbabwe. This was a terrible political struggle—Parren Mitchell and Andy Young know it—because of tremendous pressures from an ill-informed American public, concentrated on me in the Oval Office, not to stand for democracy, not to stand for majority rule, not to stand for the elimination of racial discrimination all the way over in the dark continent of Africa. But with your help we stood firm, and now there's a freedom there and a democracy there and a majority rule there that's an inspiration to the entire world. And I'm proud that Andy Young was there to help us make this come true."", 'You\'ve seen in this campaign the stirrings of hate and the rebirth of code words like ""States rights"" in a speech in Mississippi, in a campaign reference to the Ku Klux Klan, relating to the South. That is a message that creates a cloud on the political horizon. Hatred has no place in this country. Racism has no place in this country. Daddy King says in his book, ""Nothing that a man does makes him lower than when he allows himself to hate anyone. Hatred is not needed,"" he says, ""to stamp out evil. Despite what some people have been taught, people can accomplish all things God wills in this world. Hate cannot.""', ""Just briefly, let's look to the future. I see a future for this country to be strong, to be united, to be confident, to be inspired, to be even more free, to be employed in useful work, to be well educated, to be united, to be filled with love and compassion one from another. I see a future in this country where those that fought hard to achieve civil rights will continue, in the Federal Government and all other governments, to administer the very laws that they were willing to risk their lives to achieve."", ""I see a Federal court system that's filled not only with a desire for justice but a desire for understanding of the special deprivation of justice that still prevails in this country against those who are poor or inarticulate or not well organized or not well educated. We've got a long way to go in the Federal courts where, still, money available to have competent lawyers is an obstacle to true justice. But whenever I appoint a black judge or Hispanic judge or even a woman judge, I know that they not only have committed in their own hearts a vision of what this Nation ought to be but a special knowledge of the effects of past discrimination that are still there as a means to prevent equality of opportunity."", ""And I see an America where young people don't have to worry about employment. I don't know of anything that's more devastating to a nation than to have a 17- or an 18- or a 19- or a 20-year-old young person, having struggled through high school, sometimes at great sacrifice to the family, having been given talent and ability and ambition and hope by God, week after week after week not be able to find a way to use their talent or that ability—becomes a matter of loss of self-respect and then following that, discouragement and despair and then alienation and then a sense of lashing out at the system that deprived that young person of a chance to be useful in God's world. We've got to continue that effort, and that is still a question in doubt. We have a youth bill in the Congress right now, a $2 billion youth bill to create that kind of opportunity for many of our young people."", 'And we\'ve got another bill in the Congress that hasn\'t yet been passed, that many of you have worked to achieve, to create fair housing implementation. We had a fair housing bill passed in 1968. It hasn\'t been implemented. It\'s passed the House; it\'s in doubt in the Senate. I had a long conservation with Senator Kennedy yesterday on Air Force One, coming back from Texas. He said, ""Mr. President, we\'ve got to work together to get that bill through the Senate. It\'s now come out of my committee, and we\'ll be marshaling our forces to get that fair housing bill passed."" He and I agreed on the phone it\'s the greatest civil rights legislation in the last 10 years.', ""You've not yet been adequately marshaled to put those Senators on the record. And I'd like to ask you this morning, if you don't do anything else in the Congress, to help get that fair housing bill passed. It's important to the future of our country to eliminate the last legal impediment of the right of our people to have equal opportunity by choosing where they want to live. This is extremely important. And the last point I want to make to you is this: Andy Young, Don McHenry, Pat Harris, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Drew Days, Clifford Alexander, many others are now working with me in the Federal Government. I consider all of you to be my partners, as well. I know the importance among those who look to you for leadership for your voice to be heard in shaping our Nation's future. The decision is going to be made on November the 4th about what kind of future we will have."", ""And I ask you to study the platform of the Republican Party. It's not going to be possible in my judgment, although I hope I'm wrong, for me to face head on in a public debate Governor Reagan, the Republican nominee. He's now been deprived by his staff of the opportunity to speak out on the issues. He didn't do too well with the Ku Klux Klan or China, as you know. [Laughter] He was making some progress on evolution, but he cut that off. But it's going to be hard for the people to understand what this election is all about unless you tell them. And collectively, this group in this room can remember what happened to Daddy King and his son and many of those you love as they struggled for the right to vote and how important it is for people to register and take advantage of that right, that cost so much, which is so easily ignored."", 'And I see a nation at peace. Peace is not something that comes to the timid or to the weak. Our Nation is strong-strongest on Earth. Militarily, economically, politically, morally, ethically, our Nation is the strongest on Earth. And if we are strong, the weak need not have so much fear. And if we are at peace, then the world has a much better chance to stay at peace.', ""If we abandon the commitment to control nuclear weapons—which has been a part of the administration of every President, Democratic or Republican, since the time of Eisenhower and Truman—as has been advocated by the Republican nominee, then the chances for the avoiding of a nuclear war in the future will be severely reduced. I'm not predicting war, but I tell you that it's very important for us to stay strong and at the same time search for peace with the Soviet Union and with every other union or nation on Earth that wants to avoid a nuclear holocaust."", ""I'll do my part. The Vice President could make the same speech to you that I've made this morning, and you would have confidence that he was speaking from the heart. You know that. And my Cabinet officers—Andy and all of you know them—have the same philosophy that I have, and those that I've appointed to major positions in the Federal courts, and otherwise, share my commitment that I've described to you so briefly this morning. And all of us will do our part. But I have to tell you that the most important factor is what you do and others like you who are not running for office—at least not running for President, thank goodness."", 'But you see the importance of the outcome of this election. We are indeed talking about two paths to the future. And I believe that our path, your path, is the one that must prevail, but it can very well not prevail, unless you do your share.', ""You remember 1968, how a divided Democratic Party deprived Hubert Humphrey of a chance to serve as President and put Richard Nixon in the White House. A few votes, a few more speeches, a few more radio tapes and TV advertisements could have prevented the Nixon administration taking place. That's what we face this year."", ""Our party has been remarkably unified since the convention. Senator Kennedy is campaigning for me and with me. We'll be together on the 22d in Los Angeles, raising money. But that unity is not enough, unless there's an enthusiasm and a commitment and a sacrificial spirit to help me solve these difficult issues, for which there are no easy answers, now and in the next 4 years."", ""You've got a friend in the Oval Office, and if you'll help me, I'll be there as your friend for the next 4 years."", 'Thank you very much.']"

I'm proud to be here under conditions like that."", ""It's been a pleasure for me to have a chance to go through this modern mill and to recognize that when anyone drives down 1-85 that they know that this area is booming with industry, all kinds of new industry, and also that this is the center of America's textile industry. And I say that even as a Georgian."", ""Since I've been President and during the campaign, when I worked with John West as fellow Governors, I've always heard a lot about the textile industry from your own leaders.

I'm very impressed, too, that you were able to preserve the original building while renovating the inside with the most modern equipment that can be bought. I was also told that all the equipment used in this building is made in the United States of America. I like that. So, you've kept intact the traditions represented by Ollin D. Johnson and the building behind me, but you've also kept up with the times, putting together more efficient tools that can be used by the most productive workers in the world, the workers in America."", ""From my own experience as Governor and in Sumter County, Georgia, where I first started my own political career, I know the importance of textiles, and I know the political importance of people whose families have kept this textile industry so strong in America. It's not an accident that I came here to be with you. As a matter of fact, one out of eight of all manufacturing employees in the United States work in the textile and apparel industry. There are over 2 million jobs at stake, about 150,000 of those, maybe more, in South Carolina. But I also know from personal experience about the way of life that this mill represents."", ""Many of you come from farms. Many of you still farm part-time. I know, because I've seen a lot of pickup trucks parked around this mill, and I know they're used for making a living in other ways as well. Many of you come from families that have worked in the mills for two or three generations. You've seen them grow. You've seen times of prosperity; you've seen times of disappointment and despair. And I know you realize, as well as I do, that the economic health of a textile industry in a community like this determines the economic life or death of the community itself."", ""Modernizing, keeping up with competition everywhere in the world is part of the American character. We've never been afraid of change. We've never been afraid to meet competition. Freedom and the free enterprise system is important to us. And God-fearing, hard-working families can earn a bright future by hard work if investments are made back in the plants and factories where we have to earn our living in this generation and in generations of the future. It can mean whether or not young people can finish high school, go on to college, have a great career; whether they can make a decent living if they decide to stay here or whether they have to move out of a community and go somewhere else. That's why, when I went to Washington, I was determined to sustain and improve the textile and the apparel industries of our Nation."", ""In March 1979, after close consultations with both industry and labor, I announced a new comprehensive textile program. Senator Fritz Hollings, many leaders that you know in the textile industry-workers and management—were in the Roosevelt Room, next door to the Oval Office, when that white paper was decided upon to make sure that the interests of the textile industry were honored in every decision made by the Federal Government. This has paid rich dividends. This comprehensive new textile industry has removed the cloud that hung over our heads for so many years prior to the time that your neighbor from Georgia became President of the United States. And in the last 2 years we've made good progress, with your help."", ""Fritz Hollings, Dick Riley, Senators Holland, Butler Derrick, and others have made sure that I never forget what I promised to do. And we've paid rich dividends to you in the last 2 years. Tomorrow, for instance, after difficult negotiations, we'll sign an orderly marketing agreement with the People's Republic of China. This has been part of our effort to increase American exports of textile goods overseas and at the same time to reduce foreign imports coming into our country. We have increased exports since 1978 alone by 70 percent. This means $2 billion worth of American textiles made in plants like this are now sold overseas. That's completely different from what it was before I became President. At the same time, we have reduced imports coming into this country by 800,000 square yards of material since 1978. That's the kind of trends that you've made possible."", ""Let me hasten to add, before you say it yourself, it's not my achievement; it's not even the achievement of your Governor and those who represent you in Congress. This is your achievement, because if it wasn't for the dedication and hard work and courage and confidence and the efficiency of American workers, with the intense competition from places like Taiwan, Japan, China, Korea, Sri Lanka, India, we couldn't do what I've just described to you. This is your achievement. And on behalf of all the people of the United States, I want to say thank you for what you've done for our country."", ""I want to add one other word, because I think it's important to put it in perspective. We haven't had easy times the last 3 1/2 years. With the tremendous pressure put on us by OPEC oil prices, we've had to hammer out, under difficult circumstances, a national energy policy. We were importing too much oil, buying oil from overseas. The last 3 years before I was inaugurated President, we increased oil imports by 44 percent. Since I've been President, with the help of these men on the stage with me, we have decreased imports by 24 percent. Today, and every day in 1980, we are buying 2 million barrels of oil less from foreign countries than we did the first year I was President. That's a great achievement, and we're proud of it."", ""The thing is that when we import oil, we not only import that product but also we import inflation and we import unemployment. And cutting down all we buy overseas and building up the productivity of American workers is a major responsibility that I have for the future. What's been happening behind me in the Startex plant—modernization—makes sure that American productivity stays competitive in the years ahead."", ""We've solved now, in my judgment, the problem of having an energy policy for our great country. That was done in the late 1970's. In the 1980's we have an equally good chance to solve that problem of keeping America's plants and factories competitive and keeping American workers employed, to give us a firmer family life, better opportunities for our young people, better education, better transportation, better quality of life for us all."", ""It's not going to be an easy time. There's no way for me to stand here and tell you that the problems are solved overnight. You know it takes a while. But our country has never failed. When the American people could understand a question or a problem or an obstacle and we were united, in times of war or peace, depression or prosperity, the United States of America has never failed. And we will not fail to meet these dreams that I've described to you in the years ahead."", ""You might be interested in knowing that this year we have more oil wells being drilled in the United States, more gas wells being drilled in the United States than any other year in history, and we are producing more United States coal than any year in history. What I want to see is not just textiles but all the other elements of American production improve in the future. I want to see OPEC oil replaced on the energy markets of the world with United States coal. That's what I want to see done."", ""Well, I think I'll close my remarks by saying this: I could outline to you a lot of things of which I'm proud, but I think the thing that stays on my mind most-as I look in the faces of southerners—husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, young people—bright with hope, confident of what you've achieved, grateful for the opportunities in this world—I'm determined to keep our Nation at peace. We've been at peace now for 3 1/2 years. If I'm reelected, we're going to stay a peaceful nation for the next 4 years."", ""The Southland has always been in the forefront of patriotism, courage, and dedication. When you look down the list of those honored for heroism, the South is at the top. When you look at the list of those who gave their lives in action to save our country and its freedom, the South is always in the front. We're the ones who know how important peace is, because I don't want my sons and my daughter or your sons and daughters to have to give their lives to defend our country."", ""But the most important way to make sure that we keep our Nation at peace is to keep our Nation militarily strong. It's something I learned at Annapolis. It's something that I learned in submarines as an officer. It's something that I've shared with Fritz Hollings and others. And I guarantee you that as long as I'm in the White House, our country's defense will be second to none in the United States."", ""The last point I want to make is this: I've talked pretty much about material things, and they're important—weapons capable, mills modernized, trade expanding, homes built for people to live in. But the most important thing is our human resources, human beings—how we relate to one another and what kind of life we have."", ""I've had a great admiration for what's been achieved in South Carolina. You led the way, and we followed because of great Governors like Fritz Hollings, Dick Riley, John West, and others, Bob McNair. We learned from you. You've had an ability to see the worth in your young people and prepare them for a productive career. Your education system, your training schools, educational television has just been remarkable, and other States throughout the Southeast and indeed throughout the Nation have learned from South Carolina."", ""And you've been able to see to the inevitability of change. And when a new plant comes into a community, you've had those workers there trained, ready to move into the new plant when it opened, at no expense, quite often, to the people that own and have invested in that new work opportunity. For that reason, foreign investors-and I hate to say this—when they were choosing between Georgia and South Carolina, often came to South Carolina."", 'Now we know that the time has come for the entire country to do what South Carolina has done so well and what the Southland has done so well, and that is to rebuild the industrial base of our country, but to build it on the basis of a better life for human beings, better education, better training, better health care, better housing, better recreation opportunities, clean air, clean water, freedom, strength, peace. Those things are important to me as President, and they are important to you.', ""This is going to be a very important year, because the future of our Nation is at stake. You think back to the depression years and you think back to some of the changes that have taken place for you because Democratic candidates have been successful, with your help, in holding office and compare how you feel about the matters that concern you and your family, and you can see that the future of this Nation depends on what happens on November the 4th, 1980. I believe we'll have that bright future. I feel like I'm a partner with you, and I'm determined, with your help, to make the greatest nation on Earth even greater in the years to come."", 'God bless you all. Thank you very much, everybody.']"

This is the greatest country on Earth. We have never failed to meet any challenge or answer any question or solve any problem if the Nation was united and if Democrats were in the White House and holding the major positions in this country. Right?

Those are the kinds of things that we Democrats are going to keep in this country for the next 4 years, with your help. Will you help us? [Cheers]"", 'AUDIENCE [Chanting]. We want Jimmy.', ""THE PRESIDENT. Thank you very much.

38,Jimmy Carter ,"September 22, 1980","['How many of you believe the Democrats are going to whip the Republicans in Illinois— [applause] —and all over this country? I believe this is going to be true.', ""I came here for a couple of reasons. I wanted to associate myself politically with Alan Dixon and with the Springfield Redbirds—I figured that would help me all through this country—and secondly, to be with my good friends behind me on the platform. David 1 rode in with me from Washington this morning on the plane. He's going to make a wonderful new Democratic Congressman, and I look forward to being with him in January. And Roland Burris and Jerry Consentino, Todd Renfrow, and Speaker Redmond-all of you have an eager ally in me in bringing that victory to Democrats at the local, State, and of course, the Federal level in November."", ""I'm not going to talk very long to you, because I want to shake hands with as many as possible. But I would like to say this: This is a year of crucial decision for our country, and as we approach November the 4th, it's important for us to remember two things. One is the character of the Presidency itself. It's the most important elective office in the world. It's the kind of position that can arouse the hopes and inspiration and confidence and progress of our Nation or have the opposite effect, as we've seen in recent years under previous administrations."", ""There's a place in the Oval Office where decisions are made that are very difficult. There are no easy answers to questions that arise in the Oval Office at the White House. If the questions can be answered easily, then the answers come in a private person's life or within a home or in a county courthouse or city hall or at the State legislature or in the Governor's office. If the answers don't come to any of those places, they arrive in the Oval Office for me and the Members of Congress to try to address. It's a major, heavy responsibility, but an exciting opportunity to see our Nation grow and prosper and to stay at peace."", ""Advisers help: I doubt if there's ever been a better Cabinet than the one I've put together, from Ed Muskie, Harold Brown on down. This is very important to a President. But I have found that the most difficult decisions and the ones that are most important are the ones where your advisers are split almost 50-50. And in that condition, the President, and no one else, has to make that tough decision, deal with that crisis, hopefully so that the crisis that I have on my desk is never even known by you, because a crisis managed well is not catastrophic to our Nation. A crisis that is not handled well can become a crisis for the entire world."", ""So, the nature of the Presidency itself is important for us to remember during this election year. And the second point I want to make is this: The future of our Nation is at stake. I doubt if there's ever been a sharper difference between two major candidates than between myself and the Republican nominee. The only possible exception that I can remember was when Goldwater ran against Lyndon Johnson earlier in the sixties, 1964. Now that choice is not only between a candidate, a party, but also between the two futures that our Nation faces."", ""We've made a lot of progress in this last 3 1/2 years. We've added 8 1/2 million more jobs. We have more agricultural exports this year than ever before in history. We set a world's record in '79, a world's record in '78, a world's record in '77. This year we have increased agricultural exports, even in spite of the restraint on Soviet sales, by 8 million tons—$8 billion, $40 billion in exports this year. And I see your State playing the major role in our Nation's progress and prosperity in the future, with the rich land that God has given you and the enormous supplies of coal, for instance. We have an opportunity to address our energy problems, but also give the families of this Nation confidence in the future."", ""We've kept our country at peace, through strength. As long as I'm in the White House, our country will stay militarily strong, and my top responsibility will be the security of this country and peace for all Americans."", ""And finally let me say this: There is no way for a President to be elected in this country without help from people like you. I've got confidence in what you can do. I've studied the election results many years back, and I've always seen the crucial nature of Illinois in the outcome of an election and also the closeness with which the decision is made in your State."", ""This meeting with me this morning, I hope, will be constructive for our country. It's certainly an exciting thing for me to be with you. And I believe that together, you and I will see new Democratic Congressmen and women, a new Democratic Senator from this State to Washington, and the reelection of Fritz Mondale and me, to give our Nation a better future with a Democratic administration that has confidence in people, confidence in our Nation, confidence in the peace process, and confidence in even a better prosperity for the greatest country on Earth in the years ahead."", 'Thank you very much.

39,Jimmy Carter ,"September 22, 1980","['Leaders of the organizations of working people for California, my good friend Jack Henning:', ""That's one of the best introductions that I have ever heard—beautiful. I, too, am familiar with being quoted out of context by the same crowd. And these are the same people, as you know, who said there are two ways to deal with facts: You can look them up, or you can make them up. Well, now they've found a third way: You can botch them up. And they've really botched this one up. Thank you, Jack. But I don't think you ought to feel too badly about it, particularly since you give a good explanation as you just did. You're the only leader in America, because they've used you in the advertisements, to collect residuals from the Republican National Committee. And if they pay you for using your name, I hope you'll let me know when you collect, because you'll be the first person and this will be the first time that the Republicans have ever done anything in meeting an obligation to the working people of this country. You'll be the first."", ""I'm grateful that you've let me drop by to interrupt your important proceedings, because it means an awful lot to me to be with you. This is an important State in determining the outcome of this election. I do not intend to lose California. If you'll help me on November the 4th, we'll win."", ""I've only got a few minutes, so I'll be brief. But there are a few things that I wanted to say because, although you may have heard them from other people, I want you to hear them from me as the President of the United States, as a nominee of the Democratic Party, and as the one that you've endorsed for reelection."", ""Six weeks from now, the American people will make a very profound choice-a choice not just between two men or two parties but between two futures. And what you decide on that day, you and those who listen to your voice, will determine what kind of life you and your families will have, whether this Nation will make progress or go backward, and whether we have peace or war. It'll be a choice between two very different futures."", ""We've had five decades, since Franklin Roosevelt's time, of steady progress, interrupted on a few occasions by Republican administrations in the White House. We need to continue what the Democratic Party means for this country and what the labor movement of America has meant to the strength of this Nation, not only to your own members, whether this Nation will stand firmly by its commitments to justice, to equality, and to freedom. In keeping these commitments for the last 3 1/2 years, we've faced some of the most difficult problems that this Nation has seen. We have stayed at peace through strength. We've faced up to the first time I ever remember when an outside force could exert economic pressure on our great country."", ""The energy problem is profound. We've taken action, and now oil imports are down 24 percent. We've got over 3,100 oil drilling rigs running right now. We'll have more oil and natural gas wells drilled in 1980 than any other year in the history of our country. We're producing more coal this year than any other year in the history of our country. We've got 10 times as many homes using solar power today as we did just 4 years ago."", ""This steady progress, which comes in recent months, can profoundly affect the quality of your life, because in the 1970's, in the late years, we have been successful in meeting this challenge on energy, which is crucial, and now we're ready to rebuild the industrial complex of this country."", ""As you know, the American worker is the most productive worker on Earth. But the American worker has too long been saddled with obsolescent tools and obsolescent factories, and we've got to have the investment going to give you the tools and the factories and the opportunities to continue to be the most productive workers on Earth in the years ahead. We will revitalize America, look to the future with confidence and with commitment and with unity and with courage in the process, above and beyond normal economic recovery and above and beyond the programs that are now in the halls of Congress. We'll add a million new jobs in the next 2 years, jobs in growing and competitive industry."", ""It's crucial to me, as President and as Commander in Chief, to keep our Nation's defense structure strong. For the 8 years before I became President, 7 of those years we had a decrease in the commitment of American budget funds for defense. Since I've been in office, every year we've had an increase in commitment in real dollars, above and beyond inflation to American defense. And as long as I'm in the White House, this country will be strong, second to none in military power. And you can depend on it. And that's the reason we stay at peace—because we are strong. American people know we're strong; our allies know we're strong; our potential adversaries know that we are strong. We're developing advanced weapons, but I think it's good for us to remember that the best weapon is the one that's never fired in combat, and the best soldier is one that never sheds blood on the battlefield. And that can only come about if our determination to keep America strong never waivers."", ""It's important for us to strengthen our basic industries—steel, automobiles, mining, transportation—also to encourage high technology industries, to expand research and development, to rebuild our transportation system, and to expand exports. And we'll give direct aid to communities and workers that are hit by changing times. Because change is inevitable, we cannot stop and freeze the societal structure of our country. But as those changes take place, it's important to me, and my responsibility along with yours, to make sure that families don't suffer and, as a factory or plant is phased out because of changing circumstances, that we have jobs come into that community to tide those families over for new and productive careers."", ""The American economy must and will be a full-employment economy, and the American worker will continue to outwork, outproduce, and outcompete workers in every other nation on Earth. That's my commitment to you. That is not enough. I listened very closely to Jack Henning when he pointed out what Reagan had done here in depriving labor of an adequate voice in matters that are crucial to you and to your families. We need a new consensus that recognizes that labor ought to be represented at the major decision tables when the future of our Nation is shaped. We are in danger of having some of those important considerations decided against labor unless we've got a President in the White House who can stand in partnership with you. I'm still with you on common situs, and I will veto any attempt to repeal or to modify Davis-Bacon against the interests of the working people of this country."", ""And I might add one other thing. I don't get in political campaigns to lose. Sometimes there is a delay in victory. But I'm still committed to you, and I will support, for your interests and for our national interests, labor law reform. And I believe we'll have it in the years ahead."", ""There's another point I want to make very quickly, and that is that when we rebuild our economy and as we give labor a firm voice in shaping the future of America, we must also expand social and economic justice in America. We must sustain programs for the poor and the unemployed and the elderly and the afflicted and the weak. We need to enact national health insurance. And we need to enact welfare reform and expand youth employment. These kinds of things give us an unfinished work agenda that will be very challenging and also very exciting in the years ahead."", ""In these last 3 1/2 years we've laid a good foundation for a future of an expanding economy, a just society, and a secure nation at peace.

Let the oil companies keep that money and make a decision on how it should be spent.""

They fought against and still fight against the windfall profits tax.', 'They have another very simple answer to all our economic problems—a massive tax cut that would be a windfall for the rich and would rob the working man and woman with rapidly increasing inflation in the future.

This valley is indeed a fine example for us all. Your technology and the innovation that you've expressed is the cutting edge of our economic progress."", ""It's absolutely crucial in these troubled times, when overseas oil supplies are uncertain and their price is rapidly escalating, for us to be energy-secure here in the United States. There are two ways, and only two ways, that we can do this: One is to conserve energy—to save energy, to cut out waste—and the other way is to produce more energy of all kinds here in the United States."", ""Industrial change is inevitable; it's good. There is no way to avoid it, and Americans have never been afraid of change. We are an innovative, pioneer-spirit people, and you have made this clear here in San Jose and throughout this valley. We must have economic health, with new jobs, new opportunities for American workers to remain the most productive on Earth. And of course, our national security itself is at stake. These are also the keys to the future of this city and this region of our great country. Now that we have an energy policy in place, after long and laborious effort by the Congress, we have a chance to literally revitalize the entire American industrial complex."", ""You have indeed made this valley hum with activity. You've made great progress, and you've set an example which I'm sure the rest of the Nation will be eager to emulate. As you know, the same state of art of the computer systems which formerly would have filled a file cabinet or even a room can now be used as a pocket calculator and can also be inserted on an automobile, in a traffic light, in a home, to make sure that efficiency of operation of our entire energy-consuming society is increased substantially. We have an opportunity now also to reduce pollution and to make sure that the quality of our lives is constantly enhanced. Technology is indeed the key, and your technology in this valley has been an inspiration to us all."", 'Our goals have been spelled out very clearly in the Global 2000 report, which indicates to us the challenges to the world society unless we address these issues directly and take action to prevent the catastrophes which could occur from a burgeoning population throughout the Earth, constant depletion of our reserve supplies of oil, coal, and other fossil fuels, and a failure to move forward on technology that gives us renewable supplies of energy derived directly or indirectly from the Sun.', ""We have made great progress in a brief period of time. In just 3 1/2 years, since I've been in office, with the good help of the Congress, we have spelled out for ourselves now in law an opportunity to reduce our dependence on overseas oil. Today and every day this year, we will import 2 million barrels of oil less than we did just a year ago. This is good progress. It's because we've had a 20-fold increase in the allotment of Federal funds for solar power research and development. And because we now have, compared to just 4 years ago, 10 times as many American homes using solar power."", 'I just visited a very exciting exhibit, which will be open to all of you, that shows some of the new ideas that can be put into practical application in your own homes, your own automobiles, and your own communities.

And our goal is that 20 percent of all the energy we use in this country by the end of this century will come directly from the Sun. We've been blessed, as you know, not only with a good climate but with very rich oil, and growing crops can take the Sun and indirectly convert it into energy that we can use, of all kinds. Solar cells, photovoltaic cells, the focusing of the Sun's rays to heat liquid—these kinds of technologies are already known to us. And as the years go by and the price of oil continues to go up, which it will, these will be increasingly economically competitive with the alternative sources of oil."", ""I might say a couple of other things, and that is that the wind, the water, growing crops, indirect beneficiaries of the Sun's rays, have not yet been adequately tapped by the American public. Farmers can move forward with decreased tillage, a minimum amount of cultivation for their crops, and therefore to save fuels that had been used for unnecessary cultivation with tractors. Crops can be cured with direct rays of the Sun instead of using oil, natural gas, and other heat sources."", ""This next year, we'll spend about a billion dollars on solar energy, whereas 5 years ago we were only spending about one-twentieth that amount. This year we're also increasing the search for American energy supplies of a conventional nature. We'll have more oil wells and natural gas wells drilled this year, 1980, than any other year in the history of our country. And you may be surprised to know that this year we'll produce more American coal than in any other year in the history of our Nation."", ""We're exporting large amounts of coal now and can export more in the future to nations overseas when we improve the quality of loading facilities in our ports and our rail and transportation systems on the highways to take that coal to be shipped overseas. In the future, as a major energy source for other nations, I would like to see OPEC oil replaced with American coal. And obviously in every element of life, in our own families and families around the seas, American technology and the use of American inventions can provide millions of new jobs for American workers and at the same time improve the lives of people all over the Earth."", ""We're using agricultural products, as you know, already for gasohol, methanol, and ethanol directly and to make other fuels. This opportunity is burgeoning so rapidly it's almost indescribable. A couple of years ago we had practically zero production of gasohol from the ethanol/ methanol process. This year we'll produce about 135 million gallons. In 1981 that will leap to 500 million gallons. And I have no doubt that that upward trend in producing fuel for automobiles and other vehicles directly from growing crops will be one of the most exciting opportunities for us in the future."", ""Basic research goes far beyond energy itself. Your valley and our Nation have benefited from a major commitment to research and development, both in private technology and also through the defense commitments of our country.

We must know of our strength. Our allies must know of American strength. And political adversaries and potential military adversaries must know that any threat to attack the United States of America would be suicidal on their part. As I've said many times, the best weapons are those that are never fired in combat, and the best soldiers are those that never shed their blood on the field of battle. And to keep our Nation strong and at peace is the major responsibility that I have as President of the United States."", 'In closing, let me point out to you that what has happened in this wonderful community is not only good for yourselves but is an indication of what can happen throughout our Nation, with the new technological advances now being opened to us, with my determination to revitalize the economic system of our country based on an adequate energy policy.', ""When I was running for President in 1976 and came to California, the unemployment rate here throughout your State was almost 10 percent—9.8 percent. That is 58 percent higher unemployment rate than it is now. It's now not much more than 6 percent—still too high—but in the process we have been able to create in California alone 1,461,000 new jobs. This shows what can be done with American ingenuity, a competitive American free enterprise system, getting the government's nose out of the affairs of private citizens and private business through deregulation, and the search for the future that can be opened up to all of us with confidence and with unity and with deep commitment."", ""With your help, I'm determined to see our whole Nation benefit as your community has benefited and to make the greatest nation on Earth, which we love very dearly, even greater in the future.Thank you very much. God bless you all.""]"

Right? That's what they told me in the car on the way out. As a farmer myself, as a businessman and a former professional naval officer, and now as President of our country, it's indeed a pleasure and a pride for me to come here to this beautiful facility. I'm also happy to join your next Governor, Jim McDermott, who's with me this afternoon, and to express my deep thanks to Scoop Jackson for those kind words."", 'This morning on the way from Los Angeles to San Jose, I called Dixy Lee Ray to express my appreciation and admiration for her, to let her know how much I appreciated what she has done in the past with the Mount St. Helens explosion and all the other difficulties that an incumbent must face. A few minutes ago, after we left Portland, we got permission from the air controllers, after my request was recognized, to fly over Mount St. Helens. It was a remarkable sight. The destruction and devastation there are truly awe-inspiring, and the contribution that all of you made to stability and to keeping your wits about you and to facing :he future with confidence in one another and with a sense of unity indeed was a pleasure for me as President and an honor, I think, for our country.', ""I'm also here to salute two of Washington State's most important products-grain and Warren Magnuson. Maggie has one a lot for this State and also for this Nation, and as you know, now being chairman of the Appropriations Committee for the Senate, he has the power and the influence to do a lot more in the future. The appropriations legislation, at this moment, to finance all the functions of the United States Government is being debated and considered by the Congress. Senator Magnuson is in charge. He and I agreed yesterday in a telephone conversation that he ought to stay there in the Senate, not just for this crucial week but for 6 more years."", ""I'm here today, not by accident, but to call attention to the whole Nation to what has been truly the great wonder of the world, and that is American agriculture. It's a wonder of Providence what God has given us, with productive land and with innovative producers as stewards to care for that land and to strengthen our Nation in every possible way. It's a wonder of man's hard work to produce. And I think that you know that this grain elevator behind me—this terminal—is now loading more grain than it ever has since it was first built. It's a wonder of American industry and experience and knowledge."", ""Since I became President, United States farm exports have set new world records in 1977, in 1978, in 1979, and again in 1980. And this year we're going to set—we're going to break every record that's ever been set in American agriculture. In 1980, as a matter of fact, U.S. farm exports will reach $40 billion, up $8 billion above last year—the greatest 1-year increase in history. And today American agricultural strength, as you know, is unsurpassed throughout the world."", ""We're by far the world's largest agricultural exporter. We account for 60 percent of the world's grain exports, 80 percent of the world's soybean exports. These startling figures, almost too high to believe, continue to improve every year. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, never in history have so many been fed by so few. Our success in exporting U.S. farm products is a direct result of aggressive sales and promotion by representatives of the American farmers, producers, shippers, and the Government and of completing a multilateral trade negotiation, within the last few months approved by Congress, which opens up new opportunities for us to sell all kinds of American products with a minimum of interference all over the world."", ""In addition, a great benefit to every person listening to my voice, to your families now and in the future, has been the normalization of relationships between our Nation and the People's Republic of China. This is a major step forward in preserving peace throughout the Pacific region and the Asian region. It's a major step forward in diplomacy, and it's a major step forward in trade, giving Americans jobs now and in the future. A billion new friends, a billion new consumers, a billion eager buyers for all kinds of American products are now available to us because of those normalized relationships. And I might add parenthetically that our relationship with Taiwan has not suffered at all. Our trade with Taiwan at this moment is at an alltime high."", ""The ship behind me will be carrying American corn to Japan. We've opened up trade offices to sell American products in major buying centers throughout the world. We've increased export credits to let sellers of American grain finance those sales on a sound basis to foreign buyers. And we've improved grain inspections, Federal and State grain inspections, to make sure that when customers do buy American grain, they get the highest possible quality and come back again and again to make additional purchases."", ""I'm not only the President, but I'm also the Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces. I want to make sure our Nation is strong. And therefore I would like to certify to you that we need to have a strong American merchant marine fleet to help us to deliver agricultural and other products abroad, and I'm committed to ensuring that we have such a fleet now and in the future."", 'Sometimes we Americans take our abundance for granted. It\'s human nature to complain about things if they are not absolutely perfect. But I think during this election year it\'s a good time for us to stop and say, ""What has God done for us?""-not only freedom, not only a chance to make our own voices heard, not only a chance to be world leaders in raising high the banner of human rights and letting democracy and our way of life be known about throughout the world. Sometimes we take these basic rights for granted.', 'Events recently in Poland, for instance, and our careful, considered, proper response to those moves toward freedom have helped to remind us of our own basic rights. Recently I directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture to extend $670 million in new agricultural credit assistance to Poland. This is the largest such assistance in the history of our country. It means that American farmers will provide some 4 million tons of grain and other farm products to the people of Poland. This demonstrates not just the power of our agriculture but the power of our commitment to human rights around the world.', ""You've benefited greatly in this particular region from the advances that we have made in the last 3 1/2 years. Since January of 1977, in spite of some setbacks because of the unprecedented increase in world oil prices, unemployment in the State of Washington has gone down 17 percent. In Tacoma City unemployment has gone down, measured up to last month, by 27 percent. Employment in Tacoma, in the metropolitan area, has gone up 20,000 new jobs, and of course, employment in the whole State of Washington has gone up 26 percent in just 3 1/2 years."", ""When we overcome, which we are doing very rapidly, the adverse impact, the damage that was done to our economy by seeing the price of oil jump 120 percent in 1 year, the chances for a better life for all Americans in the years to come are obvious to us. We need to look to the future, to have confidence in the greatness of our country, pull ourselves together in a spirit of unity and conviction and also anticipation and hope, and realize that we can make the greatest nation on Earth, with which we have been blessed, even greater in years to come. If you'll help me, I'll help you make that dream come true.Thank you very much.""]"

It's a matter of great concern to us, and that is Israel and its relationship with the United Nations General Assembly."", 'The United States has opposed and we will continue firmly to oppose any attempt to deprive the State of Israel of its legitimate rights as a respected member of the international community.', ""I noted with great pleasure the UNESCO Conference which met in Belgrade last week and which rejected an effort to question Israel's credentials. We will strongly oppose any effort to exclude Israel from the United Nations General Assembly."", 'There is absolutely no doubt that Israel is a bona fide member of the United Nations, and Israel has the right to participate fully in that organization and all of its specialized agencies. The illegal expulsion of a member of the family of nations from the General Assembly would be a challenge to the basic principles of the United Nations. It would raise the gravest questions about the future of the General Assembly and further participation of the United States and other nations in the deliberations of that body. We will not permit it.', 'I am proud to be President of a great nation that stands up for human rights, not only in our own country but around the world, just as this union was standing up for human rights long before most of us were born.', ""I'm proud to have Chick Chaikin as my friend and ally in that struggle because he is one of the most forceful spokesmen for the rights of free trade unions in the entire world, and your support makes it possible for him to be that valuable spokesman everywhere."", ""And I'm also proud to stand before you as the standard-bearer of the one political party that represents the historic concerns of America's working people, and that is your and my Democratic Party of the United States."", 'I lead this party as its nominee in the crucial election of 1980 because of your help.

I'm very proud to run with the support of a union that believes that our society has a moral obligation to do the most for those who have the least. That's what compassionate, democratic government is all about. That is what this campaign is all about. That is why you and I are fighting side by side, and that is why you and I are going to win November the 4th."", ""I feel confident about that prediction because this union has been fighting and winning for 80 years. You have fought for better wages, better working conditions for your own members, but you've done something more than that.-For 80 years, you've fought to make our country live up to its own ideals. You've never cared what color someone might be or what nationality or what language they might speak or what sex they are or what religion they practice, because this union is serious about equality and social justice and democracy."", 'Five weeks from tomorrow the American people will make a choice that will affect every gain that you have fought so hard to achieve for the last 80 years. All of those gains, all of that progress is at stake, from the minimum wage to human rights. Never in my lifetime has our country faced such a stark choice—between two parties, yes, between two candidates, yes, between two totally different philosophies, yes; also, between two futures, for you, for your families, for those you love, and for our country.', 'I came here to talk to you briefly about that choice and what it means to working people and, especially today, about working women. It should be an easy choice, because all you have to do is follow the same good advice the ILG has been giving for years. When you pick a candidate and when you pick a party, just look for the union label.', ""Before a candidate tells you what he's going to do, first find out what he's already done. I think that's a pretty good standard. Before someone says he's a friend of the working people, take a look at his record. Look at which candidate stands up for the needs of America's working people, which party looks out for the people who have to work day in and day out, which candidate has fought with you, alongside of you, when the working people's interests were at stake."", ""Let me tell you briefly where I stand, what I've been fighting for with your help since the first day I was inaugurated President."", ""I believe, as you do, that people have a right to a decent living, and that's why we fought together for the largest and most certain continual increase ever in history in the minimum wage. We won that fight over tremendous opposition, and now 4 million Americans are living better lives today and all Americans, because of that, really live better lives."", ""I believe, as you do, that in the nation with the richest agriculture in the history of the entire world there can be no excuse for allowing anyone to go hungry. And that's why you and I fought to eliminate the cash requirement for purchasing food stamps. And we won that fight, and a lot of people today are not hungry because we fought together."", ""And I believe, as you do, that every worker has a right to be employed in a place that's safe and healthy. And that's why we've worked to improve OSHA and successfully defended it against attempts to destroy it. These attempts might still be launched in the future, but with you and I working together they will not succeed, and Americans will be protected where they work."", ""And I believe, as you do, that the best way to put young people to work is not to guarantee them lower wages, but to give them the training and the work experience they need to fit into the job market. I want to make sure there's a job for every young person to fill. As a matter of fact, I want to be sure that in America, there is a job for every person who's able to work to fill."", ""Full employment is my goal, and full employment is your goal. And that's why I'm working with the ILG to protect jobs from unfair import competition. And that's why you and I've worked together to increase American textile exports. In the last 2 years, we've had some success. Textile imports in the last 2 years are down, and in the last 2 years, American exports of textiles are up $2 billion. That trend is in the right direction, and we're going to keep it moving that way. This is your characteristic, because for 80 years you have fought to eliminate the sweatshop. And we must not let the sweatshop win, from abroad, the battle that you won against the sweatshop here at home."", ""And for many reasons that I will not go into today, I believe that Government has the responsibility to deal with the challenge of foreign oil dependence. Recent news broadcasts make this vividly clear. I do not believe that the answer to that challenge is to do away with the windfall profits tax and to turn our energy future over to the oil companies. And if I should lose this election, that's what'll happen. Therefore, we will not lose."", ""And I also do not believe that the answer to our Nation's complex economic problems is a monstrous, ill-conceived tax giveaway to the very rich—Reagan-Kemp-Roth, a plan that would give the most to those who already have the most, a plan that may be the most ill-advised and inflationary proposal ever put before the Congress. I believe that the real answer is for you and me to work together not only to defeat Reagan-Kemp-Roth but also to defeat those who support it."", 'And more general in nature but equally important, I believe that the real answer is a good partnership between labor, business, and the public, to revitalize and to modernize American industry, to help American workers become even more productive and where necessary, better trained. With your help we will build that partnership and achieve those goals. Every one of these positions and many more that I could name carries the ILG union label, and so does this one: All Americans, women and men alike, should have the same fundamental rights. And those rights should be enshrined where the rights of Americans are supposed to be enshrined, in the Constitution of the United States of America.', 'We simply cannot afford top public officials who ignore the real problems of American working women, who would deny women the constitutional protection of their equal rights, who seem to believe that women, like children, should be seen and not heard. I totally reject that view. I support ERA. Not only do I support ERA, but my six predecessors in the White House also supported it, Democratic and Republican Presidents. Even the Republican Party supported ERA for 40 years, until this year. The new Republican leaders have turned their backs on American women. Some of them say they are not opposed to women\'s rights; they just want to let the States do it. That\'s what the enemies of women\'s suffrage said 70 years ago, ""Leave it to the States."" That\'s what the enemies of civil rights said 20 years ago, ""Leave it to the State.""', 'Throughout the United States there are hundreds and hundreds of laws that discriminate against women. Fragment this series of laws among 50 different States, and you get some idea of what leaving it to the States really means. Make no mistake, this is not just a theoretical question. Equal rights for women is a bread and butter issue. For every dollar that men are paid, women are only paid 59 cents for the same amount of work. That is wrong. In many parts of our country women cannot work or borrow or dispose of their property on equal terms. That, too, is wrong. Equal pay for equal work!', ""Equal pay for equal work is a standard that ILG set a long time ago. It's the time now that the rest of the country caught up with you. Women make up 43 percent of the work force; a fourth of American households are headed by women—more and more American families depend on the wages that women bring home. When we help women to achieve greater economic rights, we are helping the American family. That's why we must put muscle behind our antidiscrimination laws, why we've toughened the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, why I personally have appointed more women to top Federal positions and more women judges to the Federal bench than all previous Presidents in the 200-year history of our Nation combined. And that's why we have boosted women employees in the Federal Government by 66,000, at a time when overall Federal employment was going down because of increased efficiency. And that's why we've strengthened the support of day care, why we've pioneered pacesetting innovations like flexitime and compressed time to help women meet both job and family responsibilities."", ""I'm the father of a little girl, and I'm also the grandfather of a little girl, and I want them to have the same kind of opportunities that my sons and my grandsons have."", ""I'd like to remind you again that ERA is not just a question of laws; it's a clarion call to end an historic injustice. It's a signal that we are really one Nation, with liberty and justice for all—all men and, at long last, all women. You understand the special problems of working women, because more ILG'ers are working women, women who work to support themselves and their families, women whose paychecks are not a luxury but a necessity."", ""You've not had an easy historic road. The men and women of the ILG have worked to send your sons and daughters to college, to law school, to medical school, sometimes based on the lowest possible wage. One of my own assistants in the White House, in fact the one who helped me write this speech, is the grandson of two members of the old local 38. His grandmother was a sweatshop seamstress at a time when the great shirtwaist strike of 1909, when 20,000 people, most of them women, rose up to demand the right to be treated with simple human decency. That strike holds a lesson for today's battle for ERA. On the ILG picket lines, immigrant girls of 14 and 15 years of age were joined by wealthy women from the suffragist movement; the women of 5th Avenue and the women of the Lower East Side joined together in solidarity because both believed in the dignity of women as human beings and also because both groups of women believed in the promise of America."", 'All of us who are fighting for ERA today are part of that same battle which began so many years ago. We must persevere until the battle is won and the equal rights amendment is inscribed in the Constitution of the United States.', 'But let me say, in closing, that the rights of women, the rights of minorities, the rights of those who are afflicted and oppressed, the rights of free speech and free expression, the rights of working people to organize and bargain collectively-these are fundamental human rights. They are the rights that our Nation represents. These are the rights that are worth fighting for, and these are the rights of our Nation which I will defend as long as I am President.', 'Let me dip just once more into ILG history before I close. Many of you will remember the old Italian Dressmakers Local 89 radio program on WEVD. The program always began with a song. The title of the song was ""Bread and Roses."" That same phrase—""Bread and Roses""-was one of the most famous rallying cries of the early American labor movement. It meant, of course, that labor was not struggling only for material benefits, but for the value and the ideals that give life its meaning and its beauty.', 'That old rallying cry is as good a description as any of what our country means to our own people and also to people all over the world. I want to continue that struggle side by side with you over the next 4 years. So let us go forward together to win an election and to build a future that gives us bread—and roses, too.', 'Thank you very much, and God bless you.']"

We've done that, and I believe in addition to that we've addressed some of the crucial issues of this Nation outside the government arena that are important to all of you."", ""Our Nation was becoming dependent upon foreign oil with a steady upward increase in imports, making us not only rob ourselves and import oil and inflation and unemployment but also put our Nation potentially under the control or influence of foreign powers who don't share the commitments and ideals that we hold so dear."", ""I've only been in office 3 1/2 years, but we've made good progress.

But the American people have rallied, and we have actually cut the importing of foreign oil by 24 percent. And we've also measured it so that each day now, in 1980, we import 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same day in 1977. At the same time, we've put into the consciousness of America the knowledge that we must conserve energy and produce more energy of our own."", ""I just came this morning from Detroit, from Flint, and saw a remarkable demonstration of the production of high-quality, safe, durable, efficient automobiles that made me proud as President, as an American, and I hope will make you just as proud, and I hope that in the future, when you get ready to trade your automobiles, that you'll go to the showrooms where American cars are sold and look at those new products.

We've got unmet needs in civil rights, in human rights. And one of the most important things that's impressed on my mind today: I'm the father of a beautiful little girl; I'm the grandfather of a beautiful little girl, and I want to be sure that when my daughter and granddaughter face the future, they have the same equal rights as men guaranteed in the Constitution of the United States."", ""I have to admit to you that I cannot understand people who deliberately distort this ERA amendment. What it says is—and listen to this—what it says is not anything about homosexuality; it's not anything about men and women using the same bathroom; it's not anything about women being drafted. That's a bunch of baloney. What the amendment says is that neither the Federal Government nor any State government can pass a law which discriminates against women. It's all it says. Got that? That's what it says."", ""That's the kind of future that can only be spelled out through the political process. It's not just a matter of theoretical rights. It's a matter of guaranteeing working women, whose children depend on them, that when they do a full day's work equal to the man next to them, they get the same pay. Now a woman on the average in this country for the same level of work gets only 59 cents for every dollar received by men. There are hundreds of different laws all over this Nation, from one State to another, that deprive women of a right under certain circumstances to own an automobile or to get property if their husband dies, or to know how she can be continued in a productive and safe financial life. That's a serious blight on our country."", ""I don't want to mislead you, because you've endorsed me and because this is a happy day for me to be here. There will be times when I as President, even in spite of what I've said about partnership, will not always agree with you. That's obvious. I can't agree with every proposal you make and also agree with every proposal that other groups in this country make, as President. I cannot promise you that there'll be unlimited Federal resources to meet every demand that's presented to my desk in the Oval Office. I can't promise that every new program will be passed through the Congress without delay, even if you and I agree that it ought to be done. I can't promise you that there will not be difficult challenges in the future and tough decisions to be made. But I do tell you that we share the same goals and the same ideals and the same hopes in the future."", 'And as this election approaches, you need to remember what the consequences might be if the wrong decision is made, because I face a Republican candidate formidable in his political strength and in the finances accruing to his campaign, who offers us an uncertain kind of future based on improbable promises and illconsidered proposals that affect us at home and also affect us abroad.', ""He's spoken about the problems of working families and of the poor, yet he proposes the same formulas that long ago broke faith with the majority of Americans. He's praised publicly the newborn free trade unions of Poland, but he's failed to provide the same support for the free trade unions of the United States."", 'He\'s against full rights for American workers. He opposes the minimum wage. It\'s hard for me to believe that working people would vote for a President who has said, not a long time ago, but this year, and I quote: ""The minimum wage has caused more misery and unemployment than anything since the Great Depression."" He also said this about the Humphrey-Hawkins bill: ""The Humphrey-Hawkins bill was a design for fascism."" And he also said, ""Fascism was really the basis for the New Deal.""', 'Only a year and a half ago he backed the elimination of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and he still talks about drastically weakening OSHA. He once called unemployment compensation little more than paid vacations for freeloaders. He opposed Medicaid and was a nationwide leader in the campaign against Medicare.', 'He was against aid to New York City and against aid to Chrysler. As a matter of fact, when Chrysler was on the verge of bankruptcy, he said, ""What\'s wrong with bankruptcy?"" And his attitude toward New York City was identical when he said, ""Every morning my first prayer and every night my last prayer of the day is that the Federal Government will not bail out New York City."" Now, a few weeks before the election, he said he\'s changed his mind. But when hundreds of thousands of jobs were at stake and the integrity of our greatest city was at stake, his voice was loud and clear.', ""Despite his record, he's campaigning as a friend of the working people and the man with all the simple answers. He says solving the energy problem is simple: No windfall profits tax—just turn it over to the oil companies; they'll make the decisions for us."", ""And solving our economic problems is just as simple: Pass a massive election year tax cut, Reagan-Kemp-Roth. It would be a windfall for the rich and an inflationary disaster for the working people. And when he got a chorus of criticism from economists of almost every persuasion, he revised his economic program about a month ago. But his numbers don't add up. Instead of budget surpluses or even a balanced budget, it would bring on massive new budget deficits and unpredictable levels of inflation, over $100 billion deficit in 1985 alone. And between now and 1987, the tax cuts that he proposes from the Federal Government amount to a thousand billion dollars."", ""This tax cut would pump those billions of dollars, consumer dollars, into an already inflationary economy and bid up the price of every consumer item that you would have to buy, without investing first, at all, in the productive capacity of the Nation, that we need. Only one dollar out of ten of his tax cut would go for job producing investments, and what's more, there's nothing in his simplistic answer for rebuilding the economy of our older cities, of the Northeast or the Midwest. There's nothing for ports, nothing for railroads, nothing for retraining workers, nothing for research. The result would be an inflationary whirlwind that would steal back in higher prices the few dollars an average family would get in tax cuts."", 'Because of its inflationary impact even Business Week and former President Ford oppose this Reagan-Kemp-Roth tax cut, and George Bush earlier called it, accurately, ""voodoo economics.""', 'My opponent has another simple solution for Government spending. Two weeks ago he repeated his promise to place the burden of massive Federal programs on State and local governments. As you know, he had a similar proposal 4 years ago to turn back $90 billion in Federal programs. He said recently he wanted to put those Federal programs back, but of course, the price had gone up because of inflation.', ""This year he left out the details. What are all these programs he wants to turn back to be financed by local and State government? How will the local taxpayers pay for them? How much will property taxes have to rise, for instance, on your local and State governments if you have to pay the full cost of welfare? Think about the property tax burden that will fall on you. He owes the American people some of these answers, but so far we've not had any of those answers."", ""We don't need that one-dimensional kind of thinking that government is the source of all problems and that the solutions are so simple and so easy. The plain fact is that our problems require everyone to work together, a partnership of government and labor and management and business and the American public. We need to draw the best out of everyone to deal with problems that are genuinely difficult and complicated. We need to draw on our strength as we have when our Nation's been threatened in the past, with the First World War, the Second World War, the Great Depression, the Vietnam war, the social problems that were brought about by the end of racial discrimination. Those are the kinds of challenges that our Nation has met successfully if and when we worked together. They weren't resolved by simply lashing out at scapegoats like the Government or providing simplistic answers that wouldn't work."", ""Those are some of the reasons why I'm so happy to have your endorsement, because I know that this country has the best and most productive public employees—Federal, State, and local—of any nation on Earth. I've worked at every level of government for the past quarter-century. I know from personal experience the dedication that you bring to your careers, public service. Most people know that public employees keep our Nation safe, our roads in good condition, our schools open, our water and air clean, our work places healthy and safe, our elderly and our sick cared for, our laws enforced, and perform countless other necessary services day and night. And I'm glad to give thanks where it's due. I thank you for the hard work and the professional skills that you bring to your jobs, and I thank you for your support."", ""I don't want you to forget the importance of a decision to be made 5 weeks from now. I'll do all I can; so will Fritz Mondale, your friend; so will my wife and others in my Cabinet and those on the stage. But the decision will be made by you and people like you. And I hope that this next 5 weeks that you will add some of the sacrifice that you have devoted to your own jobs to this campaign, because the result of what happens November 4th could have more of an impact on your life and on the future of your family and the future of this Nation than perhaps any other decision that you will make in a long time."", ""So, I hope you'll join me not' only as partners in administering government but partners in this campaign. Your endorsement is wonderful, but your personal voice and your influence among your friends and those who listen to you and respect you, this next 5 weeks, will be crucial. New York State can make the difference in the entire election outcome for the Nation, and what happens in this region here and what happens in your own communities all over this State can spell out the difference for the future of our country."", ""I want to join together with you in sweeping New York State on November 4th. One more word: If you do your share, I'll do mine, and on November 4th we will whip the Republicans together. Right? [Applause]""]"
44,Jimmy Carter ,"October 01, 1980","['Thank you very much, Phil and Doug, John, for the good tour through this wonderful plant.', 'Congressman Brodhead, Congressman Ford, and my fellow automobile workers:', ""I'm very glad to be with you. As a matter of fact, I'm a member of local 900, not the Atlanta local—dues paid up for a lifetime. [Laughter] And also I've got my coat to prove that I'm one of the chief inspectors of this wonderful plant."", 'As you know, there is a new spirit here, because this area is an area of winners, all the way from this new Ford plant at Wayne to the Detroit Lions. And when this new model year is over, I know you\'ll be able to point to the foreign competition, no matter where it might come from, and say, ""Another one bites the dust."" And after the football season\'s over, I\'m going to get Billy Simms to help me with the automobile industry everywhere and to keep the world at peace and to do other important things that I know he can help handle.', ""Well, this is an exciting day for me. It's exciting because my heart is filled with gratitude for what I've seen. I wish that every single citizen of the United States of America could have gone with me through this plant. I've just seen some of the best designed, best built, most up-to-date automobiles in the world rolling off this assembly line at full capacity. This is American ingenuity and it's American teamwork at its best, and I'm very proud of every one of you and grateful for what you're doing here."", 'The new model introductions each fall have always been exciting. I remember, as a boy in Georgia living on a farm, studying the magazine ads as the new models for each year were revealed, and then as soon as I could get a chance to go to the county seat over in Americus, Georgia, I would go there and look with wide-open eyes at the new American cars in the local automobile dealerships.', ""This visit here, though, is doubly exciting, not just because of the new models I've seen but because this will be the year that we begin to turn around the American economy, and especially in our automobile industry. We have been hit by severe shocks. The origin of them is the multiplication of the price of OPEC oil."", ""American consumers attitudes have changed, and you have responded to meet that challenge. And I can tell you, with the greatest sense of being absolutely right, that there's a new spirit of cooperation and partnership and friendship and consultation and shared responsibility between the Government, the management of our automobile manufacturers, the automobile workers, to face the future with success. There is no other automobile industry on Earth that could have accomplished more quickly or more completely this fundamental shift that's taking place in our country in automobile production."", 'Since 1974 alone, the fuel economy performance of American-built cars has improved by nearly 50 percent—and the rate of improvement now is much greater than it has been even in the earlier years-while the mileage of foreign competitors since 1974 has stayed the same. In just 1 year, fuel efficiency in this country has increased by 20 percent in some models. No other competing country even comes close.', ""No other country builds safer cars that offer more protection in a collision. No other country makes cars that are more durable. I know that you put your best in building them and the workers are more directly involved now than before in quality control, because your stamp of workmanship and pride is on every automobile that rolls off this assembly line. I know that you're proud of them, and I believe that all Americans are proud of the dramatic progress that you've made."", ""Today, as President, I urge American consumers to go into the showrooms around this country and test drive these new American cars. There's not a better built, safer, more durable, or more efficient car today than these new American models, and the American buyers ought to remember that because it's important to us all."", ""And I urge other countries who want to sell their cars in the United States to do as some foreign manufacturers have already done—locate more of their plants in this country and employ American workers. Perhaps when Americans go new-car shopping, they'll ask their dealers, was this car built in the United States. That's a good question. American automobile workers deserve the chance to compete, and as President, I urge American buyers to give you that chance."", ""In the next few months we'll be buying thousands of new cars and trucks with American taxpayers' money, and I'm going to make certain that they'll be American-made automobiles and trucks, because they are first rate and they're world class, but they're only the beginning. In the next 5 years—this is almost hard to believe—our automobile industry will invest almost $80 billion to produce even more fuel-efficient, high-quality advanced cars that the American public will be eager to buy. This is twice the cost of the Apollo program that went to the Moon, in just half the time."", ""And I pledge to you that as President I'll use the full resources of my own office to ensure that the American automobile industry has access to the capital it needs to retool, to compete, and to maintain its rightful share of the American automobile market. That's been my commitment in the past, it's my commitment now, and it will be my commitment in the future. And Phil Caldwell has. pointed out to you, which I need not repeat, some of the steps that we've already taken."", 'My administration—President, Vice President, Secretary of Transportation, and everyone else—will stay right in the trenches with the UAW and the American automobile industry until we restore this industry to its full productive health. I will not rest until the working men and women in the auto industry are back on the job with full-time, steady work.', ""As President I've made it absolutely clear to our foreign competitors that the United States will not abandon any portion of our share of the domestic automobile market. We've asked the ITC to give us an early ruling on the claims that have been made by the UAW about unfair foreign competition. And as you know, I have also authorized the imposition of a 25-percent duty on trucks that were previously assembled by subterfuge in this country. I expect our foreign competition to practice restraint during this time of transition, as I've counseled them to do."", ""I also want you to know that you're part of something larger than the automobile industry. Something special is happening in this country—the rebuilding of our entire economic base. To do the job right, we need to include labor, business and Government in a solid partnership, something that we've already begun in the automobile industry. Yesterday I announced a similar move which will revitalize the steel industry in our country."", ""The economic revitalization program that labor helped to develop will create an additional 1 million new jobs in the next 2 years, jobs in growing and competitive industries. We'll modernize our basic industries, such as steel and automobiles. We'll encourage high-technology industries. We'll expand research and development to keep us in the forefront, on the cutting edge of progress. We'll rebuild our transportation system, so important to you. And we'll expand exports. We'll aid communities and workers that are hit hard by inevitable change. And when we are finished, the American economy will be a full-employment economy, and the American worker will continue to outwork, outproduce, and outcompete the workers of any other country on Earth. And you can depend on that, if we work together."", ""The reason I'm so confident is because the auto industry is again taking the lead. I remember that during the depression, Franklin D. Roosevelt asked autoworkers and makers to move up the new model year introductions to help our staggering economy. The industry responded and helped to stimulate the economy at its lowest point. During World War II, the President again turned to the auto industry, and you helped to make America the arsenal of democracy. I see that same spirit exactly here today, and I'll leave here much more encouraged than I have been before."", ""Let me make just one final point. Just 5 weeks from now, as Doug pointed out, the American people will make an important decision. I'm not going to mention politics, but I'll just say that I intend to be your President when a constant stream of ships full of American-built cars are unloading in Tokyo and Yokohama, and I want your help to make that come true."", 'Thank you very much.']"
45,Jimmy Carter ,"October 06, 1980","[""Well, first of all let me say that I'm delighted to be here."", ""As President it's always helpful to bask in the glory of two very fine and popular political leaders—Gaylord Nelson, who is looked upon throughout this Nation as the protector of the small business enterprises of our Nation, the protector of the free enterprise system, and one of the most dedicated men I've ever known to helping provide a better life and better jobs for all the people of America. You are indeed fortunate to have him specifically concentrating not only on nationwide problems but on the opportunities in this great State of Wisconsin."", ""And Clem Zablocki, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House, is one of those men that I have to work with on a daily basis in trying to keep our Nation strong, first of all, and keep our Nation and the world at peace. It's always good to have a man like him, who's completely versed in the very complicated international affairs, but still who keeps his roots very close to the people of this Nation. And he understands the particular makeup of our great country, a country of refugees, a country of immigrants, a country of people who've come here from almost every other nation on Earth and who've invested our lives in better opportunities for our children and also more freedom for ourselves."", ""So, I'm indeed honored to be with these two fine men."", ""I had a chance to ride with Mayor Maier and his wife from Washington, and I was welcomed outside by Mayor Barlich. I'm very proud to have both of them here. And the officials of the school, the instructors, the students have already made my visit a successful one, even in the brief time that I've had to spend."", ""This school, which is the largest one of its kind in the entire world, serves during a year's period of time about 70,000 Americans, those who already have a good life that want to have a better life. And this school, in my judgment, represents what our Nation is all about. We Americans believe in carrying our own weight. We believe in independence for ourselves and also for our beloved country. And this school offers the skills and the knowledge that all of us need, particularly the graduates of this school, to be productive citizens. It helps you to help yourselves, and it helps our Nation in the process."", ""You all have your own personal goals, you in this room and all those listening to my voice. You want to become even stronger breadwinners for your families. You want to become independent and respected members of a cohesive community. You want to plan for the future. You, like I, want to give your children an even better life than the one we've enjoyed, and we want to be secure in our retirement years."", ""Today we do face tough economic problems in this country. They're complicated; there's nothing simple or easy about them. Those challenges, if not met successfully, can stand in our way to the fulfillment of the life that we want so much. They can obstruct our economic goals, they can prevent our children having a better life than we have, and they can also prevent our Nation from being secure, prosperous, and at peace. As President, I am determined to meet those economic challenges and to resolve the economic problems for the best interests of all Americans. I've worked very closely with the working families of this country and the leaders who represent them, in and out of the labor union movement itself."", ""We've got to face, also, specific challenges like the overdependence on foreign oil, which was becoming a debilitating circumstance for our Nation. Over the few years before I became President, every year we were importing more and more of our oil and had reached the point where about half of the total oil consumed in this Nation came from overseas."", ""As we import a shipload of oil, we also import inflation and unemployment. So, the Congress and I have worked closely together, hammering out for ourselves an energy policy for our Nation. It's been remarkably successful already, although it's only been on the books a short time. We've cut down our imports of foreign oil by about 24 percent, and each day this year we import about 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same day the first year I was in office—a remarkable achievement by the people of this country, who see this threat to our economic future. I'm determined that we'll continue this progress to make sure that our Nation is independent on energy and that we control inflation and unemployment resulting from this high dependence on imported oil."", ""We're also facing the problem of declining productivity growth. American workers are still the most productive on Earth. We produce more per hour worked, per year worked in this country than any other people on Earth. But our rate of increase of production per hour or per year has not been going up well; in fact, it's been declining a little bit lately. And that's because we've not had enough money invested in giving our workers the new tools and new factories that would let them continue to be more productive as time goes along and to compete with foreign suppliers of goods. But I think now we've turned the corner on that."", ""We've got to do it by revitalizing American industry—here again, a very complicated process, because you've got to do it with tax provisions that will let people invest in those new factories and new tools, and you've got to do it with the maximum dependence on the freedom of our free enterprise system. We've tried to get the Government's nose out of the private affairs of the free enterprise system and have had remarkable success recently with the deregulation of the airline industry, the trucking industry, the rail industry, the financial institutions industry. Cut down on paperwork and let competition give industry a better chance to survive on its own, in freedom, and at the same time give consumers better prices for highquality products."", ""America's strength doesn't come from giant corporations; it doesn't come from the Federal Government; it doesn't come from the State or local governments, either. It comes from the work and the ingenuity and the dedication and the skills of American workers. I'm determined to see our country make the most of this great strength, and I want to make sure that all those who graduate from this school and other schools like it around the Nation have the greatest possible opportunities to provide for yourselves and for your own families. This also, in the same process, provides for the best future of our country."", ""To improve worker productivity, we need to build the new plants and modernize those that presently exist. There's no way to stop change; circumstances economically in our own country, in a given community, and around the world are going to change. But Americans have never been afraid of change. We've always been on the cutting edge of change. Ready with the freedom that we have, with the good education systems that we have, with the research and development that we know, we've been the ones that carve out the benefits from new ideas and to make our competition with other nations in the world more and more successful. But I have to tell you that world competition is becoming more challenging, more difficult every year. And we need to win that competition. But you don't win a war with obsolete weapons; you don't win a competition, economic war with obsolete tools."", ""I'd like to point out, since this is a political year, the stark difference between myself and my opponent for President in how to deal with these questions I've just described to you. Governor Reagan proposes a tax program called Reagan-Kemp-Roth. This proposal would provide massive inflationary tax cuts across the board, amounting between now and 1987 to a Federal income tax reduction of a thousand billion dollars, a trillion dollars. These tax cuts would add billions and billions of dollars to the Federal deficit and would mean the printing of more and more Federal money, dollars that would become more and more worthless, and inflation would rob every family."", 'This Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal is like quicksilver; it glitters. It promises quick results, easy answers, but it ends up being worthless except for the very rich, who would benefit greatly at the expense of the working families of this country. It\'s been condemned even by Business Week as inflationary. George Bush, who is Governor Reagan\'s running mate as Vice President, said it would create inflation in excess of 30 percent, and he called it ""voodoo economics."" Even President Ford, who supports Governor Reagan, says it\'s too inflationary for him to support.', ""We can't deal with our problems offering something for nothing just in the last few weeks or a month of a political campaign. We have to face the facts, and sometimes these facts are very difficult; sometimes, almost always, they are very complicated. And the facts are that you can't give giant tax cuts, giant increases in spending for a nuclear arms race, balance the budget, stop inflation, all at the same time. I have great confidence in the sound judgment of the American people, and I have no doubt that they'll reject this Republican economic program of implausible promises, improbable assumptions, and ill-considered proposals. This creates in the people's minds increasingly, day by day, uncertainty and doubt about the future."", ""There's another Republican proposal that I'd like to mention to you now that concerns me very deeply and ought to concern every person that lives in our country, and especially those who live in Wisconsin, who pay State taxes and who pay local property taxes. Governor Reagan has proposed that the programs for education and welfare be shifted to the shoulders of the local and State governments. This for Wisconsin means a shift of about a billion dollars a year to pay for the welfare programs that he would put as your responsibility."", ""There are only two ways he could do it. He's called for some sort of change in tax sources. This would either require that property tax and other taxes in Wisconsin would have to go up a billion dollars, which would cost the average family in this State $870 a year in increased property taxes; or else he would have to transfer literally billions and billions of dollars from the Federal Government to local governments in some sort of a massive, undefined, revenue-sharing program that he's never spelled out to the American people. If he did that, it would further aggravate the tremendous cost in inflation and Federal deficits of the Reagan-Kemp-Roth tax proposal."", 'This kind of confusion creates doubt and uncertainty about the future. As you know, Governor Reagan has refused to debate with me. What I think we ought to have and what I know we ought to have, for the benefit of the American people, is a man-to-man debate between me and Governor Reagan, so that I can say to him, ""I\'ve got a question I want to ask. As you put the burden of welfare and education on the shoulders of local property tax payers, how is it going to be paid for by those already overburdened Americans? Or if you\'re going to transfer some sort of tax source to them to finance this program, how is the Federal Government going to handle the enormous deficits and the enormous inflationary results of that transfer?""', ""The point is that in an election year it's extremely important for candidates to be responsible, to be sound, to be clear, to be honest, not to mislead the American people by offering simplistic answers to complicated questions, and if questioned on an issue so important as the one I've just described to you, to explain very clearly to the American people what the answers are."", ""There's a very clear difference between me and my opponent. There's a very clear difference between the Democratic Party and what it stands for and the Republican Party. That difference is much more vivid in 1980 than it's been before. We're talking about a difference in two futures for America. I know that all of you are searching now, during the last few weeks of this election year, for the answers to this basic question: What is the future of our Nation going to be? Will my family be stable? Will my taxes be moderate? Is my future predictable? Are we going to control nuclear weapons? Are we going to avoid war and keep peace for our Nation? Will education and welfare and other programs be handled in a responsible way? Will job opportunities be provided? Will tax programs be fair?"", ""These are the kinds of questions that must be determined in the mind of every single individual American who goes to the polls to vote on November the 4th. The responsibility is yours. And that's why I came here to this fine school to talk to you and to listen to you and to talk to your students and the faculty of this school and to learn how you feel our Nation's future will be shaped."", ""I started out my remarks by saying that this school stands for what America is all about, and I believe it's also what our economic programs are all about. There are no easy answers. The American people want frankness. The American people do not believe in living on handouts. The American people believe that an able-bodied person should have a job and if it's offered to them, that that person ought to take the job. The American people want to carry their own weight. And I want to make it easier for those aspirations and those commitments and those principles that have guided our Nation for so long to be carried out."", ""As I said before, we Americans come from a lot of different countries, and we've all come with the same common dream-a dream of freedom, a dream of opportunity, a dream of a better future for our families. And I'm determined to make this dream of America a living and a breathing reality. With your help, we will not fail. The future of our great country will be even brighter than the present and the past that we free Americans have known."", ""Thank 'you very much. God bless you all.""]"

Chicago Democrats put Illinois in the Democratic column in 1960 and elected John Fitzgerald Kennedy President, and I look for Chicago Democrats and Cook County Democrats to do exactly the same thing for me in 1980. I want you all to remember what Adlai Stevenson said: ""You have to vote like a Democrat if you want to live like a Republican."" Right? And by the way, I\'d like to remind you that in 1952 and in 1956, my State, Georgia, voted for Adlai Stevenson, not Dwight Eisenhower, for President. So, we know how to select them in Georgia, too.', ""Tomorrow I want you to turn out all the unregistered voters in Chicago and Cook County, get them registered to vote, and then turn them out on November the 4th so they can vote Democratic. Tomorrow is the last day for registration, and I want you to work this next 24 hours as though the entire election depended on every voter that you get elected [registered] tomorrow, as if every vote counts this year, because there's no doubt that it does."", ""This is a crucial election.

This is an election between two futures that will affect the life of every person here. It will affect the life of everyone in your family. It will affect the life of everyone you love or care for. Your choice will have an impact on whether this country continues to strive for justice and compassion, whether we build or not for peace in the future, and whether or not we have a solid economy that provides a job for every person who wants to work in this country. That's what the Democrats stand for."", 'I have confidence that you and the people of this Nation will make the right judgment and the right choice on November the 4th, because I know the people of this country, like the people of Chicago, are builders. The same spirit that built the magnificent skyline of this city is building a new future for our Nation.', ""We have already built a new energy base for America. From coast to coast, we're moving forward on this very disturbing new element of American life, and that is OPEC oil, and they're charging us for it at more than twice as much today as they did less than 12 months ago. Our new program is now producing more coal than any year in history, and I'm looking forward to seeing the energy supplies of the world be not OPEC oil but Illinois coal."", ""And based on that energy policy, we're now getting ready to build a new industry society for America. We have the most productive workers on Earth. You and others must have new tools and new factories to remain more productive than any other workers in any nation on Earth."", ""I've seen in recent days new energy facilities, high-technology facilities in so-called Silicone Valley, the most modem textile mills and steel mills in the world, and last week I saw 1981 cars rolling off the American assembly lines—more safe, more durable, just as efficient as any cars on Earth. That shows what American workers can do if given a chance. And in every one of those places I saw the spirit of building something new and something good for this country. I saw the hope for our cities and the working families of America. I could see the future of this country, and it's a good, strong future."", ""This country believes in hard work.

We can make this Nation even greater in the future."", ""There are some people who've given up, who say our Nation is weak, who say our people cannot meet any challenge. And they'll tell you not what they're for, they'll tell you what they're against, or they'll tell you that our hope is a trillion dollar tax reduction for rich people, to put the burdens of inflation on the working families of this country."", ""We've got to know among ourselves that this country is going to job security, health care, care for the elderly, a clean environment, and the last 50 years, under Democratic leadership, has given us a nation that's the strongest on Earth. And it's going to stay that way."", 'And if we forget all that, the Republicans want us to believe that the solutions to our problems are all simple, that major Federal programs that cost billions of dollars should be loaded on the back of local property tax payers, that the Department of Education should be abolished, the Department of Energy should be dismantled, the windfall profits tax should be repealed, and the oil companies unleashed to handle the energy problem. The American people are not simple minded.', ""I meet with average Americans every day, not in the big banks and the country clubs, but on the streets, in the schools, Americans who work on farms and in the factories, and I can tell you and I can tell the Republican Party that Americans are ready to build, not tear down. We're ready to face facts and get on the job of rebuilding our economy from the ground up. They're ready to provide jobs for all able-bodied Americans, ready to protect social security and to help the poor and the weak and the elderly have a life of security and self-respect. That's where the future of this country is. The future is in the commonsense and the good judgment and the building spirit and the compassion and the concern of the American people, and that's exactly the spirit of the Democratic Party."", 'And finally I want to tell you that what happens on November the 4th is going to depend on what you do—what you do the next 24 hours in getting your neighbors and people who will listen to your voice to register to vote and, in the next 4 weeks, think about the future. Think about your family. Think about your jobs. Think about tax being equal. Think about our Nation staying at peace. Think about nuclear arms control. Think about the equality that must exist among all Americans.', ""Remember, 1980 is the year of a great Democratic victory. I want you to remember that we win elections from the precinct up. We defeat Republican candidates, despite all their money, up and down the ticket. But most of all, I want you to be able to tell your children and your grandchildren that you had confidence in yourself, confidence in the Democratic Party, confidence in this Nation, and in 1980 we began to rebuild America. I'll do my part, and what I'd like to ask is this: Will you do your part? [Cheers] We'll win together. We'll whip the Republicans from top to bottom on November the 4th."", 'Thank you very much. God bless you all.']"
47,Jimmy Carter ,"October 09, 1980","['I am glad to be home in the South. Thank you, Jim Sasser—a great Senator, right? [Applause] Thank you very much.', 'Senator Jim Sasser, Congressman Gore, Congressman Ford, Congressman Jones, Congressman Bouquard, Congressman Boner, Speaker Ned McWherter, Lieutenant Governor John Wilder, Mayor John Love, Mayor Easley, Mayor Pyree, and all my good friends in Tennessee:', ""You've got more people than I thought you had in the Tri-City area. Four years ago Tennesseans helped to get me a good job in the city and to keep me in the White House for this last 4 years. You came in second to Georgia in the strength of the vote that I got here in the general election, and I'd like to know if you think you might even beat Georgia in 1980. How about that? [Applause] I'd like to have that job in the city just 4 more years and then come back south to home, because it's hard to know until you've been away a while how strong our feelings are for the South and what it stands for."", ""For generations my people have lived here in the South near Tennessee, in Georgia. We share the same basic commitments to what a great nation means. We have a conviction that a better life must depend on hard work, on a belief in God, on strong families, on farming the land, on giving people the chance for a job, on taking care of those who can't care for themselves. We believe in a strong nation, a nation whose military strength is second to none on Earth. And that's the way we are keeping and will keep the United States of America."", 'We also believe in peace, and we know that our country, as powerful as it is, the most powerful nation on Earth militarily, the most powerful nation on Earth economically, the most powerful and influential nation on Earth politically-can stay that way and keep the peace if the people of this Nation are united in common commitment. The South has never forgotten those very important and enduring values.', 'This year, as you all know, is a very important election year. This year the people will make a judgment, not just between two candidates, not just between two parties, the Democratic and Republican Party, but between two futures. And I would like to ask you in this next 4 weeks to think about what this election will mean to you, to your family, to the people that you love, and to the status of the Nation which we love.', ""A campaign is a good opportunity in a democracy to spell out the specific issues so that our people can make the right judgment on election day, Tuesday after the first Monday in November. It's incumbent on a candidate, each candidate to stick to the issues, to analyze one's own record, what has been said, what has been done, what has been accomplished in the past; also, and secondly, to spell out one's vision for the future, what we have in mind for the months and the years and the generations ahead; and third, to compare one's record and one's plans for the future with the record and the plans for the future of one's opponent. This is not only the right of a candidate, it's the duty of a candidate."", ""We have had to address in the last 4 years many very difficult issues which have no easy answers and which are profoundly important to the people of this Nation. On energy, this has been our most serious domestic threat. Last year alone, the OPEC nations increased the price of oil more in one year than the oil prices had increased since oil was first discovered back in the 1800's. Our Nation has addressed this question courageously, and with the help of the Tennessee delegation, we're making good progress now. This year our country is importing from foreign countries, every day, 2 million barrels of oil less than we did in 1977. That's a great credit to you, to the Congress, and to this administration."", ""This year the United States will have more oil and gas wells drilled than any year in history, and this year—and this may be a surprise to you—our country will produce more coal than any year in the history of our Nation. My hope is that in years ahead on the energy market we will replace OPEC oil with Tennessee coal. It'll be good for the whole world."", ""I might point out to you that the future is bright if we manage our affairs soundly. The OPEC Arab nations all put together only have 6 percent of the world's energy resources. The United States alone has 24 percent of the world's energy reserves. We've made good progress now in this first 3 1/2 years in laying a basis for future progress. But it's important for you to realize that my opponent against whom I'm running on November 4 would change all this. He would reverse the progress that we have made."", 'He says that his energy policy, and I quote, is to repeal the energy legislation that has been passed, to abolish the Department of Energy, and to turn the oil companies loose to manage the energy affairs of this country in the future. That would be a very serious judgment for you to make and for your neighbors to make on November 4.', ""The economy of our country is also very important. We've had shocks, yes, in the last 3 1/2 years with this unwarranted increase in the price of oil. But our country has made steady progress. In this last 3 1/2 years we have had a net increase of 8 1/2 million jobs in the United States. Today, in Tennessee alone, compared to 1977, when I was sworn in as President, 144,000 more people have full-time jobs. Our cities have been put back on their feet. Farmers will have the highest gross income, the highest net income, of any administration in the history of this Nation, and we are increasing agricultural exports far beyond what anyone dreamed would be possible just 4 years ago."", ""We've set world records on agricultural exports in 1977, 1978, 1979, and 1980. This year we'll have the biggest increase in history, $8 billion more in agricultural exports this year than last year, $40 billion in all. The American farmers, in spite of droughts, have a great prospect ahead. This cannot be undone. As a farmer I am determined that American agriculture will continue to be the world's greatest resource for peace and Americas' greatest resource for economic progress, and you can depend on that."", ""I might add about the economy very briefly that now that we have an energy policy in place, it can serve as a foundation for the entire revitalization of the American industrial economy. This is important, because American workers now are the most productive on Earth. But we've not been increasing our productivity enough in recent years. This must be continued."", ""The South suffered many generations from wages that were too low to finance the affairs and the needs of a family. I remember the first proposal for the minimum wage was for 25 cents an hour. The Democrats supported that minimum wage; the Republicans were against it. My first job as a high school senior was for the minimum wage of 40 cents an hour. The Democrats supported that minimum wage; the Republicans were against it. Now we have a sound minimum wage program in our country, and my Republican opponent says that there's been more hardship and suffering brought about by minimum wage than we got from the Great Depression. He also says that unemployment compensation, so vital to a nation when temporary unemployment comes, my opponent said that unemployment compensation is just a free paid vacation for freeloaders. This is the kind of attitude toward working people that's contrary to the basic concepts of the South and contrary to the basic concepts of our Nation. And that's the kind of choice that will be made on November 4 by this Nation."", ""The last point I want to make this morning is about our Nation's defense and about peace. Eight years before I was President, we had Republicans serving in the White House. Seven of those years American Government budget for defense went down—7 out of 8 years, down. Since I've been in office we've had a steady, predictable, deeply committed, orderly, and fruitful increase every year in our Nation's commitment to defense in real dollars above and beyond inflation."", ""We must have a strong defense in order to keep our Nation at peace. We also know that it takes two wings on an airplane for that airplane to fly. You can't just have massive armaments, which we do have, and depend on that to keep our Nation at peace. You've got to have arms control, you've got to have sound relationships with our allies, and you've got to have a steady course and a willingness to settle major differences around the world, which are inevitable, with diplomatic means, and not by American soldiers and sailors and airmen in a time of crisis."", ""This is what we've done. We have worked hard for peace, and we've kept our Nation at peace. I have not ordered a single American soldier into combat in the last 3 1/2 years, and I pray to God that when I go out of office at the end of 4 more years we'll still have a record of peace intact."", ""Every President since Harry Truman has known the extreme importance of controlling nuclear weapons, to negotiate SALT treaties with the Soviet Union so that we could have a balanced, controlled, predictable, known, and reducing level of atomic weapons. It would be a mistake for us to forget the horrible worldwide destruction that could come from abandoning nuclear arms control. Every President has worked on this. I concluded SALT II treaty terms with the Soviet Union following the work that had been done by President Ford and President Nixon. That's crucial to every family, every life in this Nation, and to everyone in the entire world."", 'Just recently my opponent said that he would withdraw SALT II, not ask the Senate to ratify it, that he would launch a nuclear arms race, and play a trump card against the Soviet Union. This would be the end to any fruitful effort to negotiate control of nuclear arms and would be a destabilizing factor in the entire world that would shake the foundations of our alliances and create unwarranted tensions among nations that either have or do not have atomic weapons.', 'In the last few years myself and my predecessors have had to deal with a constant stream of potential crises. If they are handled properly you may not ever know about them. But if a President makes a serious misjudgment, a small crisis can become a major one and can affect every life represented here. Time after time after time my opponent in the last few years has called for the injection of American military forces into diplomatic troubled regions of the world—in Korea, Ecuador, Cuba, the Middle East, Pakistan, Angola. Time after time after time when there was a problem my opponent has said, ""Let\'s send American military forces there to settle the dispute."" Fortunately, Democratic and Republican Presidents have not done that. We\'ve tried to ease those tensions and resolve those differences in a peaceful way, letting the influence of our Nation be strengthened by strong military forces. That is the kind of judgment that American voters will make on November 4.', ""I'd like to close by saying this: America's defense will be kept strong, but the best weapon is the weapon that's never fired in combat, and the best soldier is the soldier that never lays down his life or sheds his blood on the field of battle. That's what sound judgment and proper leadership can do."", ""Let me close by saying we've got less than 4 weeks to go. This is a very close election. Major issues are at stake. I've only outlined two or three of them, but the sharp differences that exist between me and my opponent are perhaps unequaled in the recent political history of this country. Think very seriously about the consequences of your vote and the decision that America will make on November 4."", ""I want a nation strong and at peace. I want a nation where people have a chance for a better life. I want a chance to see Americans at work with a good education. I want to see the Nation united, North and South united, black and white united, rural and urban united. I want to make sure that our Nation moves forward with progress, predictable progress, steady, based on the great resources, human and natural resources that God's given us. That's the vision that I have for our country—a nation strong, confident, hopeful, at peace, filled with respect one for another, using our beneficial impact around the world to enhance human rights."", ""If you'll help me on November 4, we'll have a tremendous victory, we'll whip the Republicans again and keep this Nation on the proper road.Thank you very much. God bless you.This is a beautiful crowd, a wonderful welcome to Tennessee and the South, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. God bless all of you."", 'Go to work now for me, right? [Applause]']"
48,Jimmy Carter ,"October 09, 1980","[""THE PRESIDENT. Jim, I particularly thank you for that wonderful introduction. It's a real pleasure for me to be here. There is no way that I could search the United States of America and find a better Democratic ticket to run with than here in North Carolina, the one you've put together, and I thank you for it."", ""My background, as you know, is the South. And my present is the South, and my future is the South as well, because I've never found any difference between what was best for this region compared to what is best for the entire United States."", 'But in the long time prior to 1976, the South was not given the opportunity to have one of our sons seek the highest office of this land successfully. When I began to campaign in 1976, many of my southern friends said, ""Jimmy, it won\'t be possible because the last President who was a southerner who was elected was James K. Polk in 1844."" But I came to North Carolina and asked you for your help; you gave it to me, and now I\'m in the White House. I\'m going to stay there 4 more years.', 'And I might have a few weaknesses, you know, but—', 'AUDIENCE. [Shouting] No!', 'THE PRESIDENT. Some people say I have. I agree with you, I think. [Laughter] But one of the things that gives me both enthusiasm and also confidence in North Carolina is to be on this same unity campaign with one of the finest, strongest, most distinguished Governors in the United States, Jim Hunt.', ""And I'd like to say just one special word on behalf of a man of great courage. I am the President, sometimes lonely, making in the Oval Office decisions that are not easy, because the questions that come to me can't be solved by you personally or within your own home or in a city hall or a county courthouse or a State legislature or the Governor's office. They're the most difficult questions of all. And for a President, eager for a strong nation, eager for a nation that uses its strength to stay at peace, I'm grateful to you that you let Jim [Bob] Morgan represent you and me and this Nation in the United States Senate-Bob Morgan. Bob Morgan is a great man."", 'Bob is a man who has been under attack, as you know, on your televisions, from outside forces spending hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars against a great North Carolinian. And I hope that you here in North Carolina will show those outside, rich, political, misguided Americans what you think of Bob Morgan.', ""In 1974—I was Governor—I came here to Winston-Salem at the request of a young man running for Congress. A lot of people said he didn't have a chance. I had confidence in him. He has assumed a major leadership role in the House of Representatives. He's grown every year politically in wisdom and judgment and in influence. He truly represents your best interests in our National Capital, and I'm very glad to come back here as President and express to you my pride in Steve Neal, who I hope you will keep there for a long, long time."", ""Well, I'm proud of all of them, but I'm going to be even prouder of the people of North Carolina on November the 4th when you vote the Democratic ticket back in office, from the White House all the way to the courthouse."", ""I think a lot of you know that North Carolina is my second home. My people came from Bertie County, North Carolina, and moved to Georgia. They moved down there about 10 years before the Revolution. They were tobacco farmers, and I think they surely grew some goobers as well. [Laughter] But my ties of kinship and friendship with you are very strong. And for generations I've shared also with you and other southerners certain convictions that are important to working people—a pride, almost a reverence, for hard work; a deep personal belief in God; a commitment to maintain strong families; a belief that we are stewards of a wonderful gift of the land; a belief that these principles are the bedrock of our society. And I pray to God that the people of the South and the people of this Nation will never lose their commitment to these enduring values."", ""I've come back home to the South to ask you to join with me in one of the most crucial campaigns in recent times. This is not just a contest between two men. It's not just a contest between Republicans and Democrats. It's a contest that will spell out for you, for your families, for those you love and for this Nation two different futures. The choice will affect how we respond and how we search for justice and compassion, how we meet the challenge of keeping America strong and using that strength to maintain peace, whether or not we'll have a strong economy, a growing economy, confidence in the future, whether we hold down inflation, whether we have fair taxes, whether we provide jobs for every American able to work and make sure that all those that are able to work will take a job if it's offered to them."", ""I know that America and the people, within 4 weeks from now, on November the 4th, will make the right choice. And I know the people of this country, like the people of North Carolina, are builders. I'd like to say just a word about that—builders."", ""I've seen the South suffer economically. I remember the days when the Congress was passing a minimum wage bill-25 cents an hour was what we wanted to have. The Democrats were supporting that legislation, the Republicans almost down the line were against it. And later, before I finished high school, the minimum wage was raised to 40 cents an hour. That's where I got my first job—40 cents. Democrats were for it; Republicans said that working people weren't worth 40 cents an hour."", 'I remember in the Depression years when Franklin Roosevelt said we need social security to give the elderly people a chance for self-respect and decency and security. Republicans were against it. And I remember in history-I lived on a farm—rural free delivery of mail. The Democrats were for it; the Republicans against it. And I remember the rural electrification program. I think the brightest day of my life, the best day of my life was when electricity got to our house. I was 13 or 14 years old, and the REA came in under Franklin Roosevelt. The Democrats were for it; Republicans were against it.', 'The man I run against represents the Republican Party, and he\'s said that the minimum wage has caused more suffering and hardship than the Great Depression. And I have a heartfelt concern about people that are temporarily out of work, and my opponent, Governor Reagan, says that unemployment compensation is just a paid vacation for freeloaders. This is a man that four times has said, ""Let\'s let social security be voluntary,"" which would mean the end of that program. He\'s campaigned across this Nation against Medicare. It provides a little bit of health care for older people. These are the kinds of issues that are at stake in less than 4 weeks, and the decisions about those economic issues will affect your life.', ""We've now got a good energy base in this country, for the first time an energy policy that's making progress. We're saving energy now, having good conservation in our homes, automobiles, at work. We're producing more American energy. This year we'll dig more American oil and gas wells than any year in history. This year we'll produce more American coal than any year in history. And this day and every day in 1980, we are importing from foreign countries 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the first year I was in office. That's progress, thanks to you."", 'My opponent says, ""Let\'s eliminate the windfall profits tax; let\'s abolish the Department of Energy; and let\'s let the oil companies be unleashed. to run the energy program for us."" That\'s the kind of issue that will be decided on November the 4th.', ""With that energy base in place, we now have a chance to revitalize the American industrial program. We've got the greatest country on Earth economically. The American producers, the workers are the most productive on Earth. We've not been making as good progress in recent years as we ought to to increase production. We've got to have new tools and new factories to do it."", ""In recent days, I've been in some places that show what America can do now that we have an energy program in place. I was in a steelmill in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, a modern steelmill where the workers in that factory produce more steel per year per worker than in any factory on Earth. They're exporting their steel, about half of it, to the People's Republic of China. They can make steel, United States, using scrap metal, ship it halfway around the world, and sell it to China, cheaper than the Japanese can make it and just send it a few hundred miles over to their neighbors in China."", ""Not long ago, I was in the Atlanta airport, a vision of the future, a dynamic demonstration of what the South is now and will be in years to come. Not long ago, I was in a modern textile mill in Spartanburg, South Carolina—typical of what we've got throughout the South."", ""Jim Hunt pointed out that we've increased exports of American textiles to foreign countries for a change—$2 billion in the last 2 years—and at the same time, we have cut imports from foreign countries in textiles to our country. That's the kind of progress I'm talking about now and in the future."", ""One other example: Last week I was in Detroit, Michigan, and Flint, Michigan, and I saw rolling off those assembly lines the best built, best designed, safest, most durable automobiles in the world. And the next time you trade cars, I want you to go to an American dealer, take a look at them, give them a chance, because none can beat the cars we're making in this country now."", ""I've just come from East Tennessee. I'll save time by moving very quickly to Winston-Salem, North Carolina. No one who's come to this State and to this region can doubt that the economic and industrial progress that I've just outlined to you is taking here as well. I know that R. J. Reynolds has just announced a $1 billion plan to expand capacity and to improve productivity."", ""In every one of these places, your community and mine, east and west coast, I see the spirit of building something new and something good for the country that we love. I see the hope for better communities, the hope for working families to live a better life, for young people to enjoy their talents and the use of them even more than we have had a benefit to do in our own generation. I see the future of this country strong and secure and good. Don't let anyone tell you different. Don't let anyone tell you that this country is weak or washed up, that we don't have it in us to make this great country of ours even greater."", ""There are people, and you hear from them every night on television, who've given up on this country. They'll tell you that we have to change our priorities on job safety to let workers be endangered, on health care to abandon our elderly, on aid for schools, on a clean environment. They tell you that our military is second rate. This is one of the worst things you could say about a nation, because it creates in our own people the false sense of concern, and it expresses doubts which lessen the commitment to our alliances by those who depend on us in Europe, and it raises a false expectation among potential adversaries that our Nation might be vulnerable to a possible attack. Our Nation, militarily, is the strongest nation on Earth, and we'll never be second to any other country in military strength."", 'I don\'t want you to forget the important issues at stake. We don\'t want to do away with Medicare. We don\'t want to change and weaken social security. And also, my opponent, to get to agriculture, said that farm price supports, and I quote from him, ""subsidize the inefficient."" The Republican candidate has repeatedly suggested that programs such as welfare, education, mass transit, be turned over to the States and the local governments to pay for. He hasn\'t explained it, but if those suggestions were implemented, the impact would be much higher property taxes, State income taxes, State sales taxes, State business taxes in every part of the country.', ""North Carolina now receives, from your income tax dollars paid to Washington, $910 million a year in Federal aid for those programs. You'd have to raise State and local taxes by 99 percent, almost exactly twice, or $644 for every family of four. That's not my idea of how to help the people of North Carolina."", ""If that's not enough, he also wants a massive election year tax cut for the rich. Under the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, a family making $200,000 a year would get 35 times as much benefits as a family making $20,000 a year. Only 10 percent of this ridiculous tax cut would go for job-producing investment. The rest of it would set off an inflationary whirlwind so severe that even President Ford, who supports Governor Reagan, says he could never support this tax program, and the Republican candidate for Vice President, George Bush, said it sounds like voodoo economics to him and would increase inflation rate over 30 percent."", ""Well, I don't want to make another longer list, but the point I'm trying to make to you is that in national security, economics, human affairs, local and State property taxes, respect for one another-these kinds of things are at stake."", ""The American people are not simpleminded; they've not given up on this country nor its values. I meet average Americans every day, and I can tell you that Americans throughout this country are ready to build again, not tear down. We're ready to continue the program to improve our armed services with the finest, best trained fighting men and women on Earth, remembering that the best weapon is one that's never fired in combat, and the best soldier is the one that never has to give his life or shed his blood on the field of battle."", ""And finally, let me say this: We're also ready to sustain our farm programs. The American farm family wants nothing more than stable agricultural programs with stable prices and orderly marketing. I'm committed to that, including, and especially including, a sound loan support program for tobacco."", 'I know that tobacco farmers are seriously concerned about the treatment of imported tobacco by the Customs Service. I share that concern, particularly over the report that leaf tobacco is being shredded overseas expressly for the purpose of circumventing our United States laws. I intend to see that the loophole that permits this practice is closed once and for all.', ""I'm directing the Department of Agriculture to determine what the quality of this imported tobacco is. And if it's determined, as a result of this information, that the necessary relief cannot be provided promptly under existing law and authority, I will propose to the Congress as soon as they reconvene that they promptly enact legislation granting me that authority. And I want to be sure that Bob Morgan and Steve Neal and the other Congressmen from North Carolina are up there to help me correct this deficiency in our law."", ""Two million farm families in this country, a lot of them in Georgia, depend on the tobacco industry, and I won't ever forget that."", ""Finally, let me say to you that we recognize that to rebuild our economy is important, it's going to take a while, but the Americans have never failed to do what we set to do as a goal. Think back in history. Some of you are even older than I am. You remember the days of the Great Depression. Our Nation was tested. Some of you remember even the First World War. Our Nation, democracy itself, was tested. Many of you remember the Second World War, the Korean war, the divisive Vietnam war that separated one from another among Americans. You remember the disgrace and embarrassment of Watergate. You remember the time when the South was struggling to overcome discrimination and separation of black from white and how we had to go through those tortuous years to change our way of life—one of the best things that ever happened to us. But this is an example of a few things that this country has faced in the past—in the past."", ""Nothing that we face now equals the difficulty or the trial or the tribulation or worry of those experiences. I won't even mention the War Between the States or the Revolutionary War, other times when our Nation's been tested. But you remember this: Whenever our Nation has been tested, with the American people unified we have never failed. We have never failed to answer any question, no matter how difficult. We've never failed to solve any problem, no matter how much effort it took. We've never failed to scale any obstacle, no matter how great. And we have never failed to set an example for the rest of the world. Our country has always been on the cutting edge of progress. We raise high the banner of human rights, freedom, a belief in the average human being, a belief in God, a commitment that our children will have a better life even than the one we have. Those are the kinds of concepts that have made this Nation great, and with your help and with the help of God in the years ahead, we'll make the greatest nation on Earth even greater."", 'Thank you very much. Work hard this next 4 weeks. God bless you.', ""I want the entire Nation to remember farmers and agriculture. And the Congress has passed a proclamation setting aside a special time for this country to pause, to thank God, and to remember what agriculture, what our land, what our stewardship means to this country, now and in the future. And I'm going to sit down at this table on my left now, surrounded by your fine North Carolina leaders, and sign this proclamation into law. And I want to make sure that we never forget we've got a tremendous responsibility to make the Earth clean and productive, to make sure that neighbors respect one another, to make sure we never lose our confidence and our faith and never forget to thank God who gave us all our blessings."", 'Thank you very much.']"

This election is not about who debates whom. The election is not about who's ahead in the polls. The election is not about who says what about the other candidate. The election in less than 3 weeks involves very serious consequences for you, for the people whom you love, and for the people whom you represent."", ""Sometimes we tend to forget how much this election will affect our future. The choice could not be clearer. There is a much more profound difference between me and Governor Reagan that there ever was between me and President Ford just 4 years ago. It's the sharpest possible difference in basic philosophy and commitment in public statements on issues that affect working people."", ""On the one side is a Republican candidate who in 1976 persuaded President Ford to reverse his solemn promise to the working people that he would not veto a common situs bill, and my opponent talked President Ford into vetoing the common situs bill. On the other side, you've got a Democratic administration that has fought for common situs and will go on fighting for it along with you until it's passed into law."", 'On one side is a Republican candidate who says, and I quote, about Davis-Bacon, ""This is a gift of tax funds to the privileged workers."" On the other side is a Democratic administration that has successfully fought off nine different times Republican attempts to repeal Davis-Bacon, and if such a bill ever gets to my desk while you\'ve got a Democratic President in the Oval Office, I will veto it and, you can count on that.', 'On one side you\'ve got a Republican candidate who said to a proposal last year to abolish the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA—his reply was, ""Amen."" On the other side, you\'ve got a Democratic administration that has strengthened OSHA and has focused its activities on the real health and safety problems of the workplace.', 'On one side is a Republican candidate who said this year that labor law reform, and I quote, ""is a bill that should be defeated."" On the other side is a Democratic administration that\'s fought for labor law reform, and we\'ll go on fighting for it, with you, until it\'s passed into law.', 'I remember, as you do, during the Depression years, when Franklin Roosevelt put forward the idea of social security. The Republicans opposed it, but a Democratic Congress and a Democratic President put it into law.', 'I remember back in the Depression years when a Democratic President proposed the minimum wage to eliminate the sweatshops and let working families live a decent life. At that time the minimum wage proposal was 25 cents. The Democrats put it across. The Republicans opposed it. My first job as a young high school graduate, minimum wage was 40 cents—10 hours a day. The Democrats supported it. The Republicans were against it.', 'I\'m running against a man who hasn\'t changed that basic, negative Republican philosophy, because this year he said, and I quote again, ""The minimum wage has caused more misery and more unemployment than anything since the Great Depression."" On the other side you\'ve got a Democratic administration, as you know, that has enacted phased, predictable, automatic increases in the minimum wage that let our lowest paid workers live a decent life now and forever more and not wait 6 years every time to get what they deserve.', 'I know what it means to have temporary unemployment, And I know how devastating it is to a family\'s life when the income is no longer there and the children are still hungry and need clothes, need to go to school. On one side you\'ve got a Republican candidate who has called recipients of unemployment compensation, and I quote again, ""freeloaders wanting a prepaid vacation plan."" On the other side, you\'ve got a Democratic administration now fighting for—and it will succeed in getting—an extension of unemployment compensation insurance for workers in hard-hit industries.', 'The conscience of American labor has always extended beyond even those crucial issues that affect your own members. Let me list very quickly just a few of those issues, because you ought to have these in mind every day, because they concern you, not only as labor leaders but as national leaders representing the best elements of our country.', 'The first is energy. The Republican candidate who fought against the windfall profits tax on the oil companies summed up his energy program this way, and I quote him again, ""What needs to be done is for the Government to repeal the energy legislation. We must abolish the Department of Energy, and then turn the industry, that is, the oil companies loose to make those decisions for us.""', 'This Democratic administration has fought successfully, as you know, for the windfall profits tax, for a massive program for better urban transportation to help develop American energy, to give us aid for poor families to pay their fuel bills, and to reduce our imports more than onethird in the last year alone. Every drop of oil that we do not have to buy from OPEC increases our economic security and our national security. We must not allow our progress on energy to be reversed.', 'The second item, as important perhaps to family life as energy, is health. The Republican candidate against whom I run began his public career as a politician traveling around this country as a leader opposing Medicare. He says now, and I quote, ""I am firmly opposed to national health insurance."" This Democratic President shares with you a commitment to a national health plan and to all the great programs of better social life this country has adopted under Democratic Presidents since Franklin D. Roosevelt.', ""The third issue that affects every one of you is the cities of America. You all know that the Republican candidate used to boast about praying that the Federal Government would never bail out New York City. I'm sure the Lord heard that prayer, but like all of you, I'm glad that after due consideration, the Lord made the right decision— [laughter] —with a little help from those here below who've worked so hard on it."", 'The Republican candidate also said just a few months ago, and I quote him again, ""Urban aid programs are one of the biggest phonies that we have in the system."" There are some people in this room who might give him an argument about that, and I\'m one of them. We Democrats have pushed through the first comprehensive national urban policy in our history, and we stand by our commitment to New York and to all the great cities of America.', ""I'm no newcomer to the object of finishing the decision on Westway. I am absolutely committed to DOT funding of that expressway. I am also committed to having the earliest possible resolution of the permits that you need to get this system expedited."", 'And the last subject I want to mention to you is human rights. The Republican candidate has criticized many times our human rights policy as being against the best interests of the United States. This Democratic President believes the American Government should stand up for American values. The workers of Poland have proven that human rights is a universal longing and a universal goal. As long as I am President we will hold high the banner of human rights.', ""Let me say this: This is a tough race. The polls say that we may be behind. The Republicans are outspending us millions of dollars. Rightwing groups are plowing tens of millions of dollars into the television, radio, newspapers, against Democratic candidates throughout this country. They are not charged against Governor Ronald Reagan's campaign. They're proposing themselves and are posing as friends of working people .as they do every 4 years, before reverting to form once again as soon as the election is over. But even if the Republicans can't win the votes of labor members and working people, they are hoping to discourage it."", 'Governor Reagan\'s labor adviser told the New York Times, talking about you, and I quote again, ""I don\'t want these people,"" he said, ""to vote for Reagan. I don\'t want them to vote. I want them to stay home."" We cannot let them get away with that cynical strategy. Fritz Mondale and I are going to need the help of every one of you and a lot more besides. New York is extremely important in this effort.', ""For the sake of everything we've done in the past, under Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Jack Kennedy, all the Democrats, for the sake of everything we'll do together in the future, let's get our message across to every single working family in New York. We have less than 3 weeks to go. So, let's every one of us buckle down and work together as partners. We need a victory, for myself, for Walter Mondale, for the entire New York Democratic ticket, and most of all, for the beliefs and the convictions and the ideals that we all share."", ""Together we can make the greatest nation on Earth even greater, but let me remind you of this: Coming to this meeting is not enough. Announcing that you are for me and Fritz Mondale is not enough. Sending out a newsletter outlining the devastating effect of Ronald Reagan's election is not enough. What we need the next 3 weeks is workers on the street, in the polling places, in public meetings, letting your voice be heard so that every person in this country that works for a living know the crucial issues at stake."", 'I do not intend to lose this election, and with your help, the Democrats will have a tremendous victory and whip the Republicans on November the 4th.', 'Thank you very much.']"
50,Jimmy Carter ,"October 12, 1980","[""This is President Jimmy Carter, speaking to you from the Oval Office in Washington. I want to talk to you today about our country's future, about the goals I've set for the decade of the 1980's, and how we can achieve these goals together."", ""Too often in political campaigns the focus is on the contest itself, debates about the debates, charges and countercharges among candidates, the endless speculation about who is ahead. Too often the meaning of the election, the real decision facing our country, is lost or forgotten. During the next 3 weeks, candidates owe the American people a clear vision of what we see for our country's future."", ""The choice before this country on November 4th is not just between me and Governor Reagan, it's not just between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party; it's a choice between two vastly different sets of beliefs. The meaning of that choice is not just in what we say, but in the consequences of our words, the consequences of what we believe, the consequences of what we will do. They will be more enduring than any campaign rhetoric. Those consequences will shape the whole philosophy of our society, our country's approach to social responsibility, to economic opportunity, to the quality of our environment, to protection of consumers, to older Americans, to the wellbeing of working men, to the well-being and the opportunities of working women. The choice will affect our security both at home and abroad."", ""So, today and on the next two Sundays I want to describe the consequences of the coming election. Next week I'll discuss the Nation's military security, America's role in the world, and our vital quest for peace. Today I will describe my vision, my hopes, and my plans for our country's economic future. And later this week I will present a more detailed and extensive economic statement."", 'As you know, we and other nations around the world have recently been shocked by OPEC oil prices, which more than doubled in just 12 months. But our country has been strong enough to withstand this blow. The economic outlook after this period of real difficulty has now brightened. We see the beginnings of recovery along with a reduction in inflation. The number of jobs is increasing. Unemployment is declining. Our policies are working. But to stay on the road to full recovery, we need to keep on attacking the roots of our problems—inflation, foreign oil dependence, slow productivity growth.', ""I'm especially concerned about the human impact of these problems—temporary unemployment, the uncertainty of rapid technological change, interest rates too high. I know that some people have questions about earning a good living, providing for a family. I know from personal experience how it felt when my three sons were small. Will I be able to care for my family, to give my children what they need, to provide for their future? These human questions are always on my mind. My heart goes out to families who are threatened or who suffer."", ""Some of our Nation's economic problems are deep-rooted, interrelated, and complex. Solving them cannot be simple. We must face the facts. If we try to stimulate the economy too fast, we may speed up inflation. High inflation triggers high interest rates, which choke off recovery. And we end up back where we started. That's why creating jobs and controlling inflation must go together. That's why I've fought so hard to prevent a massive tax cut this year in the heat of an election campaign, and why I support a targeted tax cut to be enacted next year, focused on the most urgent needs."", 'Inflation is caused by many forces, therefore we are attacking it on many fronts.', ""One is the Federal budget. By slowing the growth of Government spending and by avoiding imprudent tax cuts, we've reduced one source of inflationary pressure. We'll continue this budgetary restraint."", ""Deregulation is another front. We've now acted to free from unnecessary regulation some of our biggest industries—airlines, trucking, energy, banking, railroads—so that the American free enterprise system, with maximum competition, can give us better services with less inflation."", ""But most important of all, we have met head on our country's number one economic challenge, the primary cause of inflation as well as unemployment—excessive dependence on foreign oil. The dimensions of this challenge are staggering. Foreign oil costs our Nation $85 billion a year—$85 billion that could be spent on American industry, American products, American jobs."", ""No country, no matter how strong, can afford to send this kind of money abroad year after year without paying an enormous economic cost. The problem was neglected for too long. Now we have acted. From the very first days of my Presidency, I sought to alert the American people and the Congress to this problem. At first there was doubt and even ridicule, but I kept at it and you responded. We've rallied to meet the energy challenge, as we've met other serious problems in the past."", ""Until recently, most of us never even thought about where our gasoline came from—just from the local service station. We don't think that way any more. We've all come to realize that the service station is at one end of a very precarious supply line. The line is 12,000 miles long, and at the other end is one of the most unstable regions of the world—the Persian Gulf."", ""We've cut our foreign oil consumption by 20 percent in the last year alone, some 1 1/2 million barrels a day. No other country has matched that record. That is extremely important to every American. The war between Iraq and Iran puts this achievement in perspective. Today the United States alone is saving almost half the amount of oil exported before the war by both those countries combined. We've made ourselves and our allies that much less vulnerable to international blackmail or to a break in the world's oil lifeline."", ""We're also building up our own ability to produce energy. This year in the United States, we will drill more oil and gas wells than ever before. We've won approval of the most sweeping program in history to develop solar power, synthetic fuels, to conserve energy, and to create other new energy sources."", 'That program is being financed in large part by a most important and equitable revenue program—the windfall profits tax on the oil companies. This windfall profits tax finally passed this year, after a long and difficult political struggle. It will permit us to take some of the billions of dollars we spend on oil and invest them in creating new American energy sources and new American jobs.', 'Also, we are making rapid strides in coal production. This year we will produce more coal than ever before in history. With better transportation and seaport facilities, we can triple this production. As the major world energy source, I want to see OPEC oil replaced with American coal.', 'We have come a long way in a very short time—in conservation, in production, and in public understanding. Our attack on energy can now serve as a historic first step in a drive to strengthen the other economic foundations of our country.', ""American workers are still the most productive in the world, because we've had the best machinery and equipment, the best plants and factories. But now in some industries that equipment is growing older, and countries that have newer factories are outproducing us. We cannot ask our workers to compete with out-of-date equipment, any more than we would ask our soldiers to fight with obsolete weapons. America will need to spend billions of dollars building new plants and refurbishing old ones."", ""Recently I outlined a broad-ranging program to renew our economic momentum. This program will have some immediate benefits. It will add a halfmillion additional new jobs during the coming year and a million new jobs by the end of 1982. It will also meet our longterm challenges by encouraging greater investment, higher productivity, and reduced inflation. Half of the tax reductions under this program will go for encouraging investment and creating new jobs rather than for encouraging consumption and more inflation. What I'm proposing is the next major step in building a brighter economic future."", ""'Our efforts to meet the energy challenge, our program to modernize American industry can set the stage for an American economic renaissance to propel us past our current economic obstacles and build the new foundations for economic greatness. Let me describe that future."", 'It will be a time of enhanced productivity, with modern plants and equipment to keep American industry at the cutting edge of international progress.', 'I see us turning American coal and shale and American farm products into American fuel for American cars and trucks, and the light of the Sun into heat and electricity for American homes. And I see those buildings and vehicles that will house us and move us in comfort, using a lot less energy.', 'I see modern railbeds and ports making American coal into a powerful rival of OPEC oil, and new industries that bring the convenience of modern communications and futuristic computer technology into millions of American homes and offices and factories.', 'I see an America of full employment, of people working to modernize existing American industry and to create whole new American industries.', 'It will be a time of purer air, cleaner water, and freedom from the threat of toxic wastes.', ""This is not just a dream. It's a practical vision that we can bring to life by taking the right actions today, by investing in our future. This is part of the American character. Our families invest in homes, in education. We parents invest not just in our own future but in the future of our children."", ""I see this kind of progress already in the exciting revitalization of our Nation's urban centers. I've seen it in our ability to produce 8¼ million new jobs in just 3 years, a record never before achieved in any President's term, in times of either 'war or peace."", ""I've seen it in Michigan, where modern, safe, durable, and fuel-efficient cars roll off American production lines, cars that can now compete with any in the world. I've seen it in American steel production, that's beginning to use the most advanced level of technology on Earth. I've seen this progress in our agricultural heartland, with outstanding production setting world export records every year that I've served in this office."", ""There can now be an exciting era of increased prosperity and fruitfulness of our land, built upon the new conservation ethic and technological developments using biomass from growing crops to help meet our energy needs. And I've seen the beginnings of progress in our synthetic fuels production and in our new commitment to basic research and to scientific and technological progress in a broad range of American industries."", ""I'm asking our entire country to drive these programs forward. If we are to succeed, it cannot be because of government alone or business alone or labor alone. It must be because government, business, labor, and the public work together to make this future a certainty for our country. We've seen this partnership at work already in our efforts to assist the automobile industry and the steel industry. It will be further strengthened by the new Economic Revitalization Board."", 'This kind of partnership is at the very heart of America. Almost 40 years ago, in the midst of World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt put it this way: ""The most significant fact in American history is the ability of the American people to face a tough situation and to take orderly and united action in their own behalf—and in behalf of the things in which they believe."" That was true in 1942. It\'s true today. And I\'m determined that it will be true in the future.', ""And I also know that we will achieve this future only if we make the conscious decision to invest in it and plan for it now. A good life in the 1980's and in the 21st century can only be built on American ingenuity, American dedication, American values."", ""The economic challenges which we and the world must face are difficult and complex, extraordinarily complex. But if the proud history of this country teaches us anything, it's this: We can solve even the most difficult and complex problems if we recognize them for what they are and put our minds and our hearts to work on the solutions. History tells us something else, something that illustrates the most basic and important choice before us in 1980: When nations fail to address their challenges realistically and look for simplistic solutions to their problems, then they run into trouble."", 'This is a choice that affects our economy, but it is also a choice that goes to the very heart of our national spirit:', ""Are we mature enough and strong enough to accept the realities of the 1980's and to take the difficult but rewarding steps that are needed, or will we close our eyes and dream of earlier times, simpler problems, and painless solutions?"", 'I have faith in America. I have faith in Americans. We will face up to these challenges. We will work together. We will build for the future, a future of greatness for the country that we love.', 'Thank you very much.']"

It's crucial to our Nation; it's crucial for the leaders of the rest of the world to know where a President of the United States stands on current and major issues. I want the people of Forest Hills and of Queens to know exactly where I stand on these crucial issues. There has been misunderstanding, which is legitimate. There has also been misrepresentation, which is not legitimate."", 'For instance, I saw a political advertisement in one of the community papers. It was placed by an independent committee supporting my Republican opponent and completely misrepresented the policy-past, present, and future—of the United States of America and my administration toward the PLO. Let there be no doubt where I stand. The United States opposes and I oppose any PLO state.', ""The United States of America will never recognize nor negotiate with the PLO as long as it refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist and refuses to accept U.N.

At the next summit meeting of the industrial democracies, among our major allies, we will discuss collectively what can be done to counter such terrorist acts wherever they might occur throughout the world.', ""The world must never forget the lessons of the Holocaust. That is exactly the reason which after all these years I established the Holocaust Commission to plan a memorial in our country, both to look at and to listen to as a constant memory for the victims of Nazi terror. That's also why after 40 years of Government inaction I set up a special unit in the Department of Justice to root out Nazi war criminals who may be in hiding in the United States.

This year's lower rate in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan is of great concern. We will not rest until every Soviet Jew is free to emigrate.

That is a tragedy which, I believe, is the worst of any mining disaster in the United States. And it reminds me, as President of our great country, of the great contribution that you make in providing not only for your needs and your families' needs but also the responsibilities of the operators and the Government to make sure that your working conditions are safe and healthy."", ""My voice today will go not just to this group but, through television, radio, and through the news media, throughout our country and throughout the world, and I particularly want the world to know what I have seen here this afternoon in the brief time that I've had a chance to visit with you."", ""The last time there was a crisis in the Persian Gulf, during the Iranian revolution, the world oil supplies were cut by about 4 million barrels per day. We had long gas lines and fears of worse, as you know. Today, as the war between Iran and Iraq continues, again oil supplies throughout the world have been cut roughly 4 million barrels per day, about the same. But this time our country has been ready. We are ahead of that crisis. And you've not seen any lines, and you've not seen the world brought to its knees by a temporary shortage of oil."", ""For the first time in a century, in history, America now has a national energy policy. It's working, and we're improving our energy security every day. We are showing that this country can produce more and discover more and conserve more energy and that we can use American resources, American knowledge, and American jobs to do it. Nothing illustrates this better than your industry—coal. America indeed is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and my goal as President of the United States is to see on the world energy markets Arab oil replaced with Illinois coal."", ""When I was Governor of Georgia a number of years ago, we made a basic decision, then and before, that our electric power would stick with coal as a major energy resource and not shift to oil and to natural gas. As you know, these two mines connected here where we're standing were originated in their concept basically because of orders from Georgia Power Company. So, I have a special deal with you—right?—as a Georgian, good customer, and also as President."", ""I'm proud that we've been able in my administration, with the help of people like Paul Simon, to do more for the coal industry than any other in the history of our country."", ""Domestic coal production will hit a record high this year. We will produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America, exceeding 800 million tons for the first time. Before this year, you might be interested in knowing, we had never before been able to produce 17 million tons of American coal in any one week. This year we've had 15 weeks in which we've gone over 17 million tons per week. This is the first year in our history in which more than 50 percent of all our Nation's electricity has been produced from coal. Our exports of coal have hit an alltime high."", ""And we're just now ready to take a giant step, which we've not yet taken, that will be another tremendous boost for the coal industry, and that is our Synthetic Fuels Corporation. It will create a massive program for producing liquid and gaseous fuels from coal. We will provide, out of the windfall profits tax on the excess profits of oil companies, $88 billion in the next 10 years. About 75 percent of that will go as loans, loan guarantees, price and market guarantees to the private sector to build synthetic fuel plants using coal to get oil and gas from your coal, which will stimulate the demand for as much as 300 million tons of coal by the end of this century and 150 to 200 million tons of coal during the 1980's."", ""Over the past several weeks, we've signed historic agreements to finance and to guarantee the construction of synthetic facilities, including the SRC-1 in Kentucky, the SRC-2 in West Virginia, and the Great Plains Gasification plant in North Dakota. This year alone, getting ready to do much more in the future, we'll have over $1 billion spent on research and development on better ways to use coal. These demonstration plants, soon to be joined, as you well know, by others, will be among the largest and the best advanced facilities of their type in the entire world and will increase demand for coal by several million tons annually in just a few short years."", ""We're also mining and using coal more safely. We're finding solutions to environmental problems. We cannot afford to waste our natural resources. The American people have to accept coal as both a clean fuel and a safe fuel if we are ever to achieve our goals for energy security and for vastly greater coal use."", ""I'd like to give you a warning while I stand here, one very important. Do not let anyone convince you that the best way to produce and use more American coal is to eliminate air quality standards and water quality standards. That's the best way to turn the American people and the rest of the world against the use of coal."", ""What Sam and I have done together, as your president in both cases, is to try to make sure that all these projected increases in the use of coal are built on a quality environment, because if the American people ever are believing that the use of coal will destroy the quality of air and water, then they will turn against the use of coal. This is not necessary to do that, because we can have pure air, we can have clean water, and meet all these goals that I've just described to you for the rapid increase in the use of coal. With improved railroads, improved highways, improved loading facilities at our ports on the east and west coast and the Gulf area, there's no doubt in my mind that we can triple the production of American coal in the next 15 years."", ""I know that you're concerned sometimes because you hear false and misleading statements about the economic impact of the Clean Air Act. So, I have directed Doug Costle, who heads up EPA, to include a careful analysis of job impact with each proposal for any amendments that might come up when that Clean Air Act is renegotiated and repassed by the Congress next year. I will not propose any amendment to the Clean Air Act without full consideration of its effect on American jobs."", 'The Department of Interior has shown that the coal leasing program can proceed without compromising valuable public lands. The Office of Surface Mining has shown that sound management and reclamation practices can coexist with record production levels. The important goals of a growing and productive economy with jobs for all Americans and a healthy environment for all Americans can be served by careful study, full understanding of the complexities, and close consultation. Those who would dismiss lightly or deny the validity of either concern are simply wrong.', ""I might add here that since I've been in office, the last 2 years, with the help of Sam Church and the producers of coal, we've got a new era of harmony and understanding and consultation and cooperation between the operators and the coal miners. In the past about the only time when there was any conversation between the miners and the owners was when a contract was being renegotiated. Now there's a new spirit of protecting your interests on health, safety, working conditions, and waste levels, but at the same time a recognition that a steady supply of coal, dependable supply of coal is the way we build up customers in this country and overseas."", 'Just as we can no longer afford to waste energy, we can no longer afford to add untreated wastes to the environment. Just as we must conserve energy for ourselves and for our children and grandchildren, so we must conserve the environment. And we can do both, we will do both, at the same time.', ""A balance has also been struck, as I've said earlier, between coal management and labor. I believe that with my own commission, which I established to give me advice on what to do about coal, working with the Members of Congress from coal mining areas, with representatives of the UMW, and also with representatives of those who own and operate coal miles, we've reached a new level of cooperation unparalleled in recent history."", ""I believe that you recognize that coal production is not only good for you and your families, with a sustained income and a healthy life, but also to the economic and the national security of the United States. I've been working to increase coal production for 4 years, and I do not intend to quit until it's at a maximum, until your mines are all producing and America's miners are all working. And I'd appreciate it if you'd help me keep my job for 4 more years, too."", 'Thank you very much. God bless you all.', ""I might add one other thing that I forgot to say because it wasn't on my notes, and that is that later on this month we will have a conference at the White House, between the people that run the railroads, the people that operate the coal loading facilities in our port cities like Norfolk and Philadelphia and Baltimore and others, plus foreign buyers from France and Belgium, from Japan, plus UMW officials, of course, including Sam Church, and owners of the coal mines, to make sure that we plan for the long-range contracts for the delivery of American coal overseas. We are expanding that export opportunity as rapidly as possible, and I believe this bodes well for you and for the best interests of our country."", 'Thank you again for letting me add that postscript. God bless you.']"

So, I feel a close relationship already to the folks of this area. [Laughter] And I've already made a speech out at the coal mine to the workers, who've come up from the bottom, from the shaft, to talk to me and to meet with me."", ""But in this brief time together, I'd like to point out to you that not only does Illinois have the greatest reserve of coal of any State in this Nation but you also, as you know, are number one in the production of corn, number one in the production of soybeans, number two in the production of swine, number one in agricultural exports. My background is a farmer. All of my people have lived in this country for the last two or three hundred years, my family, have been farmers. And when I fly over your beautiful land and see what's happening here in Illinois, I'm doubly proud of what you have to contribute to the well-being of your own families in this country but also to the security of our Nation."", ""A lot of people are concerned because the OPEC oil companies, the Arab oil nations have 6 percent of the world's energy reserves. This country alone has 24 percent, and ours are in a breadth of different kinds of energy resources. But the most valuable resource we have of all is the land that God gave us."", ""We've got a good sound agricultural program. And during my own administration, so far, we've had the highest gross income for farmers; the highest net income for farmers; the highest level of exports in 1977, set world records; 1978, we set new records; 1979, we set additional new world records; and this year we'll export $8 billion more American agricultural products than we did even last year."", ""We interrupted some of the sales of grain to the Soviet Union, but we made sure that we didn't do what the Republicans did when they imposed agricultural embargoes to force down the prices. We imposed grain sale restrictions to protect the security of our Nation and the peace of the world. In the process, we committed ourselves not only to find alternative customers for American grain but to hold up the prices. And if you compare agricultural prices now with what they were in the early part of January, you'll see that we've done very well—sometimes a little slow getting started, I admit that."", ""But in the process, we have now opened up tremendous new permanent buyers for American grain and American agricultural products. This year we will sell to Mexico 10 million tons of American grain. Exports to Mexico in total this year will be three times as great as they were just 4 years ago. And we're now negotiating what we hope will be an eight- or a ninemillion-ton-per-year grain sale to the People's Republic of China. This is a tremendous opportunity for us, to have permanent customers, high quality customers for American grain."", ""I'm very proud of what we have done, but I'm especially proud of the people of Illinois. It means a lot to me to have your support on November the 4th. And if we work together, we Democrats, we'll take the treasures that God's given this Nation, we'll stay good stewards of it, we won't waste the quality of our land, we won't waste the natural resources with which God's blessed us. We'll have a better life for ourselves. We'll rebuild the industrial complex of America to keep American workers the most productive on Earth, which they are now, with new tools, new factories, based upon a new energy policy, a new agricultural policy that'll be stable, predictable, and also profitable for us all."", ""As we have a better life for ourselves, taking advantage of the blessings we've been given, we'll also prepare for a nation with greater security, because we've been living now at the end of a 12,000-mile pipeline half-way around the world to one of the most troubled areas on Earth. With the new energy policy, we have already cut back oil imports from overseas by over 20 percent just compared to this time last year—over 1 1/2 million barrels of oil a day less that we buy from overseas.

There's a tremendous potential among those who've reached retirement age or who are approaching retirement age. It hasn't been long since it was a rare thing for someone to live to be 70 or 80 years old, but in the 1989's that will be the fastest growing part of the American population."", 'If you\'ll pardon my making a personal reference, my own mother, with whom I talked late last night, she said, ""Don\'t interrupt me till the ball games over."" [Laughter] She\'s 82 now. She just recently broke her hip. But she\'s dynamic and vigorous, just as young as she ever was. Each day when she wakes up, it\'s a new opportunity for her to stretch her mind and stretch her heart, to make more friends, to learn more about God\'s world, and to let her life be meaningful to those around her.', ""She's not much different from anyone here.

I remember those depression years. I remember the minimum wage fights in the Congress, when the sweat shops were put in danger by the Democrats and they advocated a 25-cent minimum wage. The Democrats were for it; the Republicans against it. My first job as a high school graduate was when the minimum wage had been raised to 40 cents an hour. That enormous increase from 25 cents to 40 cents was supported and eventually passed by the Democrats; the Republicans were against it. You might say, ""Well that\'s just ancient history. The Republicans have changed."" But do you know what my opponent says about that minimum wage? He said it\'s caused more unemployment and more suffering than anything since the Great Depression.', 'I know how a family feels when they\'re unemployed, when they\'re temporarily out of work and the children need food and clothes, need a way to go to school. Unemployment compensation is a program put into effect by the Democrats; Republicans, of course, were against it. My opponent says that ""Unemployment compensation is just a prepaid vacation for freeloaders."" This kind of philosophy permeates the difference between the Democrats and Republicans; it always has, it does now, and predictably it will in the future.', 'I remember what John F. Kennedy said about senior citizens at an older people\'s meeting at the White House. He said, ""It\'s not enough for a great nation merely to have added new years to life. Our objective must also be to add new life to those years."" That\'s still the objective of the Democratic Party. We must make sure that those opportunities for a better life are realized, because at this moment, in this election the choice will be made.', ""When Medicare was proposed many years ago, obviously by a Democratic President, obviously supported by a Democratic Congress, there was a man who began his political career by going around the United States from one State to another speaking against Medicare. You might guess who that man was. It's the man who's the Republican nominee for President. You might say that's ancient history to be against Medicare, but he has also has come up strongly against national health insurance."", 'As you know, trained by Frank Manning, supported by you, the foremost spokesman for better health care in this country, better mental health care in this country, the humane problems of having better food care in this country for the poor is your own Senator Ted Kennedy. This is the kind of opposition that we Democrats all face together.', 'Social security is the cornerstone of a decent life for older Americans. When Franklin Roosevelt proposed social security, the Republican opposition said this is the same as communism or socialism. Social security has been one of the greatest things that ever happened to our country.', ""And when I came here in 1976 to campaign for President and when I went to all the communities throughout this country to campaign for the highest office in our land, there was a general feeling then that social security was on the way toward bankruptcy. But Father Drinan, Joe Moakley, also Tip O'Neill, Senator Kennedy, all of the Democrats rallied together to put social security back on its feet, to make sure it was a sound program and free of the threat of bankruptcy that had been built up during the previous 8 years, when Republican Presidents occupied the White House. We made that change."", 'But if social security was ever made to be a voluntary program, so that anybody who wanted to could withdraw from it, not contribute to its trust fund any longer, but seek some other private or not have any sort of retirement system, those who depend on social security would have lost their security.', ""We must be sure that we keep in mind the issues that are at stake in just exactly 3 weeks from now. Our country is a great country.

When you look at history, you see a repetition of the political combat that has been in our Nation since it was first founded. My Republican opponent quite often quotes the eloquent words of Franklin D. Roosevelt. On occasion he quotes Harry Truman. On occasion he quotes John Fitzgerald Kennedy. But then a couple of months ago in an interview with Time magazine, he said, and I quote him: ""If you look back, you find that those great social reforms really didn\'t work."" And he continues to say that the compassionate programs of the New Deal were actually based on fascism. Franklin D.

Back in 1960, if 28,000 people had voted differently in Texas and if just a few thousand had voted differently in the State of Illinois, John Fitzgerald Kennedy would never have been President of this great Nation. In 1968 the contest was primarily between Hubert Humphrey, Richard Nixon, and a third candidate named George Wallace. George Wallace took a lot of votes away from the Democratic nominee. The election was very close.

Some of you in this room are as old as I am. I was born in 1924. I grew up on a farm in south Georgia during the Depression years. I remember when Franklin D. Roosevelt put forward the idea of social security. The Democrats passed it over enormous opposition from the Republicans. The Democrats proposed a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour, finally passed it; the Republicans opposed it. I finished high school in 1941. My first job at the minimum wage was 40 cents an hour. The Democrats approved that increase from 25 to 40 cents. The Republicans were against it. That has not changed.', ""As Ted Kennedy just pointed out, Ronald Reagan's attitude toward minimum wage is that the minimum wage has caused more suffering, more unemployment than anything in this country since the Great Depression. He's advocated four different times that social security be made voluntary, that anybody that wants to withdraw from social security and not pay into the social security fund could be allowed to do so. This would be the end of social security."", 'He got his start in politics traveling around this country, paid to do it, to fight Medicare. That hasn\'t changed. Now he says that national health insurance ought to be defeated. He said that labor law reform ought to be defeated, that Davis-Bacon ought to be defeated. They asked him about OSHA, to protect the safety and health of American workers. Somebody said it ought to be abolished; his response, ""Amen."" This is the kind of person representing a party whose principles are well known that now is challenging me and the Democratic Party and its principles to lead this Nation.', 'Unemployment compensation is important to a family temporarily out of work with hungry children, perhaps, and needing to meet the vital necessities of life. Ronald Reagan says that unemployment compensation is a prepaid vacation for freeloaders. In the time of Franklin Roosevelt, in the time of Jack Kennedy, they pointed out to the American working people that for a few weeks before election day, Republicans sounded like Democrats. You know and I know what Ronald Reagan, who quotes Franklin Roosevelt quite often, says about the New Deal. He says the basis for the New Deal was fascism. These kinds of statements have been repeated down through the years, sometimes a little bit of change right before an election time, but they accurately express the principles of his party and of my opponent.', ""This election in New Jersey is extremely close. I don't know yet how it's going to turn out. I'm going to work as hard as I have ever worked, because I believe that major issues are at stake in the country which I love and among the people whom I love."", ""I've been President now for 3 1/2 years. I sit in the same Oval Office where Jack Kennedy sat, Harry Truman, Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, with a heart full of understanding and compassion for working people. The decisions that come to my desk are not the easy ones. If a question can be answered easily, you answer it, yourself or in your own home, or in a county courthouse, or a city hall, or a State legislature, or a Governor's office. If it can't be answered in any of those places because it's too difficult or too complex, it comes to the President's desk, and then he has to sit down with people like Bob Roe, Bill Bradley, Ted Kennedy, and try to work it out for the country. The person in that Oval Office, however, sets the tone and the attitude of government, and as you well know, when the situs picketing bill had been passed by the Congress and Gerald Ford had committed himself to sign it, one man talked him out of it—my Republican opponent for President."", ""Labor is important, working people are important, but that's not all. We need to keep our Nation strong militarily, and we need to keep our Nation at peace. This is also a basic decision which a President must address every day. I have not been in office 1 day that there hasn't been a troublespot somewhere around the world. My predecessors, Democrats and Republicans, have tried to solve those troubled areas of the world peacefully, through diplomatic means, negotiation, using America's tremendous strength, yes, but using it without sending combat troops overseas."", 'My opponent, on many occasions in recent troubled times, has advocated sending American Armed Forces into those troubled areas in times when our country could have been involved militarily-North Korea, Ecuador, Cuba, Cyprus, Rhodesia, Angola, Pakistan, the Middle East. Three times this year he has called for the injection of American military forces into those troubled areas of the world. A sign of strength of a country is when with calm assurance we can protect our national interest without using American military forces.', ""For 8 years before I became President, under two Republican Presidents, 7 of those years our commitment to a strong national defense went down in American budgetary funds—37-percent drop in real dollars. Since I've been in office, we have increased our commitment to defense every year, carefully, methodically, predictably, responsibly. In real dollars we've had an increase. I make no apology for it, because in my judgment we can only keep our Nation strong and at peace together. Our country's the strongest on Earth militarily. We're going to stay that way."", ""But let me close by saying two things. First of all, we've got the most outstanding weapons and the outstanding fighting men and women anywhere. But the best weapon is one that's never fired in combat, and the best soldier is one that never has to lay Iris life down or shed his blood on the field of battle. That is the kind of decision that must be made by a President."", ""I told you earlier, I don't know what New Jersey will do on November 4. There's no way I can predict it accurately, but if you have ever made a major decision in your life, this next 3 weeks you will make one. It's more important than the level of your income. It's more important than the quality of house that you have. It's more important than which college you can send your children. It's more important than the neighborhood where you and your wife might ultimately retire. The future of our country is in your hands, perhaps in this State. There is absolutely no reason why you, working with your speaker and others on every possible occasion in between five and six hundred communities in this State, can't put 25,000 workers out there in the streets, in the stores, talking to people and letting them know how crucial to the future of this country and to your State and to your families this election is."", 'My election can be in your hands, and what you decide the next few hours about the degree of your commitment—to raise money, you finance it; to designate workers, you do it; to lead those workers, you do it. And make sure that everybody in this State that looks to you for leadership understands the crucial issues to be involved-the quality of life of the people that you love and the status in the international community of the country that you love.', ""Those things are at stake. There could not possibly be a sharper difference between myself and. Ronald Reagan and between the Republican Party of 1980 and the Democratic Party of 1980. You know what I believe in, you know what Ted Kennedy believes in, you know what Bill Bradley believes in, you know what John Kennedy believed in, you know what Lyndon Johnson believed in and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. That's the kind of historical perspective and the continuing commitment that is at stake. And you remember very well the times of Richard Nixon and other Republicans who turned their back on the working people of this country."", ""I don't want you to turn your back on the working people of New Jersey or the working people of this Nation. I'll do all I can. I need you as partners. And my question to you is: Will you join with me with an absolute total commitment to see a tremendous Democratic victory on November 4? That's my question. [Applause]""]"
57,Jimmy Carter ,"October 19, 1980","['This is President Jimmy Carter, speaking to you from the Oval Office of the White House.', ""For the past 4 years, the United States has been at peace. We've strengthened the foundations of our security. We have pursued our national interests in a dangerous and often unstable world. And we've done so without recourse to violence and war. This is no accident. It's the result of a careful exercise of the enormous strength of America."", 'Today I want to talk to you about what we must do together in the next 4 years to ensure our own security and to keep the peace.', 'The cornerstone of both security and peace is our ability to defend ourselves. In the last analysis we must be able to meet our commitments and pursue our goals peacefully, with calm assurance and confidence. That requires military strength.', 'We face a potential adversary, the Soviet Union, whose government has funneled much of the wealth and talents of its own people into the construction of a military machine. We would prefer to compete peacefully with Soviet farmers to feed the world, with Soviet textile workers to clothe it, with Soviet doctors to heal it, with Soviet scientists to give it new forms of energy. Those races would be a joy to run. But that is not the challenge they lay before us. Instead, we see a large buildup of Soviet military forces; we see the arming and use of client states such as Cuba; and we see the brutal Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.', 'This long-term challenge demands a steady, resolute response. Historically, our country has moved sharply up and down in its support for defense. After each war we have disarmed and demobilized, and then later embarked on crash buildups. Such erratic actions are always wasteful and sometimes dangerous.', ""My commitment has been different. It's been to provide for a steady rebuilding of our defenses. We've increased our real spending for defense—spending above and beyond inflation—every year since I became President. For 7 of the previous 8 years it had declined sharply, a 35-percent reduction in defense spending between 1969 and 1977. The effects of this long decline cannot be eliminated at a stroke. But we have made an excellent start, especially by putting our technological superiority to work."", ""For example, by producing a number of types of long-range cruise missiles, we can multiply the power of our existing ships and aircraft. We are doing just that. When I took office, we had no new battle tank or modern armored fighting vehicle. Now they are both in production. No answer had been found to the prospective vulnerability of our Minuteman missiles and silos. Now there's an answer—the mobile MX missile."", ""There was no overall plan for strengthening United States and other Allied forces in Europe. Now we have a good plan, and we are putting it into effect. We're deploying antitank missiles at a rate five times faster than the Soviets are deploying their tanks. On NATO's eastern flank, we're working to reintegrate Greece into the NATO command structure, and we attach great importance to this effort."", 'Our purchases of army equipment, jet fighters, and attack aircraft had dropped by some two-thirds in the 8 years before I became President. Since then, we have increased them by 50 percent.', ""When I came into office, I found that we had little capability for quick action in the critical Persian Gulf region. Now we have prepositioned equipment for 12,000 Marines and munitions for 500 aircraft. We've arranged for the use of five different sites in the region. We've deployed two carrier task forces in the Indian Ocean. They give us air and naval superiority to act instantly to keep open the Straits of Hormuz, through which much of the world's oil trade flows."", ""More will have to be done. Even further increases in pay and benefits will be needed to keep trained service men and women in our volunteer forces. Barring some unexpected decrease in Soviet military efforts, we will also need to increase our investments in the ships, aircraft, tanks, and other weapons that are the muscle of our conventional forces. Military forces give us security, but they are not an end in themselves. As I've said many times, the best weapon is one which need never be fired in combat, and the best soldier is the one who never has to shed his blood on the field of battle."", ""Besides our military programs, we've devised something else, what might be called a secret weapon. This weapon will knock out about a fourth of all the Soviet long-range missiles and bombers that we project for 1985. It will eliminate thousands of nuclear bombs and warheads the Russians could otherwise have. It will enhance our intelligence-gathering capabilities to monitor what the Soviet Union is doing. It will do all this without firing a shot, without interfering with a single one of our own planned military improvements, without costing a dime. Indeed, it will save us billions of dollars."", 'This secret weapon, of course, is not a weapon at all. Nor is it a secret. It is SALT II, the strategic arms limitation treaty which we have signed after 7 years of negotiations with the Soviet Union, and which now awaits approval by the Senate.', 'This agreement strengthens our strategic position. It also strengthens peace, for what is at stake is more than a single treaty, however advantageous. What is at stake is a process, an extremely important process, the process of gradually reducing the possibility of nuclear war.', ""Thirty-five years after Hiroshima, the shadow of what was unleashed there still hangs over the world. We've lived with it for so long that we are in danger of becoming casual about it. We must not do that. Even a single hydrogen bomb dropped on a single major city could cause millions of deaths and injuries in the first few seconds and millions more in its wake. It is beyond the power of words to describe the horror of a nuclear holocaust. It would dwarf all the accumulated barbarities and cruelties of mankind's long history put together. More people would die in a few hours than in all the wars of all nations since the dawn of recorded history."", 'Most of us seldom think seriously about the possibility of nuclear war. But as the President of the United States, entrusted with the power to ""unleash that force, charged with the responsibility to bend every effort of mind and heart and will to see to it that it need never be unleashed, then it is something I think about every day and every night of my life.', ""Over the last 20 years we've taken some tentative steps away from the nuclear precipice. Now, for the first time, we are being advised to take steps that may move us toward it."", 'A few days ago my opponent in the current election campaign promised to scrap the nuclear arms treaty we\'ve already signed. He said, and I quote, ""The one card that\'s been missing in these negotiations is the possibility of an arms race."" He also urges that we seek nuclear superiority. His position—and I think I state it accurately—is that by abandoning the current agreement and suggesting an all-out nuclear arms race, we could perhaps frighten the Soviets into negotiating a new agreement on the basis of American nuclear superiority.', ""I've had 4 years of sobering experience in this life-and-death field, and in my considered judgment this would be a very risky gamble. It is most unlikely that it would lead to any new agreement. A much more likely result would be an uncontrolled nuclear arms race and almost certainly a new rupture in Soviet-American relations. The long, slow momentum of arms control would be broken. Any future effort to negotiate arms limits for example, on antisatellite systems, on nuclear weapons tests, on conventional and nuclear arms in Europe—would all be imperiled."", 'The most important duty of a President is to defend the Nation and its vital interests. Part of that duty is to judge what course of action will diminish the possibility of nuclear war. My considered judgment, based on a very thorough knowledge of all the factors involved, is that the course I am following would do that, and that the departure recommended by my opponent would have just the opposite effect.', 'His argument is not with me alone. It is with our allies who, without exception, support both the SALT treaty and the continuing process of nuclear arms control. His position is a departure from the policies of President Truman, President Eisenhower, and all Democratic and Republican Presidents who have served in this office since then. Whatever their other differences, all of them saw a duty to slow the arms race and to bring the terrible weapons of nuclear annihilation under some kind of rational control.', 'I do not propose to turn away from that duty. I propose to lead our country in fulfilling it.', 'Though we must continue to work for arms control, which is in our mutual interest, we must recognize that Soviet-American relations have grown colder in the wake of the invasion of Afghanistan. The world has condemned this act of aggression, and the Soviets are being made to realize that this military occupation of a freedom-loving nation cannot be continued without severe adverse consequences. But we must not let ourselves become obsessed by fear and rivalry. If we do, we run the risk of neglecting the many other problems which are related to the Soviet Union only indirectly or not at all.', ""Peace is the work of many hands. It's the struggle for justice in many dark corners. It is striving to solve problems long stalemated and bitterly disputed. It's having' the courage to rise above old failures and to act upon new. hope. As we raise our shield against war, let us also hear the stricken voice of the homeless refugee, the cry of the hungry child, the weeping of the bereaved widow, the whispered prayer of the political prisoner. We are one with the family of all people, and the concerns to the human family are many. Around the world we've rejected the counsels of pessimism and have dared to make progress toward peace."", ""In the Far East, we've placed our relations with China on an honest and sensible footing. This makes the global balance of power more stable and strengthens peace both in Asia and around the world."", ""In the Middle East, 7 years ago this month, there was war—the fourth Arab-Israeli war in just 25 years. Today Egypt and Israel are at peace, and Israel is more secure from attack than she has ever been. We've recognized the strategic interrelationship between Israel's security and our own. When I first met President Sadat at the White House in April 1977, I told him that I intended to work for a complete peace between his country and Israel—acknowledgement of the right to exist, direct negotiations, open borders, diplomatic recognition, ambassadorial exchange, and mutual trade. He told me that he too longed for that day, but it would never happen in his lifetime. Prime Minister Begin shared his dream and his skepticism. Now that dream has come to pass, in their lifetime and in yours and mine."", ""We have much more work to do. But we have fundamentally changed the situation in the Middle East. The question is no longer Israel's right to exist. The question now is the terms of a broader peace between a strong and secure Israel and her neighbors."", 'A bitter war is now going on in the Persian Gulf, complicating even further our efforts to obtain the release of our hostages in Iran. Think how much more dangerous that new war would be if we did not have peace between Israel and Egypt, by far the most significant military powers in the region. We will continue to consult closely with Israel and with Egypt on strategic matters of mutual interest in our common effort to preserve the peace.', ""In southern Africa 4 years ago, it was clear that time was running out for regimes based on the doctrine of racial supremacy. I'm proud that because we've recognized this fact, we could help with the peaceful settlement that this year brought a democratically elected government to power in Zimbabwe. We've developed excellent relations with Nigeria and other independent nations on the African Continent. There, as elsewhere, we've placed America's influence on the side of human forces that inevitably shape the future."", ""In Central America, a new and more just social order is emerging. We approve that struggle for justice, and at the same time we affirm our faith that economic reform can best be achieved when human rights are respected. I'm convinced that the people of Central America can find their way forward, leaving old injustices, without submitting to new tyrannies. As Americans, we all have reason to be proud of our new relationship with Panama, a relationship that has turned an isthmus of discord into a zone of peace."", ""I've sought to guide us in the spirit of liberty and peace. When we lose touch with that spirit, when we begin to think of our power as an end in itself, when we begin to think that the only source of respect is the threat of force, then we lose the best that is within us."", 'We seek a world in which the rule of law, not the threat of force, is the language of statecraft. We seek a world in which nations put aside the madness of war and nuclear arms races and turn their energies instead to the conquest of our common global enemies—dwindling resources, ecological decay, ignorance, and hunger.', 'No one can guarantee you a future of unvarying success. I certainly do not promise you that. Nor will I tell you that the transition from the troubled world of today to the hoped for world of tomorrow will be an easy one. I promise you only that if you entrust the responsibilities of this office to me for another 4 years, this Nation will have the strength to be secure, and I will continue to find peace by seeking solutions to the real problems, the hard problems. I will do so with both hope and realism, with both determination and restraint.', 'We will keep our Nation strong. But this I can say to you: Peace is my passion. And within the limits of the wisdom and opportunity God grants me, peace is my pledge.']"

It's a pleasure to be back in Beaver Valley. As you know, I've saved the best areas for last in the campaign."", ""I wanted to see again the beautiful land and natural area that God has given to you. In 1978, I held a town meeting not far from here, in Aliquippa, and I wanted to come back to the Valley to talk to you about some of the choices that we face in this election. This is steel country, I know, and I'm glad to be here to talk about steel."", 'As a preliminary, I want to talk to you about another basic industry before I get to steel, and that is coal, because in this entire region, the industrial heartland of our country, these two basic industries are important to every American.', ""Since January of 1977, in Beaver County, we've had an increase in employment, in spite of very serious economic problems, of 7,100—7,100 more people now are employed in your county than there were the day that I was inaugurated President."", ""We still have a long way to go, obviously. We've worked out for the entire country an energy policy that will help us in the future not to be threatened again by OPEC oil price increases. In 1979, the OPEC oil nations increased the price of oil more in 1 year than oil prices had increased since it was first discovered in the 1800's, not very far from here."", ""We have decided to expand coal production, its domestic use, and its export to other countries. So far we have been very successful. This year we will produce more American coal—over 800 million tons—than has ever been produced in any year in the history of our country. This is a good start. What we've done in energy now provides us with a superb base on which to improve the entire American industrial complex."", ""We have a very important and exciting future ahead of us. And we have now brought together management of the steel industry, the steel workers under Lloyd McBride, the president who's here with me this morning, and our Government agencies to revitalize the very basic industry of steel. That's good news to you; it bodes well for the future. We have an exciting number of years ahead of us."", ""As you know, recently the chairman of the board of United States Steel, in this area, made a statement that confirms what I've just said. We've already seen a revitalization of the steel industry commence. In 1981, we'll see a further growth in the use of steel productivity. We've now restored the trigger price mechanism for the basic steel industry, and if it's possible to do so, after we determine that there's injury to the specialty steel industry itself, we will expand the trigger price mechanism or work out equivalently for specialty steel."", ""It's important that this be done. But first we had to reconstitute our approach to basic steel. The revitalization program that will be put into effect next year will give special tax breaks to the steel industry to reinvest back into areas like your own, where the steel management has not done an adequate job in the past. We'll give special depreciation rules to help with reinvestments in the steel industry, and for investment credit, we will let those now be made in cash rather than on credit for future income tax payments."", 'We also have worked out an agreement with the help of management in the steel industry—Lloyd McBride representing the steel workers—and the Environmental Protection Agency to make sure that in the future, environmental protection rules, as we honor the quality of air and water, will have a minimal adverse impact on employment in the steel industry. This is a good agreement, never before worked out between us in this country. We now have found effective, long-term aid for the industries of this area.', ""I'd like to make a few remarks now to remind you of what is at stake in your own life, in the lives of your families, and in your community when you go to the polls to vote on November the 4th. This has been a strong—this is a strong Democratic area, and it shows your sound judgment based on what's best for you."", ""All of you remember, who are old enough, as I am, the Great Depression years of the 1930's and early 1940's. All of you remember when Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed social security. The Democratic Congress worked hard to implement social security. The Republican Party and the Republican Members of Congress opposed social security. The Democrats finally got it passed. That is not just ancient history, because my opponent in this election has several times in recent years called for making participation in social security voluntary. This would mean that anyone, if they chose, could withdraw from making payments to the Social Security Trust Fund. It would mean that social security would very quickly go into bankruptcy and would be out of commission and out of the secure, permanent, sure future that retired Americans deserve."", 'All of you remember during the Great Depression years the argument about the minimum wage. The Democrats proposed the first minimum wage; it was only 25 cents an hour. The Republicans opposed the minimum wage. I graduated from high school in 1941. My first job was 40 cents an hour, 10 hours a day. When we increased from 25 cents to 40 cents an hour the minimum wage, the Democrats were for it; the Republicans were against it. That seems like ancient history, but my opponent in this election, Governor Reagan, says about the minimum wage, and listen to this: ""The minimum wage,"" he said, ""has been the cause of more misery and more unemployment than anything since the Great Depression."" And this year when we had high unemployment in this country, Governor Reagan said, and I quote him again, ""The high unemployment in large measure is due to the minimum wage law.""', 'Democrats have always been interested in working families. Democrats have always been eager to see people who work for a living be given a fair wage. Some of you have been affected, your own families have been affected by unemployment. We\'re working hard to put people back to work. But in the meantime, we must have unemployment compensation. Let me tell you what Governor Reagan said about unemployment compensation, and I quote him again: ""Unemployment compensation,"" he said, ""is just a prepaid vacation for freeloaders.""AUDIENCE. Boo.', ""THE PRESIDENT. Right. That's the kind of attitude that still prevails in the Republican Party."", 'So, when they try to give you misleading statements about what the differences are in this election, you remember ancient history like in the Great Depression years and how Democrats under Franklin Roosevelt, later Harry Truman, later John Kennedy, later Lyndon Johnson, have helped your life. And you remember the unchanging commitment to just the opposite principles expressed by my opponent in this election and by the Republican Party.', 'Finally, let me say a word about perhaps the most important issue that will face your life now and in the future, and that issue is a strong national defense on the one hand, which we all support, and peace on the other. The control of nuclear weapons is one of the most important issues, the important issue, in this election. We have got to have a continuation of the control of atomic weapons. Every President since Harry Truman, Democrat and Republican, has worked to put a balanced control, confirmable limit on nuclear weapons between ourselves and the Soviet Union.', 'My opponent, Governor Reagan, has abandoned that policy. He calls for three things: One is to throw the SALT treaty, which was negotiated under Presidents Nixon, Ford, and myself with the Soviet Union, in the wastebasket; secondly, he calls for playing a trump card of a nuclear arms race against Russia; and third, he calls for nuclear superiority, which sounds good on the face of it but has a very serious defect. What would you think if President Brezhnev made a speech and said that the nuclear arms control treaty—that we have negotiated over a 7-year period-that he was going to throw it in the wastebasket; secondly, that the Soviet Union would now start an arms race and demand not balanced nuclear forces but nuclear superiority for the Soviet Union and would play this as a card against the United States in order to make us, force us, to reach some better agreement?', 'Obviously, we would reject that proposal and, obviously, the Soviet Union will reject that proposal. These issues—social security, minimum wage, unemployment compensation, the protection of the steel industry, the extension of protections of specialty steel, the work that our Nation must continue for nuclear arms control, for a strong defense, and for peace—these are the issues that affect this Nation in the next 2 weeks.', ""I'll do the best I can as a Democratic candidate to care for the issues that are important to you. But the fate of this Nation, as a result of the outcome of the election, is not in my hands. I'll do the best I can, but the fate and the decision to be made on November the 4th is in your hands."", ""You've always shown sound judgment in the past in supporting Democrats who ran for President. Most of the time we've been successful. But I'd like for you to remember just a moment the 1968 campaign when a lot of Democrats were confused by a third candidate, and we did not give Hubert Humphrey the support he needed. The issues had not changed. It was still a fight between Republicans on the one hand, Richard Nixon, and Democrats on the other, Hubert Humphrey. And because a lot of people didn't work the last 2 weeks of the campaign for the principles that were important to their lives, Hubert Humphrey, who would have been a great President, never served in the Oval Office, and he was replaced by Richard Nixon. Let's don't let that happen in 1980. If you help me the next 2 weeks, we'll keep a Democrat in the White House and a better life for all of you."", 'Thank you very much. God bless you. Thank you.']"

Last year we signed a treaty with the Soviet Union as a result of 7 years of negotiations, under two Republican Presidents and myself. Now my opponent, Governor Reagan, has advocated that we scrap this treaty, throw it in a wastebasket, and he calls for a nuclear arms race against the Soviet Union. This is a very serious matter of great concern to all Americans. It's important for us to prevent other nations from having atomic weapons who do not now have them. Governor Reagan's response to that is that nonproliferation is none of our business. This is a very dangerous attitude for a President to take."", ""We have, in this country, a real commitment in the Democratic Party for working families of this Nation. The Democrats are the ones who gave us minimum wage. My opponent, Governor Reagan, says that minimum wage has caused us more misery and more unemployment than anything since the Great Depression.

Your success in pulling all these elements into one of the most significant rehabilitation efforts in this country or, indeed, the world would have made Robert Kennedy very proud. Together, you've helped build a lasting monument to him and to his dream of an America, which his brothers shared, with a decent life for everyone."", ""That dream has not yet been realized. It's still in the future, but we are moving toward it. And I'm proud that in this community, my administration has been able to help in some way to give better critical health services, young people more skills to do better jobs, provide thousands of new units of subsidized housing, eight new buildings for senior citizens, and to work very closely for you and with you in making plans for a better future."", ""Because we've come so far, you know how far we still have to go. We've created more jobs in the last 3 1/2 years than any other administration in history—in time of war or peace—l.3 million of the 8 1/2 million new jobs in this country are held by black Americans, and I'm very proud of that."", ""But that's still not enough, and now we have as my most important domestic proposal in the Congress in 1980 the youth bill, to provide 600,000 more jobs for disadvantaged young people with an expenditure of an additional $2 billion in the next 2 years. We've got it through the House already with the help of Charlie Rangle and Shirley Chisholm, and I don't have any doubt that we're going to get it through the Senate before 1980 is over, with the help of Senator Kennedy."", ""In addition, it's time, now that we have an energy program in stock, to make plans for revitalizing America's industry and giving American workers new tools, new factories. It's also time to take advantage of how we can build a better social and economic life, with equality for Americans still not realized by millions of our people."", ""I know, after talking with Governor Hugh Carey, who's with us today, and Charlie Rangel, that we must do something about the drug program in this community and up and down this coast. I wanted to announce at this moment that we have now completed plans on a major, concentrated effort, involving millions of dollars, already available to us in five northeastern cities—New York City, Newark, Baltimore, Washington, and Philadelphia. This will involve treatment of those suffering from drug addiction, intradiction to stop drugs coming in here from the Middle East—from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, through Turkey, and others—and also the prosecution of those guilty of distributing drugs. We need to put them in jail and keep them there."", ""These kinds of programs are typical of what Democratic Presidents have done for the disadvantaged and the afflicted people of this Nation in your lifetime and in mine. Think back in your own minds about the difference in your life, in your family's life, in the lives of those you love when people like Franklin Roosevelt were in office, or Harry Truman or John Kennedy or Lyndon Johnson, and then think about the difference when Republicans occupied the Oval Office."", 'Some of you are old enough, like I am, to remember the Great Depression years, when the Democrats put forward social security. The Republicans were against it. The Democrats put forward a 25-cent-an-hour minimum wage. The Republicans were against it. Later we proposed Medicare—the Democrats did.', 'My present opponent got his start in politics traveling around this Nation opposing Medicare, better health care for senior citizens. We believe in rebuilding our central cities, but my Republican opponent said that he prayed day and night that the Federal Government would never bail out New York City, and just recently, he has said urban aid programs are one of the biggest phonies we have in the system. He said about minimum wage, ""The minimum wage has caused more misery,"" he said, ""and more unemployment than anything since the Great Depression.""', 'Unemployment compensation is important to a family that loses its source of income. Democrats\' hearts have gone out to families who were in need. The Republican candidate says, ""Unemployment compensation is a prepaid vacation for freeloaders."" We believe in Medicare and social security. Senator Kennedy has been in the forefront, as you well know, for national health insurance, and I join him in that goal. But my Republican opponent says, and I quote again, ""I am firmly opposed,"" he says, ""to national health insurance.""', 'In 1964, he called the Civil Rights Act, and I quote him again, ""bad legislation."" A few months before elections, Republicans try to change their spots. They put on a different cloak, and they start pretending they are for people who are aged and who need social security, or sick and need Medicare, or working and need the minimum wage, or unemployed and need unemployment compensation, or needing to have their health care insured and have been against health care.', 'But recently, when he was asked about his basic attitudes after changing all his positions, he said, ""I\'m still where I was over the past 20 years."" [Laughter] And I predict to you that after November the 4th, he\'ll be right back where he\'s been the last 20 years—in Hollywood as a movie actor. But he\'ll be there only if you remember history and you recall what happens to those you love if you take the outcome of an election for granted or depend on the candidate and his public friends to do the work without your help.', 'You know how hard black and white leaders both worked to give black citizens of this Nation a right to vote. And you also remember in history what has happened when Democrats, who were supposed to be loyal to our party, sat back because of confusion or timidity and did not vote or did not work. One of the most vivid memories in my mind is 1968. The Republicans nominated Richard Nixon for President. The Democrats nominated Hubert Humphrey for President. Many people, as you well remember, had been for Senator Gene McCarthy, and when Hubert Humphrey got the nomination to replace Lyndon Johnson as President, a lot of Democrats said, ""Hubert Humphrey\'s not perfect. I\'m not going to help him. Let him shift for himself."" So Hubert Humphrey never went to serve in the Oval Office; Richard Nixon did. [Laughter] It was not the fault of the Republicans who supported Richard Nixon. That was their duty, that\'s what we expected them to do. The fault lay in Democrats who forgot what the issues were.', 'Domestic issues are crucial to us, but that\'s not the sum total of our national character. When I came into office, the national policy of our Government was to stay away from Africa. Henry Kissinger wasn\'t even permitted to visit Nigeria. We were propping up the white government of Rhodesia. But I turned to a great black leader, Andy Young, and I said, ""Andy, we\'re no longer just a nation with the big four to deal with. We\'ve got 150 nations on Earth to deal with, and although ours is a great country with a great soul, a lot of people don\'t know about it because we\'ve put on a different face outside the border of our land."" And Andy Young and now Don McHenry have the trust of people who are yellow and brown and black throughout the world. And we stood staunch in spite of tremendous political pressure against the retention of the white supremacy government in Rhodesia, and now we\'ve got a democracy in Zimbabwe with a freely elected black Prime Minister.', 'Well, I don\'t claim that our Government is perfect. I don\'t claim that my administration is perfect. But you see my friends behind me on this platform. You know our record so far. You know that\' I\'ve said many times, I would never have been given a chance to be elected President had it not been for Martin Luther King, Jr., and others. And many times in my own church at home we\'ve sung the old hymn, ""There is a Balm in Gilead; sometimes we get discouraged and think our work\'s in vain."" But I tell you that together, as Democrats, we have moved forward. We\'re on the right road. We\'re making good progress.', ""In her statement endorsing me, Shirley Chisholm began by saying she'd made her decision based on the realities of this campaign and the state of the country at this time. And then she noted we'd not accomplished everything we'd set out to do, but that we'd only set goals on some things, but that we had also proposed specific, workable ways to reach those goals. And she pointed out that some of those goals had not yet been reached because the Congress has not yet been willing to accept them. But we'll continue to press forward the next 4 years. We've come a long way. We are not finished yet."", ""I'm from the Deep South, and I have seen the need to have the permanent voice of distinguished, idealistic, competent, dedicated black leaders to carry on what I believe in after I've finished my term in office. So in this first 3 1/2 years-I haven't been President long yet—I've been able to nominate, and Senator Kennedy as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee has been able to get confirmed, twice as many black judges in the Federal district courts as all the Presidents put together in the last 200 years. And we're not through yet. And we haven't lowered the standards. Every one of those nominees has been a source of pride to me and to the Nation."", ""This church can prove that it makes a difference to be involved, that despite difficulties that face us, you can make a difference—in the education of your children, in the lives of senior citizens, in better houses, better blocks, better communities. The civil rights movement succeeded because thousands of people felt that they could make a difference, if they kept on until the laws of our Nation were changed, the customs of our Nation were changed. It hadn't been changed for more than a hundred years since slavery was officially eliminated from this land. Those discriminatory laws and practices fell before the marching feet of courageous, dedicated people who knew they could make a difference. You did what you could and persuaded others to join you."", 'In just 2 weeks, Americans must make a choice about our future. In the past, too many have stayed at home, convinced that their vote would not make a difference. I mentioned 1968 when we lost, but in 1960, if 28,000 people in Texas had voted a different way and a few in Illinois had voted a different way, then John Fitzgerald Kennedy would never have been President of this country.', ""The ones who make the decision on election day are often the ones who do not work and who do not vote. It's not enough to have rights; we must use them. The next years can be a time of great progress, a time when we move past all the old prejudices and all the old past indifference, when we put our people to work—all our people to work, building a better America, economically strong, but also strong in our faith in each other, strong in our commitment to freedom, to justice, to opportunity."", ""So, I'd like to ask you, like Shirley Chisholm, to look at the realities of this campaign and the state of our Nation at this date and then come out and vote and help us keep our lives on the right road."", 'The last in what was to be his final campaign, the Presidential primary in California in 1968, Senator Robert Kennedy made a speech at Fisherman\'s Wharf, and in closing he said, and I quote him, ""I ask you to recognize the hard and difficult road ahead to a better America, and I ask you to vote for yourselves."" ""The people,"" he said, ""must decide this election and they must decide so that no leader in America has any doubt about what the people want."" ""For your sake and for the sake of your children vote for yourselves tomorrow,"" he said.', 'I would ask of you the exact same thing. Keep us on the road to a better America. On November the 4th, vote for your children. Vote for yourselves.', 'Thank you very much, and God bless you.']"

As a matter of fact, that partnership is so close that I have to guard the other cities' interests, as Moon and your own Mayor Morial plan for the future. So, Moon, be nice to the other cities. Keep what you want for New Orleans. Let the rest of them have a chance. What bothers me is that Russell Long gives him advice on what to do.

She has the special qualities of a southern woman—beautiful, strong, idealistic, deeply committed-which all of us admire. And I first fell for her, I have to say, when she managed the 1976 Democratic Convention so well and chose the same nominee that I was supporting myself."", ""And I'm also very proud to have as my Louisiana State chairman a man who led this State with good humor, with courage, with confidence, with the utmost in fashion in clothes, with a certain debonair attitude, and who came out of office with the highest support, I guess, that any Governor ever left office with. And also, I'm very proud to have him supporting me. I would much rather have Edwin Edwards leading my campaign than to be in Governor Reagan's shoes with the Republican Governor leading his. That gives me great confidence in the future."", ""So, I don't want the people of Louisiana to let me down. I don't want the people of Louisiana to let Fritz Mondale down, and I don't want the people of Louisiana to let Governor Edwin Edwards down either."", ""We've got some good people in our Cabinet from Louisiana, in addition to Moon Landrieu. Ray Marshall, as you know, is from Oak Grove, Louisiana. Jack Watson, my Chief of Staff, is from Shreveport, Louisiana. And I'm very grateful to come down here on this same historic site that I believe turned the tide not only in Louisiana in 1976 in the general election, but also gave the Nation a new belief which just narrowly came to pass, that I could be elected President of the United States."", ""As Lindy Boggs pointed out, Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson are the two founders of the Democratic Party. Thomas Jefferson did a lot of great things, but the Louisiana Purchase is by far the wisest decision that he or any other President ever made. And I'm very glad that you mentioned Aridy Jackson, too, who fought the British here, in Louisiana, in New Orleans, and beat them so bad that no foreign invader has ever dared come to this place since then, unless you might call Admiral Farragut and Ben Butler invaders from a foreign country."", ""But now that we've got our Nation all back together, we southerners know that although no southern President has served, from the Deep South, since 1844 when James Polk was elected, we're going to keep the hands on the reins in Washington, with southerners who brought our Nation together in a unified way and have a better future for us all."", ""When I came here in 1976, I made a few promises to you. First of all, I promised that the extremely high unemployment rate that prevailed in many parts of our land would be brought down. We've added in the last 4 years 8 1/2 million new jobs in this country, a record never before achieved by any President who's served in the White House in time of peace or war."", ""We promised, also, the elderly citizens of New Orleans, of Louisiana, and this country, that we would make sure that the prospective bankruptcy of the social security system was corrected. And with the help of Russell Long, Bennett Johnston, Gillis Long, and other members of your delegation, we have now got social security back on a sound basis, and we're going to keep it that way as long as a Democrat serves in the White House."", ""At the urging then of Bennett Johnston and Russell Long—they told me to mention that we were going to get a north. south highway started. I didn't know what I was talking about, but I promised it, and the 1-49 connector is now underway to being a reality. And let me point out to you that this list of things would not be complete in Louisiana if I didn't say that I promised also to pass a law through Congress, if they would cooperate, to decontrol the prices of oil and natural gas."", ""We moved too fast for some; we didn't move fast enough for others. But that new law had never been passable since the days of Harry Truman, under Democrats or Republicans. And now we're seeing rich dividends, because this year in the United States of America, we'll have more oil wells, more gas wells drilled than any year in the history of this land."", ""And I might also point it out to you-and it affects your community very deeply—and this may be a surprise: The United States of America will produce more coal in 1980 than any other year in history. And the only thing that keeps us from tripling coal production is that we don't have the port facilities and the transportation facilities to load American coal to replace OPEC oil on the energy markets of the world. I see a real need to improve the channels and to improve the loading facilities in great ports like New Orleans, which will let you be one of the coal shipping centers of this land."", ""I might point out that for Louisiana farmers and for others around this land we set world records in grain exports in 1977. We set new world records in 1978. We set new world records in 1979. And in 1980, in spite of restraints on shipments of grain to the Soviet Union, with new markets in China, Mexico, and other places, we'll have $40 billion of American agricultural exports going overseas—a lot of it through New Orleans. This is $8 billion more than last year; a new world's record and the biggest increase in any year in the history of our country."", ""And now, I'd like to close my remarks by saying just a few things about what are involved in your decisions to be made on November the 4th."", ""I grew up, like many of you, during the Great Depression. I lived on a farm in south Georgia. My father and his father and others before him had never had a chance to finish high school. We didn't have electricity on our farm; we didn't have running water inside the house. And we turned to Franklin Roosevelt and to other great Democratic leaders to help us have a better life."", 'Franklin Roosevelt proposed the REA; the Republicans opposed it. Franklin Roosevelt and the Democrats proposed that our senior citizens would have social security; the Republicans opposed it. Many people were working in sweatshops, little children 9, 10 years old, boys and girls working in sweatshops all day. The Democrats proposed a minimum wage to give working people in this Nation a chance to live a decent life, to meet the needs of their family, and to have some self-dignity—25 cents an hour. The Republicans opposed it.', 'My first job when I finished high school in 1941 was at the minimum wage. It had been increased by the Democrats from 25 cents to 40 cents an hour. The Republicans opposed that increase. This is the kind of record that was set during those years when I was a young man growing up.', 'Later, Harry Truman said we ought to have Medicare to give older people a chance for some health insurance when they reached their retirement age. The Republicans, of course, opposed it. My opponent in this election got started with his public career campaigning around this Nation against Medicare. He has said that the minimum wage has caused more misery and more unemployment than anything since the Great Depression. And he has said unemployment compensation for families who are temporarily out of work is just a prepaid vacation for freeloaders.', ""The differences that historically have been the case between Democrats and Republicans to give the poor, the elderly, the children, the sick, the working families, the farmers a better chance in life—those differences between our two parties still prevail. Major issues are at stake on November the 4th. Those decisions cannot be made by candidates. I'll be working day and night, political leaders on this stage will be helping me, but the issue is in your hands."", ""There is no way that Republican voters can carry New Orleans or Louisiana on November the 4th. The only possibility for a Republican victory here is a Democratic Party that's divided, which we do not have—it's united now—and [if] Democrats who believe that their families and themselves and those they love ought to have a surer, more secure, more peaceful, more prosperous life in the future, don't work between now and November the 4th and get your friends and neighbors to go out and vote."", ""If you will help me, if you will dedicate yourselves to the principles that have made our party and our Nation strong, if you'll remember the heritage of Louisiana and what's given you a better life and will give your children an even better life, then there's no doubt in my mind that with your help, as partners, we will have a tremendous victory, we'll keep a Democrat, Jimmy Carter, with your help, in the White House for the next 4 years.Thank you very much.

From the moment that I took office as President and as Commander in Chief of our military forces, I set two vital goals.', ""'One was reversing the decline in our military strength that had occurred the 8 years before I became President. Seven of those years we had gone down in budgeting funds for the military forces of our country. Since then, we've had a steady, annual, carefully planned, and effective increase above and beyond the inflation rate in the allotment of United States Government budget money for a stronger defense."", ""The other thing that I decided to do as President was to make sure that we corrected an equal threat to our national security by reducing our dependence on foreign oil. Military security and energy security are both vital to our national security. I fought long and hard for the first comprehensive energy policy that this country's ever had. We've won a great victory, a victory that had eluded other Presidents before me, both Democrats and Republicans."", ""We're at the end of a 12,000-mile supply line, a very uncertain supply line. At the other end is danger, turmoil, uncertainty, sometimes the desire to bring this Nation to its knees. As you remember, the last time there was a crisis in the Persian Gulf, with the Iranian revolution, we lost about 4 million barrels of oil per day. America was thrown into confusion. It was a severe damage to our economic security. Long waiting lines at gas stations took place."", 'This time, with a new energy policy now in the law books of our Nation, when the war between Iran and Iraq took place and we lost another 4 million barrels of oil per day, our Nation was able to withstand that shock without any damage to the quality of life or the security or confidence of the American people.', 'The reason for that, of course, is complicated. But a large part of the credit belongs to you and other Americans around this country who recognized that the only way to reduce our excessive dependence on foreign oil is two things: One is to conserve energy, not to waste it; and the other one is to produce more American energy here at home.', ""The OPEC oil nations have 6 percent of the world's energy reserve—6. The United States by itself has 24 percent. But in the past, the oil and gas industry was hamstrung by excessive Government regulation. We were successful finally under this administration, working with a Democratic Congress, to pass the laws deregulating the production and a phased deregulation of the pricing of natural gas and oil from this country."", 'Last night, I got some figures that showed how successful we have been. Now the number of drilling rigs operating in the United States, many of them made by you right here, was at an all-time high-3,164 drill rigs running now in the country, a record never before achieved in this country. Also, the number of oil and gas wells to be drilled in 1980 will be the highest number in the history of our country.', ""This is part of the achievement of which we are so proud, but in matters that don't relate directly to you, but affect your lives, we're doing equally well. Our country—this may be a surprise—is producing more American coal this year, from the coal mines, than any year in history. And we can export as much coal to eager foreign buyers as we can pass through the waterways, railroads, and over the highways, and load on ships. In Hampton Roads, Virginia, at this moment, ships are waiting 25 days to come alongside the pier to pick up American coal."", 'This is the kind of progress of which we Democrats and we Americans can be truly proud. As you also know, this is a step forward in a better life for you.', ""I came into office in January of 1977. Since then, the number of jobs available in Texas, the number of people that work in Texas have increased over 900,000. The per capita income of Texans on the average has gone up more than 40 percent, and the unemployment rate has been slashed enormously in your State. There's a new recognition that on the agricultural farms, among farm families, in exports of American products, we're making good progress now."", ""And with the new energy policy now in place, we can revitalize American industry in the years ahead. The American worker is the most productive worker in the world, but lately that productivity per worker has not been going up as rapidly as it ought to be. It's been about steady. Other countries are going up. But we need to give the American workers new plants, new machinery, new tools, to be sure we're never second to the workers in any country. We're making good progress now, and with a sound economy, a good, level-headed administration to make sure that tax programs and laws on the books are effective, we can have that kind of future ahead of us."", ""I'm from the Deep South, from Georgia. My philosophy in government is probably about the same as yours. I don't believe that government ought to stick its nose in the affairs of private citizens, and I don't believe that government ought to stick its nose in the minds and hearts and jobs of people in the private enterprise system. A lot of people talk about that, for a long time, ever since I remember anything about politics, but nobody's been able to do anything until the last 3¼ years."", ""We have now not only deregulated oil and gas, we've also deregulated the United States railroads, trucking, airlines, financial institutions.

You may remember 3 years ago, every time you picked up a newspaper there were headlines about wildcat strikes in the coal mines.

Doing the same thing in steel—it\'s helped Bethlehem Steel and its corporate structure as much as anything in the past has done. We can meet foreign competition.', ""Not long ago, I was in a little steel plant in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, a modern plant. They use scrap steel that used to be sent overseas. Now it's produced in the United States into steel rods. Every worker in that plant produces more steel per year than in any other steel plant in the world. And I ask them where their product goes. Like yours, it's an international market. They said half the steel produced in that plant goes to the People's Republic of China. They're making steel in New Jersey, shipping it halfway around the world, 12,000 miles, and selling it to China cheaper than Japan, right across an inland waterway, can make it and sell it in competition. That's the kind of thing that we're trying to do all over this Nation."", ""And finally, I'd like to say this to you. This election of 1980 is important to you and to your families, to the people that you care about, and to the true opportunities for future years that mean so much to individual human beings in this country."", 'My background is a lot like yours. I grew up on a farm in south Georgia. My people have lived in this country for a long time. Nobody in my family before me—my father, my grandfather, or anyone else—had ever had a chance to finish high school until I came along. I remember the Great Depression years, when people were starving and a lot of people were hungry. The elderly had no security. And then the Democrats came along, under Franklin Roosevelt, later followed by Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, John Kennedy, gave us a better life. This was a very important thing for us.', ""I remember when they didn't have a minimum wage. The Democrats said at least we ought to pay American workers and their families 25 cents an hour. The Democrats were for it; Republicans were against it. I'm older than most of you, but I got my first job in 1941 when I finished high school. The minimum wage then was 40 cents. When it was raised from 25 to 40 cents, the Democrats pushed it through Congress; Republicans, of course, were against it. It's been a steady pattern ever since and the same issues being drawn in this election, when my opponent says the minimum wage has caused more misery and unemployment since anything since the Great Depression."", 'I know that some of you, on occasion, are unemployed, maybe not at this particular plant, but some of those that you care about, working people of our country. The Democrats have put into effect unemployment compensation to tide you over, so your wives and children can have something to eat, send your kids to school, during those times when plants changed locations or when models changed in automobiles. My Republican opponent says that unemployment compensation is a prepaid vacation for freeloaders.', ""There's always been a difference in the way Democrats look toward people and Republicans look toward people. I remember when old folks had to live in poor folks homes. The Democrats put forward social security; Republicans, of course, were against it."", ""My opponent started his career in politics speaking around this country, paid by the American Medical Association, against Medicare. It just gives some medical care for retired people. He's against national health insurance, of course. And he believes that the same structure that's always characterized the Republican Party ought to be kept intact. You all know that these issues don't change."", 'When Lyndon Johnson ran for President, he gave the working people of this country a better life, gave minority people a better life, gave older people a better life, provided better education for your children, a better chance for you to organize, to present your case to management and negotiate a settlement that would give working families a better quality of existence in the greatest land on Earth.', ""Finally, let me say this. I'm indebted to you. What you do for this country, you can afford to be proud of it, because you contribute as much to our national security as anyone I know."", ""There's a bright future for this country, a secure America, America that's strong militarily, America at peace, an America where nuclear weapons are controlled and where we don't let other nations that don't have them now build them and threaten others against them with terrorist acts. Governor Reagan says that nonproliferation is none of our business. It is our business. You think for a few moments about what it would mean if Libya or Iraq had atomic bombs. The threat of terrorism is enormous. And those are the kinds of issues that will affect your life, your safety, and the quality of existence of those you love in the years ahead."", ""I come here as a President, yes. I come here as Commander in Chief of military forces of this country, yes. I also come here as a candidate running for reelection. I ask you to help me. It'll mean a lot to me. I think it'll mean a lot to the country, a lot to the future. I don't claim to know all the answers. Like yourselves, sometimes I make mistakes. But there's a tide of history that I've tried to point out to you in just the few minutes we've had together."", 'It\'s been an exciting thing for me to come here. I want people all over this Nation, through the television cameras and otherwise, to see what you\'re doing, because it\'s a reassuring thing. It means that all Americans, no matter where they might live, in Iowa, in California, in Georgia, in Maine, can say, ""Well, those folks down in Beaumont, Texas, are producing a product that will go all over the world. It\'ll give us a better life, a more secure life, a better future."" That\'s what I want. With God\'s help, we\'ll have it together.Thank you very much.']"
64,Jimmy Carter ,"October 22, 1980","[""Thank you very much, Lloyd Bentsen, for your introduction. Lloyd Bentsen is the man that asked me to work with him to eliminate the tax on the small royalty owners of Texas and Oklahoma and Louisiana, and I agreed to do it. We're going to do it when the Congress reconvenes. That's the kind of leadership you've got in Washington, Lloyd Bentsen."", ""And I'm also glad to be with Congressman Marvin Leath, one of the finest new Members of Congress, with Charlie Wilson, who was with me earlier in Beaumont, Senator David Pryor, and others that I won't name this morning. But I particularly want to mention Congressman Bob Poage, who represented the people of this district for 42 years and who also represented the people of the Third District of Georgia, where I live, because he knew what farm families needed, he knew what Americans needed—a strong defense, unity among the oil people, and a bright vision of the future. That's what Bob Poage gave us when he was in the Congress, and that's what he still gives us this day."", ""And I also want to be sure to point out to you the great honor always paid to me when I can be in the same congregation, the same audience, on the same platform with Lady Bird Johnson, one of the finest people who ever lived on Earth. I know that I'm not only in the geographic heart of Texas; I'm also in the Democratic heart of Texas, right? [Applause] You might say I came here for the purpose of getting votes for the Presidency, and that's partially true, but this is also the biggest airport close to one of my favorite towns in the United States, and that's Abbott, Texas, because any town that can produce Willie Nelson will always be close to my heart."", 'Not too long ago I was in Beaumont, earlier today, and they gave me a new pair of boots. Congressman Jack Brooks said they were stomping boots—to stomp Republicans on November the 4th.', ""But let me say this: I grew up on a farm, and I know you need high-top boots for things besides stomping Republicans. As you well know—and I see a few carriers out here in the audience—Republicans have a habit of spreading a lot of horse manure around right before an election. And lately, as you also know, it's getting pretty deep all over this country."", ""I noticed the other day in the news that former President Richard Nixon, one of the great Republican Presidents, as you know, has been writing campaign advisory memos for Ronald Reagan. When I saw where Ronald Reagan was getting his advice, I began to understand a few of the things he'd been saying a little bit better."", 'Yesterday, I noticed in the news also that Governor Reagan announced that he has a secret plan to get the hostages back. Those of you who remember past elections when Richard Nixon ran against Hubert Humphrey probably find that sounding familiar. Do you remember when Richard Nixon said just before an election in 1968 that he had a secret plan to win the war in Vietnam? You all remember that?AUDIENCE. Yes!', ""THE PRESIDENT. Well, here it is 12 years later, and we still don't know what Mr. Nixon's secret plan was to win the Vietnam war. Now, how many of you Texans with sound judgment, familiar with history, believe that Ronald Reagan has a secret plan to get the hostages back? How many of you think that?AUDIENCE. No!"", ""THE PRESIDENT. Governor Reagan, so far, has had a good opportunity, and he's done pretty well in keeping his plan secret. He's got a secret plan for providing for the well-being of retired Americans by calling four times to make social security voluntary. If there's any one plan I know that would put social security instantly into bankruptcy, it's to let people who want to withdraw from paying social security to do so. Voluntary social security would be the end of it. But Mr. Reagan says he's got a secret plan for correcting that defect."", 'Mr. Reagan has a secret plan for providing good health care for senior citizens by being against Medicare. He traveled all over this Nation, his first time in public life, working for the American Medical Association, campaigning against Medicare.', ""Mr. Reagan also has a secret plan for helping working families by being against the minimum wage. He said the minimum wage has caused more misery and more unemployment in America than anything since the Great Depression. I remember when we didn't have a minimum wage, and the Democrats proposed that it be 25 cents an hour. The Republicans were against it, said it was socialism or communism. Later, the Democrats proposed the minimum wage of 40 cents an hour. That's when I got my first job. The Republicans were against that enormous increase, and they said that a working man or a working woman trying to support a family wasn't worth 40 cents an hour."", ""Mr. Reagan also has a secret plan to take care of working families who are temporarily unemployed without unemployment compensation. He says that unemployment compensation is just a prepaid vacation for freeloaders. That's the kind of secret plan that's still being put into effect. And as you know, Mr. Reagan has already revealed one of his secret plans for curing pollution. He wants to cut down all the trees in the United States. He said that's where the pollution comes from."", ""Well, there's one more thing that the Republicans are covering up, perhaps a little more deeply than most, and that is a crucial issue to you, even more important, perhaps, than social security, Medicare, minimum wage, unemployment compensation, and that's our Nation's defense. As long as I'm President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the military forces, we're going to have a strong nation, because I know that only through strength can we stay at peace."", ""In the 7 years before I became President, when Republicans were in the White House, in 7 of the 8 years, we had a decrease—a decrease—under the Republicans, in real funds for our Nation's defense. That, ladies and gentlemen, is not compatible with the philosophy of Texas Democrats, to cut defense spending in 8 years, under Republicans, 37 percent. Since I've been in office, we've had an orderly, steady, effective increase, above and beyond inflation, every single year. And with the help of Democrats in the Congress, we're going to keep that steady, upward progress as long as I serve in the White House."", ""The state of our Nation's defense is a legitimate issue for a congressional and also a Presidential election, but there's no place in this campaign for false charges."", ""The latest example is my opponent's charge, for instance, that we are not involved in the Iran-Iraq war because we're weak. Obviously, that charge is untrue and false. Our country is strong. In fact, we have the most powerful naval force ever assembled in the Indian Ocean, with two carrier task forces in that region."", ""We have overwhelming naval and air superiority to protect our interests there. We've prepositioned equipment for 12,000 Marines and munitions for 500 American aircraft, and we've arranged, recently, for facilities to be used at five different sites in that crucial region. When I took office, we had virtually no defense at all, under Republican Presidents, in that region. Today, we've acted to keep the straits open and to protect our vital interests. I can tell you, ladies and gentlemen in Texas, we're ready."", ""Let me say, also, that we had no battle tank being built; now we've got one. We had no new armored personnel carrier being developed; now we've got one. The Trident missiles and the Trident submarine were in a stalemate; now they're being built and produced and launched and tested. We didn't have any way to defend our silo missiles; now the MX missile will give us that capability. We didn't have any air-launched cruise missiles then; now we'll produce 3,000 of them in the next year. We're making sure that throughout the world American defenses are strong, because that's compatible with the American character. Those defenses were weakened under Republicans, but under Democrats we're putting our Nation strong, and that's the way it's going to stay to keep the peace."", ""I want to cover one more issue which you may not hear much about here in Waco, but Bob Poage knows about it, Lloyd Bentsen knows about it, and others on this stage know about it, and that's international affairs. Sometimes a President and a Member of Congress have to make a difficult decision. Two years ago, my administration established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. Some of the Republicans thought it was a mistake. A billion people live there. That may not sound like it has anything to do with you, but listen to this about farm exports. Agriculture is a major element of the life of Texas. The fact is that since I became President, in that one nation alone, annual United States farm products exports to China have gone from zero to over $2 billion. The number one customer in the world for Texas cotton is the People's Republic of China."", ""We have quadrupled our sales of agricultural products to China in the last 2 years, and now, because of an agreement that we signed just last night in Beijing and in Washington, we'll be able to expand that trade even further. Under this agreement the Chinese will buy at least 6 million tons of American wheat and corn during each of the next 4 years. They can buy up to 9 million metric tons if they choose. Our best estimate is that next year they'll buy about 7.2 million metric tons of United States grain, and their purchase of Texas grain and cotton will continue to go up."", ""That's a lot of wheat. It may not be easy to understand how much 7 million tons is, but that's enough to make 15 loaves of bread for every man, woman, and child in the nation of China. This is good news for American farmers. It's good news for all Americans. As a matter of fact, in the last 3 1/2 years we've had the highest gross income of farmers in history, we've had the highest increase in net farm income in history. This year we are drilling more oil and gas wells in the United States than any year in history. We're producing more American coal than any year in history. And we've set records under Bob Poage's leadership; now we're following along."", ""In 1977 we set a world record in farm product exports—1978, a new world's record; 1979, a new world's record; 1980, the highest of all, $40 billion worth of American farm products going overseas to foreign customers. That's what we're doing for the people of Texas."", 'I might say in closing that this election year is a very crucial year for you, for your families, and for people that you love. The issues are sharply drawn. You remember the past history and the differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. I remember growing up on a farm. Franklin Roosevelt, the great Democratic President, said, ""We ought to give the farmers an equal chance and start the REA and turn on electricity in the farmhouses of America."" The Republicans, as you may remember, were against it.', ""Franklin Roosevelt thought that older people ought to be taken off the po' farms, as we called them, and given social security and some human decency and selfrespect and security in their older years. He proposed social security. The Republicans were against it. I've already mentioned the minimum wage. Democrats have always been for it; Republicans were against it."", ""The working families of this Nation have always been foremost in the minds of Democratic leaders. Your great leader, Lyndon Johnson, proved that when he was in office. You might think that your vote doesn't matter in a national election, but if just 28,000 people had changed their minds in Texas in 1960, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson would never have been able to serve this great country. This is how close it is. And in 1968, if just a few Democrats had been more enthusiastic in supporting our ticket, Richard Nixon would never have served in the Oval Office in Washington; we would have had Hubert Humphrey instead."", ""So, think about your families, think about your future, think about the defense of this country, think about the industrial complex of our Nation. I share the same philosophy you do and that Democrats have shared down through the generations. We believe in human beings and making sure that our people have a better life. We believe in self-respect for those who might be old or afflicted or poor or not well educated, who can't speak English well or who might be black."", ""We believe in giving people a better chance in life, more security—let them stand on their own feet, manage their own affairs, live a good life. That's what Democrats have always believed. But we also believe that the Government should not interfere in the private lives of human beings, and the free enterprise system should compete and be truly free. The Republicans talk big, but they talk to big business mostly. The profits to them are more important."", ""Let me tell you in closing what we've done the last 3 1/2 years. We have deregulated the price of oil and natural gas. Every President for many years has promised this, Democrats and Republicans. President Eisenhower vetoed a bill when he was in office, in 1956 I believe, that would have accomplished this purpose. We did it under a Democratic administration. Some thought we did it too fast; some thought we did it too slow. But the fact is that this has resulted in a great boon to the people of Texas. You've got in this State alone, compared to January of 1977, 914,000 people more holding jobs now. That's a good progress."", ""The unemployment rate in Texas since January of 1977, when I took over from a Republican President, is down 30 percent. Per capita income, that's how much the average Texan makes every year, has gone up over 40 percent in 3 1/2 years. We've taken the Government's nose out of the industrial system of our country. We've deregulated not only the oil and natural gas, we've deregulated the railroads, deregulated the airlines, deregulated the trucks, deregulated the financial institutions, working on the communication systems to let us have competition, good products, good sales overseas, good jobs for Americans, good competition, and let the people of this Nation have a better life."", ""That's what the Democratic Party has done for you now and in the past. And the Democratic Party, with your help when we whip the Republicans on November the 4th, you're going to have a better life for this country in the future."", 'Thank you very much. Go to work. God bless you all.']"

I look across this square and I see a monument to the heroes of the Confederacy, and I think back in history about that. And I realize that not only did John Kennedy stand here where I am, with one foot in Texas and one in Arkansas, but that Lyndon Baines Johnson stood here, too. And I remember that it was you who put me on the road to the White House to represent the finest elements of the South and the entire region and the finest elements of the Democratic Party, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart.', 'I was a farmer. My family have lived in this Nation more than 300 years. All of us have been farmers. I grew up on a farm as a boy during the depression years. My father or his father or none before him ever had a chance to finish high school, but I did. And the reason I did it was because we had a better life, because we had Democrats in the White House in Washington and a Democratic Congress that cared about human beings and believed in the alleviation of suffering and gave us a better chance than we would otherwise have had.', 'And I come from the part of the Nation, as you do, too, that believes in hard work, self-sacrifice, trust in our families, strong communities, a deep belief in God. And I pray that we never forget those values, which never change.', ""Today I want to talk to you just for a few minutes about the decision that you will be making on the 4th day of November. There is a great difference between myself and Governor Reagan. There's a great difference between the Republicans and the Democrats. But what we're talking about in this election, as the last days draw to a close, is the difference in the futures that we will have."", ""But as we plan for the years ahead, it's very important that we recognize the differences that do exist, because the Republicans would have you believe, in these last few days, that there's not much difference between us. On one side, we've got Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, and Lyndon Baines Johnson and what they mean to us in changing this Nation for the better. On the other side, we've got Herbert Hoover and we've got Richard Nixon and we've got Gerald Ford, and now we've got Ronald Reagan, the same tradition. And don't you forget it for a moment when you go to vote on election day."", ""And let's now talk about senior citizens for a moment. On the one side, you've got a party under Franklin Roosevelt that saw that it was not good for retired people to live on po' farms, as we called them in south Georgia, where they could no longer earn their own living. The Democrats wanted the senior citizens to have some decency in life and some security and some self-respect, so he proposed social security. The Republicans were against it."", ""Later on, we have seen my opponent, Governor Reagan, on four different occasions say he believes that social security program ought to be voluntary. A voluntary social security program would instantly face bankruptcy, and that would be the end of social security. And don't you forget this sharp difference that's going to be decided on November the 4th."", ""Let's talk about the working families of this country. Most people in this Nation have to work for a living. They're not rich, but they want to earn their own living."", ""I remember how it was, not too long ago, during the depression years: little boys and girls, not as big as my daughter Amy, who's now 13, working in sweatshops 113 hours a day and grown men and women slaving all day long from sunup to sundown, with no decent wage to buy their families something to eat and clothes to wear and shelter over their heads. And the Democrats proposed a minimum wage. It was only 25 cents an hour. The Republicans opposed it. Later, when I got my first job as a high school graduate, the minimum had been raised by the Democrats from 25 cents to 40 cents an hour. The Republicans were against it. The Republicans said the minimum wage was socialism, communism."", ""That's not ancient history, because let me tell you what Governor Reagan says about the minimum wage. He says that the minimum wage has caused more misery and more unemployment than anything in this Nation since the Great Depression—a difference that's very important when you make a decision on November the 4th if you care about working families."", ""Sometimes in our society we have changes take place: factories close down, move to another community; sometimes buying habits of people change and you no longer have people building buggies and other things, there's a shift to automobiles—temporary unemployment. Democrats know that during those times, Americans who want jobs don't draw a paycheck for a few weeks. So, the Democrats put forward the idea of unemployment compensation. It's paid for by the workers and employees. It's kind of an insurance program."", ""Governor Reagan says that unemployment compensation is a prepaid vacation for freeloaders. We're not talking about freeloaders. We're talking about people who want to work, who have been working, who've paid their own insurance, but want their families to eat, if they are temporarily unemployed."", ""Let's talk about Medicare. Medicare is a Democratic program put forward under Harry Truman, so that when you reach your retirement age, in addition to social security—and the payments are taken out of your social security, as you know-it provides health care for senior citizens. Democrats are very proud of this program. It was opposed by the Republicans. They thought it was socialism again."", ""And Ronald Reagan, who's running against me for President, said that he was against Medicare, that it was a program that would let the Government of the United States take over the medical system of this Nation and take away the freedom of our people. As the representative of the American Medical Association, he traveled all over this Nation trying to kill Medicare. A great difference is going to take place on election day depending on your decision."", ""I see this statue. I'm a southerner, and I'm proud of it. And I'm going to talk to you just a moment about something that's very important to southerners, and that's civil rights."", 'There was a time in our Nation, in our part of the country, when the laws were passed to prevent black people from having their constitutional rights or even the right to vote in an election. I look out over this audience, and I see black and white southerners here together, sharing a common life, better under the Democrats, rights guaranteed. The man responsible for that change was your neighbor from Texas, Lyndon Baines Johnson. And when the civil rights legislation was passed, it made us proud. But Governor Ronald Reagan said that the civil rights legislation was bad legislation. Those are the kind of things that will be decided by you in 10 days from now, on November the 4th.', ""Let's talk about employment. In the last 3 1/2 years, as Lloyd Bentsen said, we've added almost 9 million new jobs in this Nation, in spite of OPEC oil prices and international problems that were created all over the world in the economy. In Texas alone, compared to the day I was inaugurated in 1977, there are 914,000 more people holding jobs today than there were 3¼ years ago, and in Arkansas 195,000 more people on the job than the day I was inaugurated President. That's the kind of record the Democrats have."", 'If you\'ll pardon me, let me mention Governor Reagan one more time, because we\'re looking to the future. He\'s for the so-called Reagan-Kemp-Roth tax program, a big giveaway program for rich people that\'ll saddle the Americans with enormous inflation. That\'s not just my opinion. President Ford, a Republican, who supports Reagan in this election, refuses to endorse that ridiculous tax proposal. Even the Wall Street Journal and Business Week said it won\'t work. And Mr. Reagan\'s own Vice-Presidential candidate, George Bush, said if the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal is put into effect, it\'ll cause a 30-percent inflation rate. As a matter of fact, George Bush said then it was ""voodoo economics."" That\'s the kind of approach that Democrats want to prevent, that\'s at stake with your jobs and with inflation in the future.', ""I want to mention a couple of other things. One is that the Democrats believe that our air ought to be pure and that our water ought to be clean and that the land God gave us over which to be stewards would still be productive and not spoiled by poisons. Scientists have searched for a solution to the pollution problem for a long time. Governor Reagan has found the solution. He says pollution's caused by trees. [Laughter] Well, that's a pretty sharp difference from what I believe, because not too long ago I signed a reforestation bill that will make provisions for this whole area through here to reseed our forests and to build more trees. And God's going to help us, right? [Cheers]"", 'So, if you want to see the trees destroyed to control inflation [pollution], vote Republican. If you want to see the trees planted to make the air purer and deal with inflation [pollution] at its source, vote Democratic, a very good choice.', ""I know very clearly that this area here is interested in the production of energy. The small royalty owners are now being hurt by the new law passed under my administration. With the help of these men here, George Nigh in Oklahoma, the people in Louisiana, Lloyd Bentsen in Texas, all of you, we've now decided to change the law—it's already been done in the Senate, it'll be done soon—to exempt those small royalty owners from that tax."", 'We have a new energy policy that this country\'s never had before, one that\'s really serving well. Republicans in the long run have said, ""Let\'s decontrol the price of oil and gas to increase the production of American energy."" In 1956 a law was passed along those lines. I don\'t know the details. It was vetoed by President Eisenhower. But we knew that we had to address this in a way that would help the energy-producing States and also be fair to those who consume energy, in your State and around the Nation. So, we passed a new energy bill. It now provides that over a period of time, energy prices will be decontrolled. Already it\'s having great impact.', ""We've got more oil drillrigs running right now and gas drillrigs right now than ever before in history—3,164 as of midnight last night. And this year we'll have more oil wells and gas wells drilled in this country than in any year in history. You might be also interested in knowing that we're producing more coal this year than ever before in history."", ""On the other hand, we've got a Republican administration that wants to dismantle what we've done. Governor Reagan says the best approach to the energy problem is to repeal everything we've done, to dismantle the Department of Energy, and let the oil companies make all the decisions for our life in the future on energy. That's the decision you've got to make on November the 4th."", ""One other thing I want to say that's most important of all, more important than inflation, more important than how many jobs we've created in the last 3 1/2 years, and that is our defense capabilities and the preservation of peace."", ""Eight years before I became President, seven of those years expenditures for American defense went down. Under two Republican Presidents, the defense budget decreased by 37 percent. When I took over the Oval Office, the responsibilities of Commander in Chief, we began a steady, well-planned, sure increase every year, above and beyond inflation, to give us a strong defense. And as long as I'm in the White House, we'll have a strong defense, second to none on Earth in military equipment and in our Armed Forces personnel."", ""But at the same time, a President has to decide how to use that enormous power. You can't fly an airplane with just one wing, and having a tremendous defense establishment is just part of the job. That defense capability has got to be used to keep the peace. We've got to control nuclear weapons. Governor Reagan says, throw the nuclear weapons control treaty in the wastebasket. Let's start a nuclear arms race as a trump card to be played against the Soviet Union. We're trying to keep other nations around the world, like Libya and Iraq, from having atomic weapons. Our nonproliferation program is extremely important to every person who values life in this audience. Governor Reagan says that nonproliferation is none of our business."", ""Every President who's served in the Oval Office before me, Democrats and Republicans, have been faced with troubled times around the world, troubled places. Not a day has gone by that that wasn't the case. We've known that we had an enormous military structure in this country, but we've tried to deal with those problems peacefully."", 'Governor Reagan, on the other hand, when he\'s seen trouble spots around the world, is advocating sending in American military forces, in North Korea, in Ecuador, in Cuba, Cyprus, the Middle East, Rhodesia, Angola, Pakistan. Those trouble spots have been resolved diplomatically by other Presidents, but, while he still hoped to be President, he has said, ""Let\'s send in American military forces.""', ""These kinds of issues affect you and they affect me and they affect every person in this Nation and on Earth. I stand here needing your help. The issues are clearly drawn. A great deal is at stake, in your life, in the lives of those who live in the same home with you and those whom you love and who look to you for leadership. We've only got 10 days to go. It's going to be a close race in Louisiana. It's going to be a close race in Texas. It's going to be a close race in Arkansas. And we're behind right now, I would guess, in Oklahoma. And what you do the next 10 days will make a decision about what kind of nation we'll have in the years ahead."", ""Will we preserve the tradition of the Democratic Party? Will we have commitments made to a better life for working people of this land? Will we have older people having security in their declining years, give them a full, fruitful life, to honor them for what they've given this country? Will we have a better education for our children, better housing for our families, better jobs, better social security, better minimum wage? Will we have a strong defense? Will it be used for peace? These are the kinds of issues that face you, and the judgment is in your hands."", ""I would guess that most of you here are Democrats and will support me. But let me ask you to do this in the next 10 days: Get on the telephone, talk to those you see. There's no one in this audience that can't contact between now and election day 500 or 1,000 people, some of you maybe more, because the sound of your voice can be heard. If you'll help me, be partners in the future as you have been in the past, then we'll win on November the 4th; we'll stomp the Republicans and keep this Nation on the road to future progress."", 'Thank you very much.

I've just come here from New Jersey, where I had a chance to meet with a group, a large crowd like this group, to listen to questions that were important to private families. One of the great things about the Democratic Party—we've had the heritage from Franklin Roosevelt to Harry Truman to John F. Kennedy to Lyndon Johnson and now to me—is to remember what has been accomplished in your life, when Democrats have pulled together-[inaudible]—of this Nation, both in the White House and and also in the Congress."", ""I remember having grown up on a farm in south Georgia. And under Franklin Roosevelt, during the Great Depression years, we got for ourselves a new life. At that time, there was no social security. The Democrats were for it; the Republicans were against it. As you know—[inaudible]—children, 9 and 10 years old, were working in sweatshops, and adults were working at a wage that couldn't support their own families. The Democrats put forward a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour; the Republicans were against it. My first job was when the minimum wage went up from 25 cents to 40 cents, when I finished high school in 1941. The Democrats got that bill through; the Republicans were against it. They didn't figure the working families were worth 25 cents and then 40 cents an hour. The Democrats have always had their confidence in, and have always had their hearts go out to the working families of this country."", ""This hasn't changed. There is still a great threat in my Republican opponent to those same principles. He says the minimum wage has caused more misery and more unemployment than anything since the Great Depression. And he also refers to people who are drawing unemployment compensation as having a prepaid vacation for freeloaders. Democrats have always understood that with changing times there are going to be people who want to work, who are eager for a job, but who are temporarily unemployed."", ""Also, as you well know, it's important that our Nation be kept strong militarily, and that's what we've done in the last 3 ¼ years. For 8 years before I came to the White House, we had a steady decrease in the Nation's commitment to a strong defense. It went down 37 percent. Seven years out of eight, we had lower budget allocations for a strong defense. But you all have to remember that it takes two wings on an airplane for it to fly. Not only must we be strong militarily—[inaudible]—use that strength to maintain peace. The best weapon is one that never has to be fired in anger, and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his' life down or shed his blood on a field of battle."", ""Let me make just one other comment to you. As you know, we don't have very long to go before November the 4th. I'll do the best I can. Dale Sprik will do the best he can. Fritz Mondale will do the best he can, to make sure that we preserve the principles of the Democratic Party and give a better life to the senior citizens, to those who are afflicted, to the working families of this country, to maintaining strong families, to keep our Nation strong, but at the same time to keep it at peace. Those are the kinds of issues that affect every one of you now and for the next 15 or 20 years. So, think on these things-what's best for your family, what's best for the people that you love."", ""We're going all out these next 6 or 7 days in preparing for the last few days before the election. There's no one listening to my voice who cannot contact at least 500 people in the next 8 or 10 days and urge them to vote for a better future for this great country and a better future for the citizens in it, who have benefited in the past from the heartfelt concern of Democrats. And we want to keep Republicans out of the Oval Office and out of the Congress for the next 40 years. Help me. We'll win together.Thank you very much.""]"
67,Jimmy Carter ,"October 25, 1980","[""Thank you, Governor John Glenn. [Laughter] Senator Glenn is one of the great leaders of our Nation, a hero who has put the brightest feature of our country before the eyes of the entire world, as you know, in the military and now in the Senate. It's indeed an honor for me to be introduced by him. He's a man who is familiar with Ohio problems and international problems as well. I'm also grateful that Senator Howard Metzenbaum is here, another great leader. You are indeed well represented in the United States Senate."", ""I was with Lud Ashley and Don Pease earlier, and I'm very grateful today to be with two people that at this moment are even more important to me and that's Don and Carolyn Schaller and their family."", ""Bob Bergland, a great Secretary of Agriculture, is also here, and after my speech he will be available to answer questions from the farm organizations and the farm reporters, because what I've decided to do here on this beautiful farm is to make a more formal address, not only to this group assembled here but for the entire Nation, on one of the most important subjects that could possibly be discussed by any President and particularly during a campaign season, and that's on agriculture."", ""This is a story that hasn't been adequately told. And this speech will be recorded, and later it will be replayed in all the great agricultural States of the Nation. You might be interested in knowing, for instance, that the number one industry in New York State is agriculture, and, of course, I come from an agricultural State as well. I have to admit, looking out at this beautiful black soil, that we could use it as fertilizer on my farm— [laughter] —and make a better crop."", ""But today I want to make this speech verbatim so I will refer to my notes. And I wish you'd listen very carefully, because this message, that comes to you directly from me, will be going to literally millions of others in this Nation, both in the cities and on the farms, who believe that God has given us a great gift in our land over which we have a responsibility to exercise proper stewardship."", ""You have an important choice to make on November the 4th, not just between two candidates and two parties, but your choice could be between two different futures, for you and .for your children and for your country. Nowhere is that choice more clear than in the future of our Nation's agriculture."", ""The farm programs of the last five decades, 50 years, came originally from Franklin D. Roosevelt in the New Deal. Democratic Presidents and Democrats in Congress have supported and have improved these programs. For 8 years before I took office, Republican Presidents mismanaged the affairs of American farmers. They repeatedly vetoed needed price support legislation• Four times in 1973, 1974, and 1975, the two Republican Presidents embargoed farm exports, including those to some of our most important international trading partners, not to protect our Nation's strategic and security interests, but for the express purpose of driving American farm prices down. There was no real effort to develop new farm markets such as those in Mexico and in China."", 'The Republicans imposed price controls on food and cut off food aid to hungry nations while production costs on the farms soared. Poorly managed grain inspection as you well remember allowed substandard shipments of American grain overseas to tarnish the reputation of American farmers. Domestic markets were flooded with imported meat at the worst time for our farmers and our ranchers. Import quotas for dairy products went up five times in one year alone. By the time I took office, grain prices were in a tailspin.', ""Think back to 1976 and early 1977. Cattle producers were liquidating herds after 4 years of heavy losses. Farm income was dropping fast. Consumers and producers were in open confrontation. And our Nation's reputation as a reliable exporter of farm products had been severely damaged. In short, the farm policy that I inherited was an unholy mess."", ""I came into office with a lifetime of experience in farming. As a boy, I got up at 4 o'clock in the morning, as many of you did, to catch the mules and be in the field, waiting for it to be light enough so I would know how to plow the rows of cotton and corn and peanuts so that I would not plow up the crops as we tried to control the bermuda grass. And we got back to the house after sundown and then had to feed and water the livestock without electricity on the farm to help. I grew up learning the hard way about the hard work and the complex economics of farming, and how valuable and how vulnerable farm families are to distant economic events over which we had very little control or influence in those days."", ""I learned the value of listening to other farmers. That's why I appointed Bob Bergland, a farmer, as my Secretary of Agriculture. That was a radical departure from the Republican policy of recruiting from the boardrooms of large agribusiness corporations, from large banks, and from commodity exchanges, the Secretaries of Agriculture who served under Republicans' administration. That may explain the Republican indifference to the ordinary farmer, but I changed that, and this is how. And I hope you'll listen carefully."", ""First, we set out to reduce government interference and to return production and marketing decisions to farmers. The cornerstone of this policy is a farmerowned grain reserve, which has taken government out of the grain business. The grain reserve has become one of the most effective farm marketing tools ever devised. Just look at the results. In the last 4 years, we've had several record large crops; in wheat and corn there have been back-to-back record years. In 1979 we saw record yields unequaled in history in six major crops. Yet the bottom did not fall out of the market, thanks to the grain reserve. When prices began to weaken, enough farmers put their grain into the reserve on their own farms to cushion the market. They were able to hold off selling when prices dipped. And when prices rose, the farmers, not the middlemen, cashed in."", 'At the same time we began the reserve, we increased aid for building onfarm storage. Since 1976 farmers built 1.8 billion more bushels of on-the-farm grain storage capacity. And last month, I approved legislation to help build even more.', 'We did away with the out-dated and the rigid acreage allotment system, which you remember. Farmers were freed to make planting decisions based on market conditions, rather than on Federal bureaucratic conditions.', 'There were other accomplishments, too.', 'Beginning with the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977, which many of you helped to draft, I acted to bring price supports and loan rates in line with production costs. I sought price levels to keep pace with rapidly rising production costs and adjusted them higher again within the last 3 months. We adopted a formula for target prices based on the cost of production for each crop. When that formula failed to adjust rapidly enough, we corrected it with new legislation.', 'In contrast to Republican vetoes, I moved quickly to restore health to the dairy industry. Within weeks of taking office, I increased the support level. And then, we worked with Congress to enact an 80-percent-of-parity minimum. Last year we extended this authority.', ""I moved quickly to improve our inadequate promotion of agricultural exports. We lowered overseas barriers to our farm exports with the new trade treaty concluded last year. We opened trade offices, under Bob Bergland's leadership, in key importing countries. We greatly increased export credits and have worked hand in hand with the private sector through the cooperator program. Perhaps most important, we carefully laid the foundation for opening important new markets in foreign countries, like in China."", ""To protect and preserve our basic soil and water resources, I signed into law the landmark Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act. The Republicans attempted to weaken the agricultural conservation program. I strengthened it. I increased support for agricultural research by nearly 50 percent in just 3 years. I also moved quickly with special help to farmers who suffered from natural disasters like this summer's heat and drought. We expanded to $6 billion the economic emergency loan program we began in 1978, and I just signed into law a new crop insurance program to protect farmers against weather, crop disease, and insect losses."", 'My administration has also supported farmer cooperatives. We defended the Capper-Volstead Act against those who wanted to gut it. We kept the administration of this vital authority in the hands of the Secretary of Agriculture where it belongs. We supported export ventures by farm cooperatives and got rid of regulations that kept cooperatives from participating fully in commodity loan programs. We also expanded and modernized farm credit programs, including a special program for beginning farmers. Of all the funds loaned by the Farmers Home Administration in its 45 years, nearly half have been loaned by this administration.', ""My administration has been especially sensitive both to agriculture's unique energy needs and to the opportunity for farmers to become producers of energy. I assigned the highest priority allocation of all during energy shortages to agriculture."", 'We passed the windfall profits tax over Republican opposition, and I established a program to provide over $10 billion during this decade to produce gasohol from the crops of American farms. When I took office production of gasohol was barely measurable. I set a production capacity target of 500 million gallons of alcohol by the end of next year, enough so that gasohol will amount to 10 percent of all unleaded gasoline sold in America. Secretary Bergland has just approved guarantees for 15 new plants to produce 246 million gallons of alcohol. The result of all this speaks for itself.', ""In the 4 years of my administration, total gross farm income, total net farm income, total production, total consumption, and total farm exports topped any previous record of any period in the history of this Nation. Farm exports, in dollars and in volume, have set new records in every single year of my administration. We'll set another record with an $8 billion increase in exports this year for a total $40 billion, the biggest annual gain in history."", ""We have broadened and diversified our exports so that markets will be more sound in the future, with changing circumstances. We've more than tripled sales to Mexico. We've increased our feed grain exports to Japan and Italy. We are now selling almost 7 times as much to China and to Taiwan as we did in 1976. In fact, China is now the world's largest single buyer of American cotton and one of the largest buyers of American grain."", 'The sharp drop in farm prices that we inherited in 1977—and think back on those years—has reversed. Despite record production, which ordinarily would drive farm prices down, prices have risen steadily in the last 4 years. Corn has gone from $1.60 in 1977 to over $3. Wheat has gone from $2 to over $4. Cattle prices have doubled, from $32 to $64. Milk that sold for less than $10 in 1977 now sells for more than $13.', ""I'm not completely satisfied with the record I've outlined to you. The cost freeze and squeeze on farmers has been severe and has limited net farm income too long. But we've made good progress, working with you as partners, and more progress is still to come."", 'In contrast to this, my Republican opponent does not understand the complex reality of our farm economy. Just a few months ago he said that he was not familiar with parity. He said farm price supports, and I quote him, ""subsidize the inefficient."" He said, and I quote again, ""Dairy subsidies are subsidizing those who could not compete."" To be fair, my opponent recently dropped a lifetime of opposition to government farm programs. He now says he would keep the basic elements of my programs in effect. And why not? The farm programs of this administration work. American farmers will have to decide how confident they are of Governor Reagan\'s election year conversion.', ""For the next 4 years I will propose even more forward-looking farm programs. We'll use the experience of the last 4 years to draft the 1981 farm bill—as you know, it's up for repassage next year—that responds to various farm needs, but most of all to the family farm. As before, we'll work with farmers and with your own organizations in developing the new proposals as we did in 1977 which will shape your economic lives."", ""We're going to continue to reduce government regulation in our economy, including agriculture. We'll push ahead on fuel conservation, gasohol, solar innovations. We need to improve transportation systems for getting farm products to market, and to that end I've authorized an effort to create farmer-run transportation co-ops much like rural electric co-ops. We're going to help farmers export even more, improving the links between market development and assistance to developing nations, and increasing promotion of value added products like meat, poultry, breeding animals, and soy bean products. We'll continue to protect our farmland and the productivity of its soil. And we'll continue our efforts to expand research and education."", 'Before closing, I want to say a few words about the most controversial farm issue of this election year—the suspension of grain sales to the Soviet Union.', ""In 1976 I promised America's farmers that I would resort to an embargo only if our national security or foreign policy interests were threatened, and never just to keep prices down. I kept my word."", 'When the Soviets invaded Afghanistan earlier this year, last year in winter, I saw this for what it was: brutal aggression with ominous implications for the security of that region and, indeed, the world.', 'As your President, I took immediate action. I curtailed Russian fishing rights in our waters. I stopped the sale of many high-technology products that the Soviets needed. I stopped phosphate sales to the Soviet Union. And I suspended the shipment of grain beyond that included under our official Government agreement with the Soviets, 8 million bushels (tons)1 per year.', '1White House correction.', ""When I announced this, shortly before the Iowa caucuses, as a matter of fact, I told the American farmers we all would bear the costs—not just the farmers. I don't have any doubt that the farmers have borne the heaviest load. I recognize that. But we used tax dollars to remove from the market more grain than was originally scheduled to be sold to the Soviets. The net budget cost was less than $600 (million) . 2"", '2 White House correction.', 'I imposed restraints on trade with the Soviet Union for one simple reason. Their invasion of Afghanistan was brutal aggression which threatened the interests of the United States and the free world. These restrictions have hurt the Soviets, and they are going to continue to hurt as long as they are fighting and killing the people of Afghanistan.', 'The people of the Soviet Union are eating even less meat now than they did 5 years ago. They have less meat to eat in the Soviet Union than any other nation in all of Europe. Even their satellite countries are better off, and the Soviet situation is getting worse. This crop year they face a shortage of up to 60 million tons of grain, and they will not come close to making that up so long as the United States stands firm. And so long as Soviet aggression continues and the security threat exists, we will stand firm. We will continue to find more permanent and dependable customers for farm products to ensure that the American farmer does not suffer because of a lack of export opportunities.', ""My Republican opponent has tried to make political hay out of this decision. He claims to be opposed to the embargo. I think it's about time we look at the facts. The fact of the matter is that Governor Reagan publicly and directly opposed selling any grain whatsoever to the Soviet Union until he saw a chance to benefit politically from the decision that I had to make."", 'In 1975 he suggested using a grain embargo to force the Soviets out of Angola• In 1979 he threatened a similar grain embargo against Nigeria, the largest, most prosperous, and most influential country in Africa.', 'Three months before the invasion of Afghanistan, he said, and I quote, ""If the Russians want to buy wheat from us, I would not sell it to them."" The truth is that he never once raised his voice in opposition to the embargoes imposed under Mr. Nixon and Ford. And those embargoes were not imposed to protect our national interests. They were not directed against an aggressor nation. They were designed to do one thing and one thing only: to force down the prices American farmers get for your crops.', 'American farmers can decide now how much credit Mr. Reagan should get for reversing 5 years of public, unqualified support for food embargoes just in time for the election.', 'As I said at the beginning of this talk, the differences between me and my opponent, between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party are great. They are not just differences in degree. They are deep differences that will affect the life of everyone listening to my voice. They pose to you an important question: Do you want to place the critical questions facing American agriculture—energy, price supports, export development, soil conservation, cooperatives, science, education—in the hands of a man who has not shown a basic grasp of our farm economy? Or do you choose another like future, guided by the steady and experienced leadership of someone like you, a farmer, working with Bob Bergland, a farmer, and with farm organizations and you, the farmers of this Nation, who understand the problems and opportunities which are existing now before other American farmers who are not here today?', ""I want to strengthen our farm economy-for your sake, yes, but also for the sake of all the American people. I'm asking you for another 4 years as your President to continue to accomplish that worthy goal. I need your help on November 4."", 'Thank you very much. God bless you all.']"
68,Jimmy Carter ,"October 27, 1980","['THE PRESIDENT.

As Wendell Ford and Carl Perkins and Nick Joe Rahall and all of us who've served in Washington together know, most of the new ideas that come forward for us to address have already been understood and proposed by Jennings Randolph, because he has his heart close to the people of this Nation. And when there's a real need for better housing, better transportation, better use of coal, better life for the working families of this Nation, Jennings Randolph seems to have a special sensitivity to understand that need and to lead the rest of us in meeting those needs for all."", ""I'm grateful, too, to have a chance to come here to meet with people from Ohio, particularly Kentucky, because they are represented here by a great Governor and also by a great Senator. And Carl Perkins, a Congressman from across the river, is one of my greatest friends of all."", ""Let me say that I've spent the last few days thinking about the upcoming debate tomorrow night. As Wendell Ford pointed out, my opponent is not out campaigning among the people; he's trying to decide what role he's going to play in the debate tomorrow night. The problem that I've had in preparing myself for the debate is, which Ronald Reagan am I going to face tomorrow evening on television? Because as the election has progressed and as we get closer and closer to the voting time, he has flip-flopped on almost every conceivable issue depending upon what audience happens to be listening to him at the particular time."", ""He's been strongly against, even prayed against, aid for New York City, but lately he's been in New York, telling them how much he loves New York. He was against many things for which he now professes to support. Not too long ago, as a matter of fact this October, to the automobile workers in the Chrysler plant, he was telling them how proud he was that the Federal Government, with the help of the people on this stage, had helped Chrysler stay solvent. But that contrasts with the Ronald Reagan of last October, who said he didn't see anything wrong with Chrysler going bankrupt."", 'I don\'t know if I\'ll be debating the Ronald Reagan who now professes to be for safety and health of workers, or one who replied not long ago when somebody said that OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, ought to be abolished, who stood there and said, ""Amen."" I don\'t know if I\'ll be debating a man of this election campaign who now professes to be for improving the social security system, or one who on at least four different occasions has suggested making social security voluntary, a proposal that would mean the end of a strong and viable social security system.', ""I don't know if I'm running against a man who opposed selling grain to the Soviet Union last year, or the one who declined this year to support the grain embargo after the Soviets had invaded Afghanistan. I don't know if I'm debating a Ronald Reagan who now professes to be for working families, but who's against labor law reform, who's against the Davis-Bacon Act, who said about the minimum wage that it's caused more misery and more unemployment than anything since the Great Depression, and who said just this year again that the primary cause of unemployment was the minimum wage."", ""I don't know if I'm debating against a man who now professes to be for working families who are temporarily unemployed, or one who said not too long ago that unemployment compensation was just a prepaid vacation for freeloaders. I don't know if I'm debating a man who lately professes to be almost in the image of Franklin Roosevelt, or one who a little earlier said that the foundation for the New Deal was fascism."", ""I may be having difficulty predicting what Governor Reagan will be saying in this debate, but we all know which Ronald Reagan would sit in the Oval Office if the Republicans win this election. It'll be the same Ronald Reagan who said just a few weeks ago that he hasn't changed his position in the last 20 years, the Ronald Reagan who worked to kill Medicare, who opposes national health insurance, who rejects a decade of progress in nuclear arms control, who wants to scrap the synthetic fuels program, which will take coal from this region and convert it into synthetic fuel, that's the key to breaking the OPEC stranglehold which they formerly had on us."", ""There's one thing in this election that is certain, though, and I want you to listen very carefully to this, because you've got a good voting record in this area. Republicans always campaign like Democrats. You've heard them. They quote Franklin D. Roosevelt; they quote Harry Truman; they quote John Kennedy; they quote Lyndon Johnson. But think about this question: Have you ever heard a Republican candidate for President quoting a Republican President?AUDIENCE. No!"", ""THE PRESIDENT. NO. Never, never. But when they get in the Ova Office, they're just like all the Republican Presidents that have caused hardship and trial and tribulation and forgotten the working families of this country, but they try to mislead you the last few days before the election. That's one thing you can count on. Republicans will govern like Republicans. Don't you forget it on election day."", ""I want to say just a word about coal. I'm proud to have been able in my administration, working with your Democratic Governors, United States Senators, the Members of Congress, to do more for the coal industry than ever before in the history of this country. Listen to this: We will produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America. We will exceed 800 million tons for the first time, and the trend is in the right direction. This is the first year in our history in which more than 50 percent of all our Nation's electricity has been produced from coal."", ""Our exports of coal to foreign countries will set an alltime record this year. And we could load millions more tons of coal on ships to be sold overseas if we just had the transportation system and the port loading facilities available for this new demand for coal that's been brought about by the policies of our administration."", ""In the near future, as you know, you will have an exciting, new, bright life ahead of you as we begin to produce synthetic liquids and gaseous fuels from your coal. We can triple—triple—United States coal production in the next 15 years if we keep Democrats in office to help you. That's where we need your help."", ""As you know, over the past several weeks, since the Congress has finally passed our new energy policy into law, we've begun to move on our new synthetic fuels program. We've signed historic agreements to help finance and to guarantee the construction of synthetic facilities, including the SRC-1 program in Kentucky and the SRC-2 plant in West Virginia. These major plants will be the forerunner of others in this Nation and will show why 75 percent of the $88 billion in windfall profits tax will go to produce synthetic fuels out of coal."", ""The American people have to understand, though, and this is an important thing for you to remember, that coal is both a clean fuel and also a safe fuel. If we are ever to achieve our goal for energy security, do not let anyone try to convince .you that the best way to produce and' use more American coal is to lower air quality standards or water quality standards. To do that will turn the American people and the world against coal."", ""What these men on the platform and I have done, working with Sam Church, the president of the United Mine Workers, is to try to make sure that all the projected increases that I've described to you, all of them, include maintaining the quality of our environment. We do not have to make people choose between jobs and prosperity on one hand and good health and a beautiful America on the other. We can burn coal, let it be the bright new vision of an independent policy in the future, and still keep our air clean and our water clean and our land productive. Do not let anyone mislead you about that, because the best way to turn people against coal is for them to think that we have to lower those standards for air and water quality."", 'Last week the Environmental Protection Agency extended a plan in Ohio which will allow greater use of coal. This plan sets limits on average emissions over a 30-day period, rather than a daily average. And this will continue on into 1982. This would allow much greater use of Ohio coal.', 'Also last week the EPA and Armco Steel Company reached agreement on an innovative approach to control air pollution of the Armco plant in Middletown, Ohio. Instead of controlling each individual source, it limits the total pollution emitted from an imaginary bubble over the entire plant. This allows the company to concentrate its cleanup efforts on sources that are the least costly to control. The result is more pollution control per dollar spent. This is the first practical application of this new principle. And now other steel companies throughout the Nation can do the same, reducing pollution control costs and thus raising capital or money to modernize their facilities and to put more people to work.', ""Just last Friday we announced a grant to finance a coke production plant in Canova, West Virginia. This would not only mean new jobs at the plant when it's finished, but 300 construction jobs and 1,500 miners will go to work now in West Virginia, in Virginia, and in Kentucky."", 'In order to meet export demand we are going to rebuild our railroads; we are going to improve our highways; we are going to improve our loading facilities at our major seaports. In international energy markets my goal is to replace OPEC oil with West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky coal.', ""And finally, let me say this: Coal is important for the security of our Nation. Many of you have spent your lives in the coal mines and in the communities surrounded by the mines. You've contributed a lot to the quality of life of other Americans. But it's important, too, to remember the well-being and the health and the safety of the miners and the miners' families, to protect the interests of the mineworkers. Working with President Sam Church and your representatives, we have broadened black lung protection, we've guaranteed mineworkers' pensions, and I've requested extensions of trade adjustment assistance and unemployment benefits so that workers do not have to bear all the hardships as our Nation faces up to rapidly changing economic circumstances and prepares for a brighter economic future."", ""If American workers have the tools and the training, they can out-produce any workers on Earth. And we're going to give them the tools and training. With a new energy policy as a foundation, we're ready to move into the future and rebuild opportunities for jobs and a brighter and more prosperous life for Americans. At the end of the Second World War, America rebuilt the industry of Germany; America rebuilt the industrial complex of Japan. And now it's time for us to rebuild the industrial complex of the United States of America, and that's what we're going to do. You help me, I'll help you; we'll have a better future in the years ahead if Democrats are in office."", ""Thank you very much. I'm counting on you. Work this last week.""]"

We're a party that believes in unity; we're a party that believes in strength; and we are a party that has proven that we believe and can maintain peace in this country and around the world."", ""As I'm sure you all know from watching the debate last night, that the choice next Tuesday is not just between me and Governor Reagan, it's not just between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party; it's a choice between two vastly different concepts or beliefs concerning what this Nation must be. It's a choice between two vastly different futures for America. The meaning of that choice is not just in what he and I say but in the consequences of our words, the consequences of what we believe, the consequences of what we will do. The choice is crucial, and the consequences to your life, to the lives of the members of your family, and to those that you love, are very grave."", ""The President of the United States is not just a servant of the present, he's also the guardian of the future. His actions echo down through the ages in the judges he appoints, the regulatory board members he names, the legislation he gets passed through Congress, the ideals established in the hearts and minds of the American people, and the agenda which he sets for the Nation's future. When he sits as one negotiator at the head of state with other national leaders from around the world, he must be careful, because his words weigh heavily on the hearts and minds of people everywhere. He represents what this Nation is and what this Nation can be. He must be sensitive to the concerns and the ideals of America, and he must be adamant in his protection of America's interests."", ""Never does a day go by, in my duties in the Oval Office, when there is not some serious trouble somewhere on Earth. A President must decide, sometimes alone, what are America's interests, what degree of involvement should be our role. As Commander in Chief, the President of this country has within his power to unleash the most awesome, destructive military force in the history of the world. If he is skillful, if he is wise, if he is thoughtful, if he is moderate, if he is careful, if he is courageous, if he remembers America's beliefs and character, it's a task which I pray God will never have to be performed. We must not get ourselves in a situation where the horrible power of atomic weaponry. is unleashed on this world."", ""As President I have had to make some difficult decisions, thousands of them, and as I said last night, with each one of those decisions, I learn. I learn about this Nation, its strengths, its needs. I learn about our people and the possibilities for an improved life for them. I expect to make many more decisions. I've fought some bitter fights, as you know, against special interests. I carry some political scars because of those fights, and I carry those scars with pride. I've made some mistakes, and I've taken the heat for them, and I've learned from them. And because I have learned I'm a better President now, and I'll be a better President in the next 4 years."", ""A President in these modern times must have patience. A President in these modern times must have compassion. When the toughest decisions are made, a President cannot rely upon advisers, because the most difficult decisions will often find advisers divided 50-50 on both sides of an issue. He cannot rely on ideology, and he cannot rely on maxims or sayings or memories from the distant past. He must have sound judgment to act, when necessary, alone, and that's why this campaign must focus on the real issues and their consequences for the future for every human being on Earth."", ""We have got serious problems these days, problems that involve economics, but the outlook is improving, as you well know. The shocks that hit this Nation in 1974 because of OPEC oil price increases caused the deepest recession since the Second World War. We've just been through the smallest and the shortest recession, because we had planned for this eventuality. In 1979 oil price increases were greater in one year than they had been since oil was first discovered in the 1800's. The inflation rate has been high lately, yes—earlier in this year, 18 percent, and then later, the second quarter, 13 percent; the most recent quarter just ended, 7 percent. Inflation is still too high, but I'd like to remind you that in the past when our Nation has been tested we have never failed the test."", ""Just in my lifetime I remember the Great Depression. I remember the Second World War, the Korean war. I remember the social changes that took place in our Nation, very difficult changes, when we gave equality of opportunity and voting rights to our black citizens and others. And I remember the divisiveness of the Vietnam war, the tragedy and the embarrassment of Watergate. All those problems that I've just named were much greater in scope than anything we face today. But when our Nation is united, when we analyze our blessings, when we remember what God gave us, this Nation has never failed to answer any questions. This Nation has never failed to solve any problems, and this Nation has never failed to overcome any obstacle, no matter how great it might be. We've got a great nation, the greatest on Earth, and in my belief, we'll have a greater nation in the future."", 'Let me comment on just one other specific thing that was covered really for the first time in the debate last night. It involved the most important issue of all-lifting the shadow of nuclear terror from this Earth. Last night Mr. Reagan flatly denied that he had ever made the statement that nuclear proliferation is none of our business. Let me read you something verbatim from the New York Times of February 1st this year, and I quote, ""Ronald Reagan indicated today that he believed the United States should not stand in the way of countries developing their own nuclear weapons, saying, and we quote Mr. Reagan, \'I just don\'t think it\'s any of our business.\'""', 'This issue is the most important single issue in the campaign this year. Inflation is important. Unemployment is important. The progress of our Nation economically is important. Education is important. But the most important single issue is the control of nuclear weapons. Every President since Harry Truman has worked under the most difficult circumstances to negotiate with the Soviet Union balanced, controlled, observable agreements to limit atomic weapons with the hope of reducing those weapons in the future.', ""The treaty that I have negotiated was begun by President Nixon and continued by President Ford. It's now before the Senate. It's not yet come to the floor for a debate or a vote. Governor Reagan has said, let's throw that treaty in the trash and not let the Senate debate 'this important issue. Let's put forward a nuclear arms race and demand nuclear superiority in hopes that we can get some better deal from the Soviet Union."", ""This approach of his is a radical departure from the most serious commitment that all my predecessors in the Oval Office have had since the Second World War. And combined with his belief that it's none of our business if a radical and terrorist nation like Libya has the atomic weapon, this particular issue on nuclear arms, nuclear weapons, atomic bombs, is the most serious of all."", ""In closing let me say this: I've described the election of 1980 to you as a choice between two futures. Here's what I see in the future that we are fighting for together. I see a nation strong and at peace. I see a nation secure in the pursuit of progress for all people; a nation where everyone can have the dignity of a decent job, where new industries create a new generation of American buildings and American vehicles that will house us and move us in comfort with a lot less energy, and that energy that we use coming from America itself; a nation where children are educated to their maximum potential, where the elderly are treated with respect, which they've earned, where families are strong and intact and secure. I have a vision of a nation free enough to attract and strong enough to welcome the deprived from other parts of the world, a nation of liberty and justice and love."", 'I need your help to make this vision a reality. Together let us make the greatest nation on Earth even greater in the future. You help me and we will do that together.', 'Thank you very much. God bless you all.']"

And I don't know any other group in this Nation that has done such a good job during the last years in which I've lived, in the last 30 or 40 years, than the black ministers of this Nation, who have kept in the forefront of what our Nation stands for."", ""The civil rights movement changed the South, it changed this Nation, and after we got to the point of having people like Andrew Young and Don McHenry speak for our Nation, it's changed the image of this country in the eyes of the entire world. And a lot of that credit goes to people like you throughout this Nation, the black ministers of America, and I thank you for it. And I might say also that our Nation has also got to keep its eyes upward and forward."", ""Sometimes we stumble. Sometimes we go through disappointments, trials, tribulations. Sometimes we have temporary inconveniences. Sometimes we have frustrations. Sometimes things don't move as fast as we'd like for them to move. And it takes an inner spirit and an inner faith and an inner commitment and some deep, personal courage to retain leadership in times like that. I think that Howard Woodson is a man of that kind."", ""Not too long ago he was in the White House with me. He flew back with us on Air Force One to Philadelphia. He's been an adviser for me not only in a spiritual way but also when he was Speaker, now working with the Governor. And many of you, like him, have kept a proper balance between a deep religious faith, the service of those who look to you for leadership, and a direct involvement in politics, particularly when election day approaches. And that is one reason that I came tonight—to talk to you about that."", 'Newark, Essex County represent the kind of challenges that I share as President of this country, serving in the Oval Office, looking at its hopes and its potentials, its needs and its problems, because many of the programs that my administration has initiated has been targeted to the needs of this very city and other cities in this county.', ""Newark, for instance, has received the second highest number of Urban Development Action Grants, UDAG grants, of any city in this Nation, regardless of size. Essex County has received the single largest grant in the country under my new urban parks program, and Essex is second only to Cook County, where Chicago's located, in the total urban parks funding. But I know and you know that we ought not to stand here and brag on what has been done. Let's look to the future about what we're going to do together. And I want to make a personal pledge—not under any pressure, because nobody asked me to to do it—to enter into a new and a full and a greater partnership with the city of Newark, with the county of Essex, with the State of New Jersey, so that we can make a real difference here in the years ahead."", ""Ken Gibson, Brendan Byrne, representatives of the private sector, officials such as Peter Shapiro, Peter Rodino, Joe Minish, who are here, Senator Bradley, and others are working together in a constructive way in this city. And they've come to me with a coordinated plan, a concept whereby the Federal Government, the State government, the local government, the private employers, and the people who work here spell out for this community a much better and a brighter life. I'm not going to list for you all the different projects and programs that are already underway, but if you think back 4 years ago when Brendan Byrne was beginning to change the concept of New Jersey about itself and build a new sense of pride and partnership and progress and idealism and confidence, I'm very proud to have been part of that change."", ""I want this group to come to Washington after the election and work, to meet to see what we can do in the future as an even stronger team, because I see a determination here on the part of the mayor and the Governor and others, and I'm determined that my administration will be a genuine part of this effort."", ""The other things at stake in this election, in addition to a better life, better jobs, more employment, less suffering, better education, better housing, better transportation, better cohesion among people who are different from one another, better understanding, better progress, more equality—these kinds of things are part of our national consciousness. But also at stake in this election is whether we'll continue to build social justice in our country. It's clear that there's a sharp difference between the longstanding, historical commitment of the Democratic Party, on the one hand, and the very sharp, differing commitment or lack of commitment in the Republican Party."", ""All you've got to do is sit here in the quietness of this sanctuary and think about the changes that took place under Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and John Fitzgerald Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. And I think the last 3 1/2 years is part of that Democratic mainstream of progress and compassion and concern and good management. And I think about the other times when Democrats were not in the White House and what the cause of the outcome of those elections was. I'll mention that in a few minutes."", ""But I think you know that Democrats and I stand for vigorous enforcement of our civil rights laws; for open housing amendments to make sure that we do not have any longer discrimination in where people have a right to live; for the equal rights amendment, to give women a chance for equality under the Constitution of the United States; for national health insurance; for the strengthening of social security; for the preservation of minimum wage to apply equally to all people; for aid to cities, where the central part of the cities might have been deteriorating in the past; for aid to our public schools; for the youth bill that will give 600,000 new young people jobs at a cost of $2 billion over the next 2 years; for tough standards of quality for environment; and for strong protection for consumers of all kinds. That's what I stand for. That's what the Democratic Party stands for. But my opponent's positions are just as clear, and they could not be more different from mine."", ""I didn't come here tonight to spend my time criticizing him. But I think it's important to remember that 16 years ago, he launched his political career, contrary to some of the comments that he made last night, as a spokesman for the American Medical Association and the anti-Medicare lobby. He campaigned all over this Nation trying to kill Medicare. And he has called repeatedly for making social security a voluntary program. Last night he stated—I don't know if you noticed it—that for a young person to contribute to social security is a bad investment. That's not true, and that's typical of what he has been saying over many years. It's an outstanding investment, no matter what the level of income of an American citizen might be."", 'Today he says, and I quote him, ""I am firmly opposed to national health insurance."" What we want is a health insurance program that will have an emphasis on prevention of disease, an emphasis on treating of patients outside the hospital whenever possible instead of inside the hospital, a commitment to controlling hospital costs so they don\'t go up so high that people can\'t afford them, an emphasis on medical care and proper diet for women who are about to have little babies and for those little babies once they are born, for catastrophic health insurance to make sure that a family doesn\'t get wiped out economically with an unexpectedly high medical bill. Those commitments, as part of this program, will be an. extension of social security, an extension of Medicare, and will give the American people better health care at a much reduced cost.', 'Fifteen years ago he said that the Civil Rights Act was, and I quote, ""a bad piece of legislation."" And this year he says, and I quote him again, ""Urban aid programs are one of the biggest phonies that we have in the system."" This year, as you know, he blamed pollution on trees and volcanoes, and then after taking three or four different positions in the same day, he flew home to Los Angeles to rest. And as you know, his plane couldn\'t land at the airport, because the smog was too thick. [Laughter]', ""Well, the pattern that I've just outlined—a few examples shows the difference. The choice on November the 4th is not just between me and Governor Reagan, it's not just between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. The choice is between two clear beliefs about what America is, two clear commitments, sharp, different, about what America ought to be, two vastly different futures for our country. And as the time for the election approaches next Tuesday, it's important on every one of you as a leader in your own right, who can reach a thousand or perhaps 10,000 people between now and election day to think about how this difference might affect you personally, the members of your own family, the people that you love, or the people who love you."", 'The consequences of what Governor Reagan believes, what he says, what he will do in the Oval Office is what makes the choice so crucial. Governor Reagan said last night in the debate that when he was young, and I quote, ""This country didn\'t even know it had a racial problem.""', 'AUDIENCE MEMBER. He had to be real young. [Laughter]', 'THE PRESIDENT. Well, Governor Reagan may not have known, but to millions and millions of Americans, including some in this congregation, who suffered racial prejudice and racial injustice for 300 years, it was not simply a problem; it was a lifelong disaster.', 'I don\'t know what you\'re going to do the next 5 days. It may be that you\'ll go back to your home or to your church and say, ""I went to a rally at Bethany Baptist, and I think I\'ve done enough because my presence there added esteem or prestige to the congregation."" And you might say, ""I\'m sure the rest of those ministers and the rest of those public officials are going to take care of the election. And if they work hard, New Jersey will be in the Democratic column, so I don\'t need to do very much."" Or it may be that you\'ll say, ""This is the most important decision that\'s been made politically in my lifetime, and what I do might make the difference between who is elected President, who will serve the next 8 years or perhaps the rest of this century, which party will be in power in the Oval Office.""', ""I believe in the Democratic Party myself. I believe in the legacy that I've inherited from the Presidents that have served there before me. I believe in the mission of the Democratic Party. Every great advance that's taken place in this country in this century that has affected your lives, from collective bargaining to the minimum wage, to social security, to Medicare, to Medicaid, to civil rights legislation—every single one of those has been made possible by Democrats, almost invariably over the opposition of Republicans."", 'Our party stands for progress. Our party stands for justice. When workers sought to organize, they looked to the Democrats. When older citizens said they needed security in their retirement years, they called on the Democrats. When Americans wanted justice and opportunity and basic rights, they turned to the Democrats and the Democrats always came through.', ""Today Americans are once again looking for the Democrats, not in the past, not even in the present, but in the years ahead, for national health insurance, for jobs and training for our young people, for a strong, new economic future, for human rights and equal rights. And with your help the Democrats are going to come through on November the 4th, and we're going to whip the Republicans again in New Jersey."", ""You might say one person can't make a difference. I want to repeat something I said last night, because I would like for you to carry it away in your mind and in your heart. One person can make a difference. In 1960 if 28,000 people had voted different in Texas and just a few thousand had voted differently in Illinois, John Kennedy would never have been President; likely, Lyndon Johnson would never have been Vice President or President. The Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act, would never have come into being in this law of the land, and our country would have been a different land, for you and for your families. That's a story with a good ending."", ""In 1968, if just a few more Democrats had done our duty, things would have been different. Who put Richard Nixon in the Oval Office in January of '697 It was not the Republicans, because they are supposed to and they're expected to vote for their nominee. The people that put Richard Nixon in the Oval Office instead of Hubert Humphrey were the Democrats, not the ones who voted, but the ones who didn't vote and didn't work."", 'You remember that year, and Rosie Grief remembers vividly the personal tragedies of that year. The election returns were one of those personal tragedies, but I remember that Senator Robert Kennedy made a speech on the last day of what was to be his final campaign, in the Presidential primary in California, in 1968. And I would like to share with you, to close my remarks, the closing lines of that speech that you can carry away from here in your hearts, and I quote Robert Kennedy. He said, ""I ask you to recognize the hard and difficult road ahead to a better America, and I ask you to vote for yourselves. The people,"" he said, ""must decide this election, and they must decide so that no leader in America has any doubt about what the people want. For your sake and for your children,"" he said, ""vote for yourselves.""', ""You devote your time and your talents and every last measure of your strength to show them that you as children of God, as leaders who are trusted, who are put here for a purpose, that each one of you has a precious life to contribute to the service of others. Every Sunday morning you preach to those who will listen. Every one of those people who listen to you counts, and it matters to you and to all of us if they're weak or if they're strong, if they're blessed or if they suffer. But it's in our hands about what kind of life they will have on this Earth in the future."", ""I need you to be my partners in this next 5 days, to make an effort, above and beyond what you intended to make when you came here. It's not enough to just be a Democrat. It's not enough just to have a good voting record. It's not enough just to preach a sermon on Sunday outlining the differences that will be decided on Tuesday. I'd like to ask you to leave here with the commitment in your heart and mind to do everything you possibly can to make sure that every single registered person votes on November the 4th. And if you do, we'll have a better life in this Nation; we'll continue the progress that you've seen under Democratic Presidents. And we'll have a nation not only great, as we've seen it already, but even greater in the years ahead. That's what I want from you."", 'Will you do it for me? [Applause]']"

Philadelphia lately, meeting with Mayor Bill Green, and having my wife come here, and my son, Chip, come here, and the Vice President come to Philadelphia. It's a wonderful year to congratulate Philadelphia, because you've won it all, I think. The Phillies won the World Series, the Eagles are doing okay. You've won the Saratoga. The Forrestal is next. It's just a good year all around."", ""There's one more victory that I want to see you win, not only for Philadelphia but for Pennsylvania and the whole country. Does anybody know what that is? [Applause and cheers] Right on. Next November the 4th, next Tuesday, you will make a decision that will affect your own lives, the lives of your families, the life of this Nation."", ""I also want to thank another guest, Stanley Walesa, who's here with me this morning. As you know, he too is associated very closely with the recent victory, a human victory in Poland for all mankind. I know you are very proud of what his son has accomplished. His commitment to the rights of working people has been and is an inspiration to the entire world."", ""As you know, the Republican leaders have criticized my commitment on behalf of this Nation to the principle of protecting human rights, not only in our own country but in other nations. This is a deep commitment of mine, but they seem to think it's naive for America to stand up for freedom and to stand up for democracy. I disagree with that very strongly. If we in the land of freedom do not stand up for human rights, then what is it, what is the meaning of America? What should we stand for? What should our commitment be? Just ask the Polish workers who are struggling for human progress. Ask them if America should stand up for human rights."", 'I come to you today in Philadelphia, the city where our American rights were first ratified. I come to you as a leader of the Democratic Party, a party that has embraced human rights since the time of Thomas Jefferson. I come to ask your support on November 4th, because we share the same values and the same commitments. For almost two centuries the Democratic Party has opened its arms, as you know, to every American of every culture, every background, every religion. When I form the policies of our Nation in international affairs these days, my two closest advisers represent families who came here from Poland, Secretary of State Ed Muskie and National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski.', ""It's important that we remind ourselves that ours is a nation of immigrants; we're a nation of refugees. And when every new wave of refugees or immigrants came to this country it was the Democratic Party that opened its arms and its hearts to them, gave them a role to play in shaping of our country and in the hammering out for all Americans strength, but the preservation of those precious, individualistic commitments of religion and family and heritage and blood kinship."", ""The Democratic Party has been on the cutting edge of change and tolerance. When people said that no Roman Catholic could be President, ours is the party, the Democratic Party, that nominated and then elected John Fitzgerald Kennedy. We've come a long way since 1960. Twenty years ago the enemies of that Roman Catholic Democratic candidate said that if John Fitzgerald Kennedy were ever elected President, the Pope would someday stand on the steps of the White House. Those critics were right. They were a little off on their timing, though- [laughter] —because Pope John Paul II arrived at the White House in 1979, and I'm proud to say that he was welcomed there by a Southern Baptist."", 'We have come a long way. America has a Southern Baptist as a President, now elected with the support of northern Catholics, and the world at last has a Polish Pope. Who would have predicted either of these things 20 years ago?', 'It\'s important for us to consider, too, in this election year some special characteristics that are important for us all to remember. I\'ve been listening to the Republican candidate. Then, you know, he\'s trying to wrap himself in the mantle of great Democratic Presidents. But it happens every election year. Here\'s what Franklin Roosevelt said back in 1944 about how Republicans change their tune at election time. I quote President Roosevelt: ""The whole purpose of Republican oratory these days seems to be to switch labels,"" he said. ""Now imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but I\'m afraid that in this case it\'s the most obvious common garden variety of fraud."" And now the Republicans have the nerve to quote Franklin Roosevelt himself.', 'John Kennedy predicted it back in 1960, when he said of the Republicans, and I quote John Kennedy, ""They\'re even beginning to say a few kind words about Franklin Roosevelt. Twenty years from now, they might even speak a good word for Harry Truman, but he won\'t say anything good about them."" [Laughter]', ""As you know that prediction has come true. And I predict that 20 years from now, Republican candidates might even be saying nice things about Jimmy Carter's second term."", ""For working families, there is a special message in this election. Five decades, 50 years, the Democrats have fought for the rights of working people. We enacted the minimum wage over Republican opposition. We enacted unemployment compensation over Republican opposition. We enacted social security over Republican opposition. We enacted laws that gave the right of people to form unions and participate in collective bargaining over the opposition of Republicans. In the last 3.5 years, we've fought together for common situs, for labor law reform, and against the repeal of Davis-Bacon—in each case over the opposition of Republicans."", 'My opponent\'s views are a matter of record. He described people drawing unemployment compensation as, and I quote, ""freeloaders wanting a prepaid vacation plan."" And last year when it was proposed that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration be abolished, that protects the safety and health of workers, his reply was, ""Amen."" This year he said, and I quote, ""The minimum wage has caused more misery and unemployment than anything since the Great Depression.""', ""These issues are extremely important. He says he wants to abolish the minimum wage, and if he can't do that, then, as he said in our debate, he wants to exempt young workers from the minimum wage. That would threaten the jobs of adults, as you know, who now rely on the minimum wage for protection, for a basic standard of decency with displacement by a new subclass of workers without the protection of the minimum wage. We Democrats oppose that. We've not lowered the minimum wage; we've raised it."", ""The man who said these things is proclaiming himself now a friend of the working families. He likes to put on a hard hat and quote Franklin Roosevelt. It's a new script, but to Republicans in election years, it's an old part. As you know, this is the candidate who is my opponent who says that the basis for the New Deal was fascism."", ""In an election year it's important for us to remember not just current events, not just the sharp differences that exist between two candidates—and the differences between myself and Governor Reagan are extremely sharp and accurately, now, defined—but the historical perspective of what our Nation is, what it has been, points very clearly to what it can be. You who are as old as I am, who remember the Great Depression years, the great changes that took place in our lives under Democrats, under Democratic leaders, have a clearer concept, perhaps, than some of our younger children, who haven't known those difficult days and seen a new life open up for us all."", 'Now I want to point out in final terms some special things about Poland. We have a good friendship with Poland. When I became President, my first [state]1 visit outside this Nation was to Poland. We have strong ties of understanding, and the connections which exist between families like you and the homeland of your ancestors or, perhaps, the homeland of you yourselves are very strong.', ""Recently I ordered quick approval of Poland's request for new credit guarantees for American grain. It was the largest such guarantee ever made by our country to any other nation. I wanted to demonstrate our admiration for the way the Polish nation is conducting itself in this time of change. I wanted to show our desire for better relations between our people, to strengthen even further the human ties between our two countries. The shipyard workers in Gdansk, the coal miners in Silesia, the store workers in Warsaw, have sent a powerful message around the world. Poland has reminded us that the desire for human rights and human dignity is universal. I want the people of Poland to know that we heard their message, that we observed and admired their courage. I want the people of Poland to know that the human rights in America is a commitment which is still alive and that we hold the banner of human rights high, as a nation with deep and unchanging commitments."", ""This morning I pledge to you that as long as I am President, this Nation will stand up for its beliefs, will stand up for our ideals, will stand up for our values, because my values, as President, are the same as yours. And in this last few days of the Presidential election of 1980, I'd like for you to think on those values, what they've meant to you in your lives, what you want them to mean to your children and your grandchildren, the historic thrust of our Nation, what it has been in the past and is now, what it can be in the future."", 'In many ways my political future is in your hands, but even more importantly, the political future of our Nation, its ties with Poland and with other ancestral countries that are so important to us-those ties that bind us together can be preserved by you. And I ask you in this next few days to make a sacrificial effort to show your commitment to our Nation, what it stands for, what it has been, and even more importantly, what it will be in the years ahead.', 'Thank you very much.

I think it's appropriate to say, Mr. Mayor, welcome to the new city of champions."", ""And also, I want to express my deep thanks to Ted Mann, not only for his warm introduction, but what he's meant to me in the last 4 years, expressing very clearly and sincerely and from the bottom of his heart the commitment to our own Nation's interests, our security interests, our interests in peace, stability in the world, humanitarian commitments which we share. The breadth of his understanding and the breadth of his commitments have been an inspiration to me as President."", ""Next Tuesday the American people will make a profound judgment. They will decide which candidate, which party, which philosophy will guide our great Nation, not only in the next 4 years but perhaps for the remaining years in this century. I cannot think of a more important choice. As I've said many times, it's not just a choice between two candidates or two parties, but between two futures, the future of your own lives, the lives of your family members, the lives of those you love, the life of those you love in other nations."", ""And I've come here this morning to ask you for your help between now and next Tuesday. You have a strong voice in your own community, and this group collectively and individually has a strong voice that can be heard in every community of this country. I'd like for your voice to spread the word that I give you this morning, on what is at stake for our country. I'd like for you to be side by side with me and with Fritz Mondale, your friend, as we lead the Democratic Party to victory on November 4th. I want you on my side because we believe, together, in those deepest values which epitomize the Democratic Party down through the years."", 'Three centuries ago a young English Quaker by the name of William Penn had a very prophetic notion. He believed that a people of diverse backgrounds and beliefs could live and could work together. He believed that a society might be founded on the basis of full freedom of conscience, where religious liberty would not only be protected but would be respected as well. His belief in tolerance was not some abstract formulation or some theoretical commitment. He had felt the weight of religious repression, he had seen the price of religious intolerance, and he was resolved to do something about it.', ""William Penn set a new standard to govern the New World. It's a standard and an ideal that we still respect. He said no men nor number of men on Earth has power or authority to rule over men's consciences in religious matters. It's my privilege to lead a party, a political party that has perfected this spirit of religious and cultural tolerance. The Democratic Party not only allows diversity; it embraces diversity."", ""We are not a rich man's party by any stretch of the imagination, but we are rich in our diversity, rich in representing the diversity which is America itself and the source of a great portion of our strength. The Democratic Party has always had room for East European Jews, for Italians, for Poles, for Irish, for blacks, even Baptists from the rural South. [Laughter]"", ""William Penn set a new standard to govern a New World, and it's a standard and an ideal that we still respect. We have a party that has fought and has had to fight for civil rights for minorities. We had to fight for them and have to fight today for equal rights for women. And the disturbing thing about civil rights and equal rights for women is that we've had to fight for them. It has not been a shared commitment by both parties."", 'Ours is a party that champions human rights abroad and faces opposition to this policy on the domestic political battlefield this year. The Democratic Party has fought for social justice because so many of us know too well the sting of social injustice.', ""We're a compassionate party because we can identify personally with those Americans who need help. We are a party that champions progressive causes because we ourselves have benefited from our Nation's social progress. We've come a long way together as a party and as a country, and we're going to go even further, because we are honest with ourselves about how far we have come and also how far we still have to go."", 'Recently a 12-year-old boy stood up in a town meeting that I was holding in Pittston here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. What he asked cuts to the very heart of intolerance, which has reared its head in this country just in recent weeks. His name was Avi Leiter, and here\'s what he said: ""In view of the fact that you, Mr. President, are Baptist, do you agree with the head of the churches who said God should not listen to Jewish prayers? I\'m a religious boy,"" he said, ""and I pray three times a day for the welfare of the Americans and the Jewish people. Do you think that God does not listen to my prayers?""', 'I told Avi that I believed God listens to his prayers just as I believe he listens to mine. I told him about being at Camp David with Prime Minister Begin and President Sadat. I told him that the world held little hope for peace when we secluded ourselves there, because those two nations had been torn by four wars in just 25 years.', 'And I told him that on the first day of our meetings, there was little on which we could agree, but we did agree to pray together. And we asked the entire world to join us in our prayers—a Jew, Moslem, and a Christian—and the world prayed with us. I told Avi that after 13 days we came out of Camp David with a peace agreement, and I told him that in my opinion that was proof enough, at least for me, that God heard all our prayers.', 'I bring this story up this morning, not to arouse emotions, but because it illustrates how far we still have to go in ridding our Nation of religious intolerance. It also illustrates how important it is for all of us to stand up for what we believe and to exercise our beliefs in the most tangible possible terms, within the limits of our constitutional rights, on election day and in our influence as we approach choice that will be made, to let people know what we believe in a loud and clear, unequivocal manner.', ""Today I want to outline for you my own position on a number of critical issues. I will be blunt, brief, to the point. It's time for us to look at the facts at the so-called bottom line."", 'First, the energy challenge. Before I took office, as you well know, our Nation did not even have an energy program, except one that had been forged under the Republicans by the oil companies themselves, working with the Arab OPEC nations, their partners. Three years after the Arab oil embargo, we were still trying to ignore the challenge that presented itself to our country. Most Americans were led to believe that there was not even an energy crisis at all. Two Republican administrations did little to correct this dangerous delusion.', ""This year, for the first time in history, we have an energy policy and we've actually reduced our dependence on foreign oil by 25 percent, 2 million barrels a day less than we have to buy from overseas. Congress has passed a historic synthetic fuels program and a windfall profits tax to pay for it. We're drilling more oil and gas wells than any time in our history. We're producing more coal this year than any time in history."", 'The bottom line is that the United States is today far less vulnerable to oil blackmail. Some of you may remember the Arab boycott against American businesses who traded with Israel, which we eliminated by law when I became President. We are much better able now to support our friends and to protect American ideals and principles and independence of friends like Israel, to stand up for what we believe.', 'Recently I signed with Minister Modal, in the Roosevelt Room at the White House, an agreement which Prime Minister Begin and I and President Sadat had all proposed jointly; that is, to .guarantee to Israel that if their supply of oil should be interrupted in the future or if they should be charged exorbitant prices for oil that would wreak an economic problem for them, then the United States would make up that oil supply. And that agreement extends for the next 14 years.', ""Look, on the other hand, at what the Republicans are offering: no conservation program at all. They even want to eliminate the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit. They want to throw out all or part of the windfall profits tax. They want us to rely solely on the oil companies to meet the energy challenge. And I think it's incumbent on you and me to think for a moment on who might be the next Secretary of Energy and who might be the next Secretary of State. The Republican bottom line: vulnerability, impotence in defending our friends and our principles."", ""Just for a few moments I'd like to talk specifically about Israel and the Jewish people. As Ted Mann pointed out, the United States has given aid to Israel since 1977 more than all previous administrations combined. The year before I became President, Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union was down to 14,000. Last year it was up to 50,000, the highest level in a decade, because we've put it as a top priority of my administration. And I have never met with President Brezhnev or with Gromyko and neither have the Secretaries of State of our Nation ever met with any Soviet leader that this question of Soviet Jews and their right to emigrate was not at the top of our list of agenda items."", 'And despite the fact that the Soviets have invaded Afghanistan, been condemned by the world, and that interruption of emigration has occurred, it is still higher now than it was when I took office. But we will not rest until every Soviet Jew who wants to leave the Soviet Union can do so.', ""Israel has been at war with Egypt, as you know, four times since 1948. Egypt is the strongest, most powerful, most influential of all Arab nations. Under my administration, Israel is at peace with this most powerful Arab neighbor. Today there are commercial flights between the two countries. The borders are open. They are cooperating on joint regional concerns, full diplomatic relations, Ambassadors assigned to represent each country in the other. There's tourism today, and today an Israeli tourist can buy the Jerusalem Post in the Cairo newsstands."", 'Just this week, the President of Israel paid a state visit, an official state visit, to Egypt. It was the first such visit by an Israeli head of state to any Arab country in history.', ""Let's talk just a moment, in closing, about American policy toward Israel."", 'Fact: The United States stands shoulder to shoulder with Israel against all her enemies, not as a favor to Israel, but as a direct investment in better peace and more security for our own Nation. We face these enemies whether they be a PLO terrorist carrying a bomb or a smooth-voiced diplomat at the United Nations.', 'Let me be very clear on one point: If there is any move to expel Israel from the United Nations, the United States will veto that action in the Security Council. And also, should Israel be deprived of its credentials in the General Assembly, through whatever means or whatever trick or procedure, I see no way whatever that the United States could continue its own participation in that body.', ""Referring to the PLO, let me say that the United States will never recognize nor negotiate with the PLO as long as it refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist and refuses to accept United Nations Resolution 242 as a basis for Mideast peace. The United States does not deal with organizations which try to accomplish their objectives by means of terrorism."", 'Terrorism is a crime against decency and humanity. We condemn it wherever it occurs, either on the streets of Pads or on the streets of Jerusalem, whether those responsible are neo-Nazis or members of the PLO.', ""And I think the most disturbing single incident that came up in the debate night before last was the fact, confirmed since the debate by the press, that the Republican candidate for President said that he thought it was none of the United States business if any other nation decides to develop nuclear weapons for themselves. Think for a moment what it would mean to our country, to Israel, or to other nations who might be subject to threats of terrorism, if some of Israel's neighbors or a country like Libya had an atomic bomb developed while the United States official policy was to look the other way."", ""The United States has a moral commitment to Israel because we share so many things in common. A strong, independent, democratic nation committed to peace in the Middle East is a major asset for our country, and we share these strategic understandings and consultations, looking toward the future. A strong Israel is not just in Israel's interest or the United States; it's in the interests of the entire free world."", ""Under my administration, as you well know, the United States has never used economic or military aid as a lever against Israel. We have never had a suspicion of a thought of doing this. We've not done it in the last 4 years. And we will never do it as long as there is a Democratic President in the Oval Office."", ""You remember in 1973 when Israel was in the throes of a war. The Republican administration announced quietly that we would reassess America's relationship with Israel. And in effect, there was a cutoff of arms and a freeze on relationships in an attempt to force Israel to succumb to the will of the Republican President. It's good for us to think on these things."", ""We are committed to the defense of Israel's security. We are also committed to defend its place in the world community. The United States will not permit Israel to be isolated. We are committed to the Camp David accords. We'll veto any change in the United Nations Resolution 242. We oppose the creation of an independent Palestinian state. And we will go even further: Whenever the United Nations is misused with malicious, unfair, and one-sided anti-Israeli resolutions, we will oppose them and we will veto them in the United Nations Security Council."", 'Your President and your country believes in an undivided Jerusalem. We believe, with Prime Minister Begin and, I might also add, President Sadat, that the future of Jerusalem will be decided, among all nations, through negotiations, negotiations whose conclusion must be confirmed with the concurrence and the agreement of the Government of Israel.', ""You in this city need to remember one other point. You're concerned about Israel's neighbors, and so are we. It's good for our country to have friendly relationships with the moderate Arab countries. In 1978 Secretary Harold Brown assured the Congress that our country would not provide Saudi Arabia F-15 offensive equipment, equipment that would give them an offensive capability against Israel. That assurance stands today."", ""Let me say in closing that you live in a city dedicated to tolerance. You're a city that, because of that, has remembered the Holocaust. You've erected a monument to 6 million martyrs. I'm proud to say that under my administration, with the help of Ted Mann, Ed Koch, and others, the United States Government has set into motion the development of a similar national memorial. That's what the Holocaust Commission will do. It will design a suitable memorial to this historic crime, and we will study the constant memory of its victims."", ""But the greatest memorial that I'm committed to offer is an active one. It is our unflagging, constant, untiring support of the results of the world's abhorrence of the Holocaust, and that is the formation, the protection, and the perpetuation of a strong and free state of Israel."", ""I feel deeply that you and I share many beliefs and commitments, a permanent commitment to human rights, a commit. ment to progress, to humanitarian action, commitments to the deprived, to those who are persecuted, to those who are in the minority, to those who need a strong voice and don't have the numbers to exert their voice, to the protection of new. comers, haven for refugees, commitment to peace, a sacred conviction that an affront to just one person's belief is an affront to all humanity. And I pledge to you that as long as I am President of the United States, that commitment which you and I share will be kept."", 'Thank you very much.']"
75,Jimmy Carter ,"October 30, 1980","[""Thank you very much, my good friend, Chick Chaikin. I am proud to be in the heart of the greatest city on Earth, New York. I love New York and I love all of you. New York's heart is a big heart, and it's also a Democratic heart. Right? [Cheers] This is the State and the city that gave us Al Smith and the greatest President of the 20th century, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and the Governors like Herbert Lehmann and Averell Harriman, and United States Senators like Robert Wagner, Sr., and Robert Kennedy, and mayors like Robert Wagner, Jr., and Abe Beame. And I'm proud to be here with the inheritors of that great Democratic tradition, your courageous Governor, Hugh Carey, your outspoken, fighting mayor, Ed Koch—how am I doing, Ed?—your wise and your humane Lieutenant Governor, my friend Mario Cuomo, and your brilliant United States Senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and your next United States Senator, Liz Holtzman."", ""Today we're together, we're determined, and we are united. And next Tuesday we're going to whip the Republicans like they've never been whipped before. It's up to you and me together to roll up a Democratic victory from Staten Island to Niagara Falls and all across this land. The lines are sharply drawn. The choice is crucial, and especially for New Yorkers. If you ride the bus or the subway, then you know how Governor Reagan used to pray every day that the Nation would never extend a helping hand to New York."", 'I\'m sure the Lord heard that prayer, as he hears all prayers, but after due consideration and with a little help from below, he decided to answer some other prayers instead—that is, mine and yours, to revitalize New York. And that\'s what we\'ve done together. Here\'s something else that Mr. Reagan said. Quote: ""Real Americans,"" he said, ""just plain don\'t like New York."" All right, how many of you are real Americans? [Cheers] How many of you love New York? [Cheers] That\'s right. I\'ve got real news for Mr. Reagan. There are some real Americans here on Seventh Avenue, from Manhattan and Brooklyn and Queens and the Bronx and Staten Island, and from Georgia, who just plain don\'t like Republicans.', 'And here\'s something else that my Republican opponent said about our cities. Just a few months ago he said, and I quote again, ""Urban aid programs are one of the biggest phonies that we have in this system."" I disagree. I think urban aid programs are one of the biggest necessities we have in this system. In 1978, down in city hall, I stood with Hugh Carey, Ed Koch, Pat Moynihan, and I signed a bill granting $1.6 billion in loan guarantees for New York City. It hasn\'t cost our Nation a dime, because New York is a great city, growing, strong, prosperous, with a bright future ahead of all of you. Under the new Urban Development Action Grant program, New York has received more grants than any other city in the Nation. We\'ve put $600 million into economic development for New York, for community development. We changed the formula that determines how much money is allotted. It was a tough fight, but we won it together. And the result is that the city is getting an extra $110 million a year, and now we\'re fighting to change the formula to give you that kind of benefit for your mass transit program.', ""But urban America is just one of the areas of crucial choice, and in just a few minutes, I'd like to outline for you a few key basic issues that separate me from my Republican opponent. On one side, you've got a Republican candidate who promises ideological loyalty tests for possible Federal judges, including members of the Supreme Court. On the other side, you've got a Democratic administration pledged to an independent qualified judiciary. I've been faithful to that pledge, as you know, for the last 4 years, and I will remain faithful to it if and when I'm called upon to appoint members of the United States Supreme Court."", 'Another basic issue. On one side is a Republican candidate who launched his political career as a traveling salesman for the anti-Medicare lobby. Now he says, and I quote, ""I am firmly opposed to national health insurance."" On the other side, you\'ve got a Democratic administration committed to the enactment of national health insurance. And I\'ll work with Senator Kennedy, with Pat Moynihan, and your congressional delegation and other Democrats around this land to give the $200,000 burden a lift off the shoulders of New York that now costs you for Medicaid and make sure that the taxpayers of New York have the break that you deserve and that you will get under a Democratic administration.', ""And there's another basic issue I'd like to mention. On one side, you've got a Republican candidate who's turned his back on 40 years of support for the equal rights amendment. And on the other side, you've got a Democratic administration and a Democratic President who has pledged to fight for the rights of women, like the rights of men, and inscribe them in the Constitution of the United States with the equal rights amendment."", ""And there's another basic issue. On one side, you've got a Republican candidate who said this year—listen to this—that the minimum wage has caused more unemployment than anything since the Great Depression. He's on record this year as favoring the abolition of the minimum wage, and if he can't abolish it, then he wants to lower it by the backdoor route of a so-called subminimum wage for minority and other young people. That's what he proposed during the debate just this week. On the other side, you've got a Democratic administration that supports the minimum wage, just as Democrats have supported it against Republican opposition ever since Franklin D. Roosevelt first got it enacted, when it was only 25 cents an hour, and the Republicans were against giving working men and women 25 cents an hour for their hard labor."", ""We Democrats know that the minimum wage has given a decent life and made it possible for millions of Americans. We Democrats know that it's wrong to tell a 25- or 30-year-old mother or father that he or she can't have a job because it's been filled by someone who's being paid a special sub-minimum and sub-standard wage. We Democrats raised the minimum wage, not lowered it, and that's a basic difference between me and my Republican administration [opponent]."", 'There is another basic difference. On one side, you\'ve got a Republican candidate who says, and I quote again, ""What needs to be done for the government is to repeal the energy legislation we\'ve passed and turn the oil industry loose."" And on the other side, you\'ve got a Democratic administration that fought successfully for the windfall profits tax and for the massive new energy program that has already reduced our oil imports by one-third compared to what it was only 12 months ago.', 'Every drop of oil that we do not have to buy from OPEC increases our economic security and our national security. We must not allow our progress to be reversed by letting a Republican back in the White House.', 'Let me mention one other basic issue, and Governor Reagan says that this is the foundation of his economic program. On one side is a Republican candidate who bases his entire program on Reagan-Kemp-Roth—a massive tax cut for the rich huge increases in defense spending, and a balanced budget all at once. His own running mate, George Bush, said that this would cause a 30-percent inflation rate. He called it ""voodoo economics.""', ""Many of you read Business Week magazine. It's hardly a Democratic publication. And here's what Business Week said about Reagan-Kemp-Roth, the foundation for Governor Reagan's economic program. Business Week said it's completely irresponsible, it will touch off an inflationary explosion that would wreck this country and impoverish everyone on a fixed income. That's what Business Week thinks about Governor Reagan's economic program."", ""We Democrats know that unemployment is still too high, but in America today a higher percentage of our people have jobs than ever before in history. We've created almost 9 million new jobs, and 200,000 of those jobs are right here in the New York metropolitan area. Unemployment here is down 22 percent since the day I was inaugurated President."", ""Most of all, there's another basic issue that you ought to be reminded of every day, and that is that we Democrats dare to fight for peace, and the Republican candidate for President is utterly without any foreign policy experience. He has repeatedly called for us to send American military forces to intervene in trouble spots around the world. In 1975 he called for the use of American military forces in Ecuador in a fishing dispute; later, in Angola; in 1976, in Rhodesia and Cyprus. This year, so far, he's called for the use of American military forces in Cuba, in Pakistan, and in the Middle East. Let's make sure that we don't have to find out whether he'll call for the use of American military forces next year by sending him back to Hollywood and California, where the American military forces won't listen to his voice."", ""As you know, the American Democratic administration has kept this Nation strong and also kept this Nation at peace, and we have extended American peaceful inclinations and influence to other troubled areas around the world. That's what we did in the Middle East, where we helped bring a treaty of peace between Israel and Egypt, the first ever peace between Israel and one of her Arab neighbors."", ""The Democratic Party is committed, and I am committed, to a strong and secure Israel, an Israel safe from the threats of terrorism, an Israel that has a strong strategic partner in the United States. Let there be no mistake about it, the Democratic Party and this Democratic President have stood by Israel's side for 32 years, and we always will."", ""And there's something else we Democrats stand for, and that's basic human rights. America should always stand for human liberty and human dignity. As long as I'm President, we will hold high the banner of human rights."", 'Now, let me touch on one final basic issue, the most important issue of all. The Republican candidate says that the best approach to nuclear arms negotiations would be to threaten the possibility of an arms race. The possibility of a nuclear arms race is what the Republican candidate proposes. We Democrats disagree. We\'re committed to mutual and balanced controls on the terrible weapons of nuclear annihilation. I consider this to be the overriding issue of this campaign. The New York Times of February 1st, 1980, reported this about Governor Reagan and his attitude toward letting other nations have atomic bombs. Think for a moment what it would mean to us and to Israel and other peace-loving nations if Libya and other terrorist governments had the atomic bomb. All Presidents in the past have tried to prevent the extension of nuclear explosives from going to these kinds of nations. This is what the New York Times said: ""Governor Reagan indicated today that he believes the United States should not stand in the way of countries developing their own nuclear weapons, saying, \'I just don\'t think it\'s any of our business.\'""', ""Over the last 20 years, we've taken the first long step away from the nuclear precipice. We must stay on that road until the shadow of a nuclear holocaust is lifted from the people of this Earth. On issue after issue, the choice is clear, and the stakes for our country are very high. This is a tough race. It's going right down to the wire. The Republicans are out-spending us by millions of dollars."", ""Fritz Mondale and I are going to need the help of every one of you. New York is absolutely vital to our victory. For the sake of everything that we've done together in the past, for the sake of everything the Democratic Party has meant to you, to New York City, to New York State and this Nation, for the sake of everything we're pledged to do together in the future to give us a strong and peaceful nation, let's win a victory not just for Jimmy Carter and Fritz Mondale, but for the whole Democratic Party and the whole Democratic ticket and, most important of all, for the beliefs and the conviction and the ideals we share."", 'Will you help me next Tuesday? [Applause and cheers] Are we going to have a great victory next Tuesday? [Applause and cheers]', 'Thank you very much. God bless all of you.']"

Amy's just fine."", ""As you may know, Plains, Georgia, has a lot in common with you. We are both very close to 1-75. I think I'll just move up and stay with you all for a while. So, if you want to see Amy in 1986, just get on 1-75 and come on down to Plains. We'll be there."", ""Let me say first of all, Senator Riegle, Senator Levin, Congressman Bob Traxler, who introduced me so well, Congressman Albosta, Congressman Dale Kildee, and all of you, my friends, it's a great pleasure to be with you.

And I go from here to St. Louis, Missouri, and tonight I'll be in South Carolina, right, and tomorrow in Florida and Texas. And I'll wind up the last day of the campaign on the west coast, in California and in Oregon and Washington, and I'll be back in Plains to vote on Tuesday. And Tuesday, I want to tell you that I'll be looking to this area of Michigan and the State of Michigan and the Nation to give use a tremendous victory over the Republicans. Okay? [Applause]"", ""This afternoon I want to talk to you about a few things that are quite serious to me and to you, to your families, to the people that you love, and to the nation about which you care so deeply. This is troubled times in many places of the world, and we've been faced with many very serious challenges in the last 4 years. But Democrats are builders, just as the people of Michigan and the workers of our automobile industry are builders. We have never been afraid to face change. We have never been afraid to face any question; we've never failed to answer it. We've never faced any challenge that we could not meet; we've never faced any problem we could not solve; we've never faced any obstacle we could not overcome. Americans are like that, we are builders. Democrats are builders. That's why you and I are Democrats. That's why we're going to win next week."", ""In recent weeks, I've had a chance to travel around this country to see what is going on in America. One of the things I've seen that has thrilled my heart: I've seen the best, the most durable, the safest, the most fuel-efficient automobiles in the world rolling off the assembly lines in Michigan. And they're going to replace those foreign cars on the market, and you can depend on that. And as you well know, they're built by the best automobile workers in the world, right?"", ""We have faced rapidly changing times because last year, in 1979, the OPEC oil companies and countries increased the price of oil more than the oil prices had increased since it was first discovered in the 1800's. Our Nation changed its buying habits and very quickly the automobile industry of our country—the automobile workers, management—and government got together to plan for the future. The new cars now being assembled in this Nation are the highest quality of all. And, as you know, there are long waiting lists for the new model cars. This change has been a traumatic experience for some of us, for you and for me. As President, I have felt a personal responsibility to play a leading role in shaping the future of the automobile industry."", ""One of the things that we have done is to spell out the very clear new tax incentives to encourage reinvestment by saved tax monies into modern tools and plants so that the American workers can continue to be the most productive in the world. We've worked out a very good relationship now between the Environmental Protection Agency and the automobile industry, so that we could understand one another and work in harmony to continue the progress that has been made."", ""We've obviously had to deal with temporary unemployment. We have been true to the principles of the Democratic Party in making sure that unemployment compensation was paid to workers when they are unemployed because of a changed desire and the changing models. This is quite in contrast to my Republican opponent who says that unemployment compensation is a prepaid vacation for freeloaders."", ""Throughout this campaign, for the last 4 years, we have said that it's important for our Nation to be strong, vibrant, and dynamic in meeting inevitable change. We've had some tough and historic obstacles, but I promise you this, as long as I am President, the Government of the United States will play its rightful role in making American cars the cars of the future. I believe in that goal, and with your help, we'll carry it out."", ""We've backed up Chrysler when they needed help most. We've backed them up with $1 1/2 billion in sound loan guarantees. We've backed up a 100,000 Chrysler workers, and we've backed up a total of 250,000 other employees in the automobile industry in this Nation who depend upon Chrysler being a viable organization for their livelihood. And because we did, there's a K-car today, 40,000 back orders for it. Chrysler's building fuel-efficient automobiles, and Chrysler's building for the future."", 'Again there was a sharp difference shown between the basic philosophy of the Democratic Party, that I\'ve just outlined to you, and the attitude of my own opponent who represents the Republican Party, who, when faced earlier this year with the question of guaranteed loans for Chrysler, said, and I quote him, ""What\'s wrong with bankruptcy?""', ""I feel this direct responsibility to expedite the ITC determination about how imports are affecting the automobile industry, and after this election is over, I will continue my efforts along those lines. When I was in Venice in May, I met with the Japanese leaders there, their Foreign Minister, and I expressed the great concern that I had about alleged plans in Japan to expand their automobile capacity. They've now assured me and they have urged their manufacturers to exercise prudence and predict a decline in their exports to the United States in the final months of this year."", 'The last time I was in Michigan, I said I was going to talk to the Japanese about their automobile exports to this country. And I can announce today that I will be meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister soon after the election to discuss the automobile issue and a whole range of other issues of importance to their country and to our own.', ""It's good for you to remember—many of you are young—to remember what is so important about the basic philosophy of our two parties down through the years. I grew up as a young boy on a farm during the Depression years. I was born in 1924. And the Depression years saw a great change in our life. We faced a life of despair. We didn't have electricity on our farm. There was no guarantee of an equitable payment for hard work done."", ""The Democrats proposed the REA to put electricity on the farms. Republicans opposed it. The Democrats felt that there should be an end to sweatshops and that grown men and women should have a chance to earn enough with 'their honest labor to feed and to clothe and to house their family. So, the Democrats put forward the idea of a minimum wage, 25 cents an hour. The Republicans opposed it. Later the Democrats raised it."", 'When I finished high school, I got my first job—40 cents an hour. That increase from 25 cents to 40 cents was supported by the Democrats. The Republicans said it was socialism and the unwarranted injection of the government into the affairs of the private enterprise system. Later, of course, Roosevelt thought that the older people in our country ought to have some security in their old age. So, the Democrats put forward the idea of social security. The Republicans opposed it.', 'Years later, under a Democratic administration, it was proposed that we have Medicare to give our retired citizens some modicum of health care. The Republicans opposed it. Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, got his start in political life working for the American Medical Association, traveling around this country speaking against Medicare, calling it socialized medicine and the injection of socialism into the system of our country.', 'The Government has a proper role to play in helping people have a better life. The Democratic government philosophy has always been that government ought to take people who want to work for themselves, stand on their own feet, have a better life, have self-respect, have better health care, have better education, and give them a boost to be more self-sufficient, to take whatever talent or ability God might have given that individual person and let that talent and ability be expanded. Education programs, public education has always been supported strongly by Democrats, as you well know.', ""There's a basic difference in philosophy that still permeates the consciousness of Americans on both parties and the two candidates running for President this year. I reject the negative approach. I know that the American people will reject it too. And I come today to you to offer you a choice, and the clearest possible choice, about our Nation's future."", 'For decades Walter Reuther and the United Automobile Workers stood with Harry Truman and with John Kennedy and with Lyndon Johnson. They fought for Medicare. They fought for national health insurance. Ronald Reagan called that socialism, again. He ridiculed Walter Reuther for proposing, and I quote, ""socialized medicine."" Governor Reagan can call this dream whatever he wants, but we\'re going to make it a reality.', ""This time we're going to make good on all the promises that Harry Truman and Walter Reuther and John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson and Franklin Roosevelt were fighting for. This time we're going to realize our dream. With the help of those assembled behind me, who are serving in the Congress, we're going to reach that dream and make national health insurance a reality, because what it will do for us is to give us a chance to prevent disease. It'll give us a chance to control hospital costs. It'll give us a chance to emphasize at-home care and outpatient care, not the incarceration for long periods in a hospital as the only way to get adequate medical care. It'll give us catastrophic health insurance. If a family's wiped out financially by high medical costs, the insurance will help pay for it. It'll give special care to women, pregnant women and newborn babies during the first few months or years of their lives. This is the kind of thing that must be done."", ""On one side in this campaign you've got a Republican candidate who's turned his back on 40 years of commitment, his own party's commitment, to the equal rights amendment. Six predecessors of mine in the Oval Office have believed that there must be a guarantee for the rights of women, like the rights of men, inscribed in the Constitution of the United States. This is not a radical proposal. What it says, very simply, is this: that equality of rights cannot be abridged for women by the Federal Government or the government of any State. That's it. That's it in its totality, and that's what we mean when we say we're going to give equal rights."", ""On one side is a Republican candidate who's repeatedly called for sending American military forces to troublespots around the world. In 1975, Governor Reagan—[Interruption from the audience.]"", ""Okay, listen, and I'll talk. In 1975 Governor Reagan wanted to send American military forces to Ecuador and to Angola. In 1976 he said let's send military forces to Rhodesia and Cyprus. This year, so far, he's wanted to send American military forces to Cuba, to Pakistan, and the Middle East. On the other side, you've got an experienced Democratic administration which has strengthened our Nation's defenses. It's strengthened our Nation's alliances, and it's built a new and a fruitful relationship with one-fourth the total population of the world, in China, and doubled our trade in the meantime with the people of Taiwan."", ""We've been interested in having peace for ourselves, yes. But we have also used our peaceful influence to help other people around the world, including, of course, the Israelis and the Egyptians, and now we're trying to extend that peace to Israel's other neighbors. This is the kind of commitment that the Democrats have exemplified down through the ages."", ""On one side is a Republican candidate who's criticized our human rights policy as being against the best interests of the United States. When I spoke this morning to the Polish Americans, I had Mr. Walesa with me, the father of the labor leader in Poland, who has hammered out in that country a new approach and a new dream of the rights of Polish workers. And I told the Polish Americans this morning that as long as I'm President of our country, we will hold high the banner of human rights."", ""I've outlined to you a few issues that I think are very important, because there is a sharp distinction between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, and between the two candidates who represent those parties this year. The other thing, though, is perhaps even more important of all: On one side, you've got a Republican candidate who says in this year, 1980, in a time of growing concern about nations like Iraq or Libya, terrorist nations, that they might be developing nuclear weapons, that nuclear proliferation, as Governor Reagan says, is none of our business."", ""On the other side, you've got a Democratic administration pledged to halting the dangerous spread of nuclear weapons to the nations that do not now have them, nations that might be highly unstable and irresponsible. That's the business not only of everyone in government in the United States but of every government and of every human being on Earth. The most important single commitment that a President can have is to keep our Nation strong, yes, but at peace, and to control the horrible possible blight of atomic weapons that threatens this world."", ""I mentioned to you the other night on television that one nuclear warhead on one of our major missiles has about 10 megatons of explosive power. I'd like to remind you again what that means. If you put 50 tons of TNT in every railroad car—50 tons—it would stretch 2,500 miles long and take a thousand diesel locomotives to move it. That's just one warhead, and we've got literally hundreds of equivalent warheads to that explosive power. To control that terrible destructive force has been the preeminent commitment of every President, Democratic or Republican, since Harry Truman."", ""Governor Reagan would abandon that commitment, a treaty negotiated under three Presidents—two Republicans and myself—over a 7-year period to have a balanced, controlled, confirmable agreement with the concept of lowering the arsenals in both nations. Governor Reagan said recently the one thing that's been missing from the nuclear arms negotiations is a nuclear arms race. I hope you'll remember that if you forget everything else I'll say this afternoon, because it is the most important single issue."", ""Two other points and then I'd like to be coming to a close. Two other points. On one side you've got a Republican Presidential candidate who said this year that the minimum wage has caused more unemployment and more misery than anything since the Great Depression. He's on record this year as favoring the abolition of the minimum wage. If he can't abolish it he plans to lower it by the backdoor route of a so-called subminimum wage for minority or other youth. That's what he proposed during the debate night before last. On the other side you've got a Democratic administration carrying on the tradition of strengthening the minimum wage, just as Democrats have supported and strengthened that commitment to the lowest paid, hard-working American families ever since Franklin Roosevelt. We know that the minimum wage has made a decent life possible for millions of Americans, and we Democrats know it's wrong to tell a 25- or a 35-yearold man or woman, a mother or father, that he or she can no longer have a job because it's been filled by someone much younger who's working for substandard wages. This is extremely important to me and to the working people of our country."", ""And finally, let me say that I'm a farmer. My people have lived in this country for a long time. All of my ancestors-my father, my grandfather, and others—have been farmers. One of the greatest commitments that I've made as President is to strengthen the life and the economy of farmers, ranchers in this Nation. Under my own administration, in spite of very severe blows, as you know, on a worldwide basis, we've had the highest gross income for farmers, the highest net income for farm families, the highest exports in history. As a matter of fact, this year, in spite of restraints on sales to the Soviet Union after they invaded Afghanistan, we will sell overseas to permanent customers $40 billion worth of American agricultural products, an $8 billion increase over last year, the largest single increase in history. And when we developed our farm program in 1977 we did it with the closest possible cooperation of farmers themselves and of organizations representing them."", 'If you\'ve been listening to the Republican candidate, then you know he\'s trying to wrap himself in the mantle of great Democratic Presidents. But it happens every election year. Here\'s what Franklin Roosevelt said back in 1944 about how Republicans change their tune at election time. ""The sole purpose of Republican oratory these days,"" he said, ""seems to be to switch labels. Now, imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but I\'m afraid in this case it\'s the most obvious, common, garden variety of fraud."" And now the Republicans have the nerve to quote Franklin Roosevelt himself.', 'John Kennedy predicted it back in 1960, when he said of the Republicans, ""They are even beginning to say a few kind words about Franklin Roosevelt. Twenty years from now, who knows. They might even speak a good word for Harry Truman. But he won\'t ever say a good word about them."" [Laughter] As you know, that prediction came true. And I predict that 20 years from now Republican candidates will even be saying good things about Jimmy Carter\'s second term, if you will let me.', ""Well, in closing let me say that I've described the election of 1980 as the choice between two futures as quickly and as briefly as I can, covering a fairly broad range of issues. Here's what I see in the future that we are fighting for together. I see a nation strong and at peace. I see a nation secure in its pursuit of progress, equity, and justice for our people, a nation where everyone can have the dignity of a decent job, where new industries create a new generation of American buildings and vehicles that will house and move us in comfort on a lot less energy, and that energy coming from America, a nation where children are educated to their maximum potential, where the elderly are treated with the respect that they have earned, where families are intact, loving and secure. I have a vision of a nation free enough to attract and strong enough to welcome the deprived from other parts of the world as we have welcomed the Jews from Eastern Europe and the immigrants here from Germany and from Poland and from Italy and from other nations from which almost all of us have come, a nation of liberty and of justice and of compassion and of concern, a nation of confidence, a nation of commitment, a nation of unity, a nation of strength."", ""I need your help to make this vision a reality. Together you and I can make the greatest nation on Earth even greater in the future. That's my pledge. Will you help me? [Cheers] Thank you very much. I need you to work now. Okay?

Every President since World War II has sought agreement to limit nuclear arms—the test ban treaty under President Kennedy, the antiballistic missile treaty under President Nixon, the Vladivostok accords under President Ford, the nuclear arms limitation agreement negotiated over 7 years by my two predecessors and myself. Governor Reagan has never supported a single one of these agreements. Instead, he proposes to tear up the existing agreement and threaten a massive new arms race.', 'And he also says that when other countries like Libya try to develop their own nuclear weapons, that it\'s none of our business. During the debate this week, he flatly denied that he had ever said that. Yet the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Washington Star all reported what he said.

This week we've seen him make some similar shifts."", ""All this year he made it crystal clear that he opposes the minimum wage, he wants it repealed. This week in the debate he tried to shift his position again. He still wants to undercut the protections of the minimum wage, but he's found a new way to go about it, by exempting millions of young workers from its coverage, by exposing millions of more workers to a new form of competition from a new subclass of workers working at substandard wages."", ""Let's look at what Governor Reagan is saying about social security this week. For years he had a habit of suggesting that the system be made voluntary. Now he denies this. Now he says, as he said in the debate this week, that social security is a bad investment for young people. That is absolutely untrue. In fact, a typical married worker with dependents, starting out this year at the age of 22, would get back 3 1/2 times more than they pay in and at the same time be covered for disability. And if the husband should die, the wife and the children would be covered, as you know, until the children reach the age of 18. That's an outstanding investment for Americans, and it's been the foundation of security for our people."", ""For years Governor Reagan opposed Medicare. He started in politics as a traveling salesman for the anti-Medicare lobby. All across this country he said that Medicare was socialism. That should not be too surprising. After all, he's the same person who said that the New Deal was based on fascism, who said that the minimum wage was the main cause of unemployment, who said that trees are the number one cause of air pollution.

If just a few more people, a few more Democrats had gone to the polls in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President; Richard Nixon would never have served in the Oval Office.', 'And you in Missouri remember vividly how close the election was in 1948. If just a few Democrats, a few members of labor unions, a few students who were enlightened about the future, a few aged who were concerned about social security, a few working families who were interested in the minimum wage, had not gone to the polls in 1948, then Harry Truman would never have served his term as a President of this country.', ""I say, let's go on building a partnership, to stay strong, to stay secure, to raise high the banner of human rights and to keep our Nation at peace.

And we got home after sundown, and then had to pump water and feed the livestock before we went to bed that night quite early. We had a battery radio—that was it—to keep track of the outside world.

I served on a local school board, went on there in 1954 and went off in 1962. It was worse than being President. [Laughter] Tough years."", 'A lot of you remember it, because the Governors and the State legislators and others right then didn\'t want to touch school integration. And the school board members had to do it. And when it was HEW saying, ""Do it,"" a lot of southern white people didn\'t do it. But when the Federal courts and the Constitution of the United States was put before us, as is the case with the southern character, we revered our Constitution, and we complied with the law that transformed our life for the better. And it opened up a new era for the Southland.', ""My service there on the local government taught me a lot about what needed to be done, and I ran for the State senate, because I wanted to continue some progress in Georgia to have a better school system. You all had a better one than we did when I was elected to the State senate. And when I got to the State senate, I only wanted one assignment. And that was to be put on the education committee, because I saw that as the biggest challenge for the South, to give our young people's minds a chance to grow and to develop and to give our children a better chance in life than we had had, even, and to see the grandchildren come along even better. And I served on the education committee; I was the secretary of it, and I was chairman of the university committee in the Georgia senate, served two terms, then ran for Governor."", ""I was defeated in 1966. I was a newcomer to statewide politics; nobody knew who I was. I came close, but I was defeated. I learned a lot out of that defeat. I went around the State of Georgia for 4 years. I shook hands with 600,000 people. My wife went one direction, I went another. I learned a lot about politics. And I learned to tie my own political future with a direct contact between me and an individual voter. And I went to the voters who quite often felt that they didn't have a chance to let their voices be heard. And then I became Governor and served along with John West and other great southerners and people from all over the country, and got—to know about this Nation. And then, of course, I was elected President."", ""But I've had a chance as a school board member, as a State senator, as a Governor, as your neighbor, as a President to see the necessity for a partnership, not just between the Federal, State, and local governments but among organizations that represent people outside of government, and among those individual human beings in this Nation who ought to be part of and who are part of the history, the present, and the future development of our country."", ""I've won some political victories that people didn't think I could win. I was not predicted to win in 1976, as you know. South Carolina gave me a great victory here, and it was crucial in the very close election between myself and an incumbent President, Gerald Ford, who had repaired the damage that Richard Nixon and Watergate had done. A lot of people felt obligated to him because he had done a good job. And it was a difficult thing, but I think the overriding feeling in that '76 election was the choice between what the Democratic Party stands for and what the Republican Party stands for. It doesn't change much."", ""You can go back during those years that I described to you earlier. The Republicans .were against social security. The Republicans said that REA was a socialist plot to inject the Federal Government into the private enterprise system of this country. When the Democrats put forward a 25-cent minimum wage, Republicans were against it. They said that a grown man and a grown woman trying to feed children and pay rent, buy food, wasn't worth 25 cents an hour. I got out of high school in '41. My first job was working for the government, measuring land 10 hours a day, 40 cents an hour. I had to furnish my own car and pay the expenses. But that was a lot of money for me, $28 a week, I got. That was the minimum wage then. Republicans were against the 40-cent minimum wage. It hasn't changed much. Medicare, a program that provided older people with a modicum, at least, of health care: Democrats put it forward; Republicans were against it."", 'The South is looked upon as a conservative region of the Nation, and I don\'t disparage the word ""conservative,"" because conservative in a way means to conserve precious things. But the connotation of conservative to mean the preservation of power and the deprivation of equality of opportunity is something that I turn against.', ""The South's been always interested in a strong defense—always. Whenever our Nation's been tested in war, the battleground casualty figures and those lost in prison camps have always shown that the South came forward, quick, patriotically, and first. But at the same time we know the value of peace. No part of the Nation has suffered so much from the ravages of war as Georgia and South Carolina. But we know that the preservation of peace is dependent on strength not only strength militarily but strength of character, unity, confidence, respect for one another. And I got elected President because the Nation was ready to change."", ""The last President from the Deep South was James Polk, who was elected in 1844, and between 1844 and 1976, there was not a chance for anyone from the Deep South to be elected President. But the country's changed, and I think there's now a realization that we're one nation and that some of the things that have stirred in the South—progress, technology, better education, more equality, harmony, friendship among people who are different-has been an inspiration to the rest of the country."", 'Well, next Tuesday the Nation will make a decision about who will lead our country the next 4 years, yes, between two men, between two parties, but also between two futures. And I hope that this next few days you\'ll think back on our past, blacks and whites, what we\'ve done together, what the Democratic Party\'s meant to us. Our country\'s at peace. It\'s been 50 years since a President could stand before any audience and say, ""We haven\'t had a war since I\'ve been in the White House."" And I hope we can go 4 more years, through strength, keep our Nation at peace.', ""So, to conclude my rambling remarks, I'd like to say this: I've come here as a friend and as a neighbor, kin to some of you, to ask you for your help, because the election is going to be very close. And I believe that the issues at stake are important to you, important to your family, to those you love, and to those who look to you for leadership. You've been invited here to the Governor's Mansion because you are leaders. And there's no one in this group that can't reach 500 or a thousand people, maybe even 10,000 people through the radio and so forth between now and November the 4th, next Tuesday."", ""And I'd like to ask you as a special favor, as a neighbor, as a southerner, as an incumbent President, as a Democrat, as a friend, to go a second mile for me this last few days. It's important that I and the Democratic candidates who are running with me on the same ticket in South Carolina be elected. We'll try to continue the heritage that's made us a great part of the world. We'll try to bind ourselves closer together in the spirit of common belief in liberty, in freedom, in human rights, in respect for one another, in the characteristics of which I'm very proud as an American."", 'Thank you very much.']"
79,Jimmy Carter ,"October 31, 1980","[""First of all let me express my thanks to Senator Lawton Chiles, to Governor Bob Graham, Ambassador Askew, Congressman Allen, Mayor Oldham, and all the mayors who've come here from the surrounding territories. And from the bottom of my heart let me thank my neighbors, the Floridians, who gave me an overwhelming victory in '76 twice, early this spring, and who are going to give me a big victory on November the 4th over Ronald Reagan."", ""As you know, in the last 4 years I've been to a lot of places, and I've seen a lot of people. But I just want to say how great it is for me to be back down here in the South, at home, where I belong and where I'll be in 1985."", ""I grew up on a farm in south Georgia not far from the Florida line, and I've never forgotten those early values that were important to me—hard work, self-sacrifice, trust in our families, closeness with our neighbors, and trust in our God. And I pray that we in the South and the people of this Nation will never get away from those ideals and commitments which although other things change, those ideals and commitments never change."", ""Most of you have the same background, the same kind of families, the same kind of upbringing that I have had in my own life. You share with me the values and my love of this country. It was you who put me on the road to the highest honor that any American can have, to serve as your President. It was you, the people of Florida, who launched my campaign in 1975 and 1976, who kept me on the road early this year, in the spring, when I had a tough opposition. It's you who stood with me all the time in the past. You've got a great political tradition of supporting Jimmy Carter. We are people of traditions. Let's don't change it. Okay? [Applause]"", ""I want to be frank and honest with you. I've come back to my part of this country to ask you to join with me once again in a great and a noble campaign. It's a campaign for peace. It's a campaign for jobs. It's a campaign for a secure and prosperous and progressive and united future for the country that we love. Without your help I cannot win. If the election were held today, the issue would be very much in doubt. It's a close election."", ""Throughout the Nation—and as you know it's a close election in Florida itself-we must not allow a defeat for the Democratic Party, its candidates, and for all we stand for. There's too much at stake. This is not just a matter of personality between myself and Governor Reagan. It's not just an issue of whether or not a Democrat sits in the Oval Office. The question is, are we going to finish the work we've begun on energy security, on revitalizing our economy, on an effective, steady, carefully planned rebuilding of our Nation's military forces, on peace for our country, on peace for the Middle East, and on control of the most powerful weapon that ever has been known or envisioned in the history of mankind?"", ""I have confidence in the American people, and I have confidence in their judgment. I have confidence in you. When it comes down to a time of decision, when you go into the voting booth next Tuesday, Americans will choose wisely. They will choose continuity. They'll choose to get on with the job that we've set for ourselves."", 'Many questions have been raised in this campaign. The hardest questions of all is the one American people must ask yourselves: Who should serve in the Oval Office? Who should hold power over peace and war? Who should hold the power to lead our Nation into the future? If you\'ve been listening to the Republican candidate in recent weeks, then you know he\'s trying to wrap himself in the mantle of great Democratic Presidents. It happens every election year. Let me read you what Franklin D. Roosevelt said back in 1944 about how Republicans changed their tune in the few weeks before an election. This is Roosevelt\'s words: ""The whole purpose of Republican oratory these days seems to be to switch labels. Now imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but I\'m afraid that in this case, it\'s the most obvious common or garden variety of fraud."" And now the Republicans have the nerve to come back and quote Franklin D. Roosevelt himself.', 'John Kennedy said in 1960 about the Republicans: ""They\'re even beginning to say a few kind words about Franklin Roosevelt. Twenty years from now, they might even speak a good word for Harry Truman. But Harry Truman will never say a good word about Republicans."" You can depend on that. And I make this prediction about the future myself. I predict that 20 years from now, Republican candidates for President will be saying nice things about Jimmy Carter\'s second term.', 'The Republican candidate, Governor Reagan, said this year, 1980, ""Fascism was really the basis of the New Deal."" Do you think that Franklin Roosevelt, the father of the New Deal, who brought us the minimum wage, who brought us social security, who brought us the REA, who brought us the first steps to a good medical care for our people would have wanted to be quoted by that candidate?', 'The Republican candidate, in 1980, this year, said, and I quote, ""I\'m opposed to national health insurance. There is no health crisis in America."" Do you think that Harry Truman, who first proposed national health insurance, would be rooting for that candidate today? The Republican candidate, this year, said that we could threaten a nuclear arms race. Do you imagine that John Fitzgerald Kennedy, who negotiated the nuclear test ban treaty, would have agreed with that? Of course not. Of course not. History doesn\'t change. There\'s a thrust of history that separates the Democratic Party and Democratic Presidents from those of the Republicans.', 'Many of you grew up like I did in the South. You saw your lives changed by Democratic administrations. They faced difficult issues. They made tough decisions. And almost always the Republicans were there in opposition to the Democrats giving the working people of this Nation, the elderly people of this Nation, a good life. Republicans were against the minimum wage when it was 25 cents an hour. Republicans were against social security. They called it socialism or even communism. Republicans were against the rural electrification program. They said that the power companies themselves ought not to have any competition from those TVA dams that gave our farmers a better life. The Republicans have always been against those programs that give people of this country a better life.', ""Let me say this too: Guess what Governor Reagan said about social security this week? For years he had a habit of suggesting that social security ought to be voluntary. But as the election time approached, he began to change his tune, but not very much. This week, in the debate, he said that social security is a bad investment. That is absolutely untrue. As a matter of fact, a typical married worker with dependents, starting out paying even the age of 22, will get back 3 1/2 times more than he's paid into social security. And all those years, when that young person is getting toward retirement age, he has the protection, if he becomes disabled—or if a husband dies, as you know the wife and the children until they're 18 years old are covered by social security. But Governor Reagan has a commitment to change that program established by Democrats which means so much to the people of this country."", 'For years, Governor Reagan opposed Medicare. He started in politics as a traveling salesman for the anti-Medicare lobby. All across this country he said that Medicare was socialism. That should not be too surprising. After all this is the same person who said the New Deal was based on fascism. It is the same person who said, just this year, that the minimum wage was the primary cause of unemployment. And this is also the same person who said that trees are the number-one came of pollution. [Laughter]', ""Let me say a few words about the Presidency. Last night I was in Missouri before I went to Columbia, South Carolina. We had a rally like this in St. Louis, and the memory of everyone in that audience was about Harry Truman. Harry Truman understood what the Presidency is. So did Franklin Roosevelt. So did Lyndon Johnson, and so did John Kennedy. There is a continuity in serving in the White House, almost always shared among Democrats, often by Republicans as well. We must have a strong nation, and as long as I'm President we will have a strong military force, because Democrats have known, and especially those of us from the South, that only through strength can we keep our Nation at peace."", ""In 7 of the last 8 years before I became President, when Republicans were in the White House, we had a decrease in real funds allotted in the Federal budget for our Nation's defense. Since I've been in office, we've had a steady, orderly, and effective increase above and beyond inflation every single year. When I came into office there was no long-range cruise missile program. Now we have one. There was no new battle tank or modern, armored personnel carrier. Now they're in production. There was no answer to the potential vulnerability of our ICBM's and silos to protect our Nation from strategic attack. Now there is an answer, the mobile MX missiles. Our purchases of Army equipment, jet fighters and aircraft, had dropped by two-thirds in the 8 years before I became President. Since then we've increased them by 50 percent."", ""I'm not trying to point out these changes since I've been in office in a deeper commitment for our national defense to frighten anyone. The point is that the only way to keep our Nation at peace is to keep our Nation militarily strong, to let the American people know it, to let our allies know it, and to let any potential adversary know that if they attack the United States of America, they will be committing national suicide."", ""I can stand here before you today, the first President in 50 years who can, and say that since I've been in the Oval Office, this Nation that we love has not been at war. We have been at peace. Every American wants peace. I'm sure my opponent wants peace. But you must carefully consider the consequences of his habit of calling for the use of armed forces. In 1975 he called for sending U.S. military forces to Ecuador and to Angola. In 1976 it was Rhodesia and Cyprus. This year, so far, Governor Reagan has advocated sending military forces of our country to Cuba, to Pakistan, and to the Middle East. It's important for you and me to make sure Tuesday that we don't have to find out in 1981 where he wants to send American military forces next year."", ""Another very important subject, more important than social security, more important than the minimum wage, more important than medicare, more important than any other issue that's before us this year, and that is how to limit atomic weapons, nuclear arms."", 'Every President since World War II, Democrats and Republicans, has sought agreements with the Soviet Union, balanced controls, confirmed agreement to limit nuclear weapons with a commitment to lower the level of nuclear arms in both countries in the future. The test ban treaty, under President Kennedy, the antiballistic missile or ABM treaty, under President Nixon, the Vladivostok agreement, under President Ford, the nuclear arms limitation agreement that I signed earlier in my administration, last year, negotiated 7 years by three Presidents, Governor Ronald Reagan has never supported a single one of these agreements to limit nuclear weapons. Instead, he proposes to tear up the existing agreement and threaten a massive, new nuclear arms race.', 'Also he says—and this is almost equally disturbing—that when other countries, like Iraq or Libya, try to develop and to build their own nuclear weapon, it\'s none of our business. During the debate this week, Governor Reagan flatly denied that he had ever said that, yet the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Washing Star, and other news media around this country quoted him when he said it-not once, but more than once. Here\'s what the New York Times said February 1st, 1980: ""Ronald Reagan indicated today that he believes the United States should not stand in the way of countries developing their own nuclear weapons."" Governor Reagan said, and I quote him,"" \'I just don\'t think it\'s any of our business?""', ""It'll be too late to ask Governor Reagan what he meant by that statement after he gets in the Oval Office, if he should be elected. Now is the time for every American to stop and think about the consequences of casting aside nuclear arms limitation agreements and opening up the way for terrorist countries to have atomic weapons. The spread of nuclear weapons to all nations, and especially to those who harbor terrorists or even engage in terrorism themselves, is our business. And with your help and support, we will keep the commitment of this Nation, which has been the commitment of all Presidents, Democratic and Republican, to control those nuclear weapons and to avoid the threat of nuclear destruction which might come if a deviation from that policy should occur."", ""And finally let me say this: The President of the United States is not just the servant of the present, but he's also in many ways the guardian of the future. His actions echo down through the years in the judges he appoints, in the regulatory board members he chooses, the agenda he sets for this Nation. When he sits as a head of state with other leaders from around the world, he must always be aware that his every word is weighed and measured because his voice is the voice of America. He must be sensitive to other nations' concerns, but he must be adamant in the protection of American interests."", ""As Commander in Chief the President has within his power the unleashing of the most awesome destructive military force the world has ever seen. If he's skillful and wise, if he's understanding and tolerant, if he's moderate in his actions and committed to carrying out the desires of the American people, he'll never have to order that unleashing of great destructive power."", ""I know that you believe that we have a major task before us, and I know that you believe that the President of this country has a major responsibility on his shoulders. I'd like to point out in closing that November the 4th you'll have to make a judgment about what this Nation will be. A President represents himself, yes. A President represents his party, the Democratic Party, the mainstream of it. A President has to make judgments, when times of trouble or crisis or armed conflict arise in the world, about the level of our Nation's interest and what our Nation's involvement ought to be. A President can have advisers to come into the Oval Office and to sit with him and to consider what ought to be done. But my experience with advisers is that when the issue is very close, when the decision is very great and profound, the President must make that judgment alone. He must share with the American people the commitment of his life, the experience that he has, his knowledge of our country."", ""You will make a decision on November the 4th in a similar way. You'll be alone, and you'll decide between now and then how deeply your feelings will persist as you cast your votes. I presume that you'll be here and will be helping me as you go to the polls and vote, but I want to ask you to do this: Think about the future during these next few days. Think about your family members. Think about the people that you love and those who love you. Think about the severity of the consequences of the election day: peace, war, employment, civil rights, minimum wage, social security, protection of consumers, an energy policy, the stature of our Nation, moderation, progress. These are the kinds of issues that are important to every person who listens to my voice. And I ask you to go to the polls on November the 4th and between now and then to make a sacrificial effort to get all those over whom you have influence or listen to you to join with us in a noble crusade to make the greatest nation on Earth even greater in the future."", 'Thank you very much. I love you. God bless you.']"
80,Jimmy Carter ,"October 31, 1980","['Governor Bill Winter, former Senator Jim Eastland, Mayor Dale Banks, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chairman, my friends from Mississippi:', ""Last night about this time I was in St. Louis, Missouri, talking to people who remembered the great Presidency of Harry Truman. Early this morning I was in Columbia, South Carolina. Later I was in the central part of the State of Florida. Then I went up to Memphis, Tennessee, and now I've come here to Jackson, Mississippi. And tonight I'll be in Houston, Texas. Tonight I want to talk to you for a few minutes about the Southland, about what it means to be a southerner and about what Mississippi has meant in my own campaign to become President of the United States, the first President from the Deep South since James Polk was elected in 1844."", ""I remember election night of 1976, when the issue was in doubt: the choice between a Republican President for 4 more years and a southern Democrat, who'd be in the White House for 8 years. Mississippi came through then. You've set a good tradition. I'm counting on you Tuesday night."", ""First I want to clear up a very important point. Last night in Missouri I was reminded of the fact that when Harry Truman ran in 1948 they said he ran a mean campaign. Some people say that I've run a mean campaign, but I have not. I want to tell the truth about the Republicans, and when I do, they always say it's mean."", ""I grew up on a farm in deep south Georgia, very similar to the lives of many of you or at least your mothers and fathers during the Depression years. I remember what it meant to live in a house that didn't have electricity or running water. We worked from early in the morning till late at night. To plow—a mule; we didn't have tractors. We didn't have electricity on our farm. And we had a lot of needs in our lives. And then Herbert Hoover, a typical Republican, was replaced by Franklin D. Roosevelt in the White House. Franklin Roosevelt proposed the TVA, the REA, to transform the lives of all southerners. The Republicans were against TVA. They were against REA. They said it was socialism or communism for the Government to bring electricity to rural farms in Mississippi and in Georgia."", ""My mother had to work for a living. She was a registered nurse. She worked 12 hours a day. She was paid $4. Sometimes she worked 20-hour-a-day duty. Then she was paid $6. The Democrats thought that men and women who were grown and who had to support a family were worth at least a minimum wage. They put forth 25-cent-an-hour minimum wage. It was quite a struggle, because the Republicans were against it. They didn't believe that an able-bodied man or woman was worth 25 cents an hour. Later, as I approached the age to finish high school, I got my first job measuring land for the Government, 10 hours a day, furnished my own car and paid all expenses; 40 cents an hour, which was the minimum wage then. The Democrats were for increasing the minimum wage to 40 cents. The Republicans, predictably, were against it."", ""Franklin Roosevelt felt that the senior citizens, the elderly in our country, ought to get out of po' folks homes, and they ought to have social security. So, Franklin Roosevelt put forward the idea of social security. The Democrats supported him. The Republicans said it was socialism, communism. They opposed it. But the Democrats prevailed, and now our senior citizens in this Nation, nationwide, have some respect in their old age, and they have a security that they didn't have before."", 'Later, in 1961, Democrats proposed Medicare to give senior citizens some chance for good medical attention. Obviously, the Republicans were against it. Democrats prevailed, and now we have a better life.

Twenty years from now,"" Kennedy said, ""they might even speak a good word for Harry Truman. But I guarantee you that Harry Truman will never say a good word about Republicans."" Now, you all know that that prediction of John Kennedy came true. And I want to make a prediction to you tonight. Twenty years from now, Republican candidates are going to be saying nice things about Jimmy Carter\'s second term.', ""Presidents have a lot of duties to perform, and I'm talking about the South tonight. I came from a family; my father didn't finish high school. Neither did his father.

We've always been in the forefront of volunteering to go to war, to give our lives, if necessary, to defend our Nation. The honor roll of those who lose their lives is always headed by southerners, who know what it means to defend basic rights. But we also know what it means to have a strong defense. When I got to the Oval Office as President, as an ex-submarine officer, for 8 years Republicans had let the Americans' defenses go down. Seven of those 8 years, we had had a decrease in the commitment of Federal budget dollars for defense. Since I've been in the Oval Office, with the help of John Stennis, who was speaking for me last night in Columbus, we know that we have had a steady increase in defense expenditures above and beyond the cost of inflation.

The Oval Office is sometimes a lonely place, but the judgment, the moderation, the careful, prayerful consideration of basic issues in a time of crisis is the important function of a President who serves you.', ""I said earlier I grew up on a farm. I want to say just a word about agriculture. I know something about farmers. I even know what parity means. [Laughter] When I was growing up, farmers had a difficult life. There was no price support for agricultural products, there was no stability in our lives. It was boom one year and bust the next—mostly bust because when the farmers made a good crop, they sold at harvest time, and the middlemen bought our products, and when the price went up later on, maybe because they held grain from the market or cotton from the market, the farmers didn't get the profit. Now that's been changed under a Democratic administration. And we've got a policy that's been in effect since I've been in office, with Bob Bergland, a farmer, as the Secretary of Agriculture, that has transformed the lives of many farmers in this Nation."", ""Since I've been in office, we've had the highest gross income in history, the biggest increase in net income in history, the biggest exports of American farm products in history. Now we've got the most onfarm storage in history—2.8 billion bushels of grain are now being stored by the farmers on their farms so that they can market their grain when the markets are good. This not only helps farm families it costs the middlemen, yes—but it helps consumers as well, because you don't have the wild fluctuations in wheat, corn, oats, milk, and other products that we had before under the Republicans, as you know."", ""We had Secretaries of Agriculture, not who were farmers, but we had Secretaries of Agriculture who were employees or executives of the very middlemen who had been responsible for keeping farmers impoverished for many years. It's better to have a Secretary of Agriculture who's a dirt farmer, and that's what we'll have as long as I'm in the White House."", ""I want to say a word to you about an issue that you may not ever have thought about much before and that's China—the People's Republic of China. One of the difficult decisions that I've had to make, as President, has been to normalize relationships with one-fourth of the total population of this Earth a billion people in China. You might say what has that got to do with someone who lives in Jackson, Mississippi, or who lives on a farm in southern Mississippi? I'll tell you what it's got to do with it. Right now, as Jim Eastland knows, the number—one customer in the world for American cotton is China, and we've only had normal relationships with them 2 years. We just signed an agreement where they will buy every year between 6 million and 9 million tons of American grain."", ""In Mexico—we have tripled trade with Mexico in just 4 years, and now we have a good contract and a good ability to sell American rice, Mississippi rice, to countries like Korea. They'll have their biggest orders with us this year ever. And recently when I met with the new, democratically elected President of Nigeria—the biggest, most powerful, and newest democracy in Africa—they agreed to open up their markets for American rice. These are the kinds of things that have helped us to make good progress."", ""I know what it means to be able to sell things we grow on the farm, not just to American consumers but to consumers around the world. In 1977 we set a world record for farm exports. In 1978 we broke the record. In 1979 we broke it again. And this year we'll have an $8 billion increase in American exports overseas, up to a total now of $40 billion, a new record again."", 'When Ronald Reagan was asked about subsidies, he said he wasn\'t familiar with the subject. [Laughter] And only recently he\'s heard about the Tennessee-Tombigbee, which is going to take those farm products to market. Recently he said, and I quote him, which may be mean [laughter] —here\'s what he said about price supports: ""You subsidize the inefficient,"" he said, ""when you put a floor under the price for farmers."" And again he said at a later time, he said, farmers should start planning for an end to Government assistance in production and in the marketplace.', ""Well, people of Mississippi, I know what it means to have a stabilized price for farmers, because you can have a devastating drought that wipes you out one year. You can have the highest production in the world the next year. Farmers don't want a handout. Farmers want to stand on their own feet, but they want to have markets that are stable and predictable, because they can't control the weather. And almost all of our programs that we have don't cost America anything. They help the farmer, yes, but they help our consumers as well. It's the best investment I know in the economy of this country."", 'Just a word about energy, because, as you know, most of American energy comes here from the South in oil and gas. I believe, like you southerners, that we ought to have a minimum of interference by the Federal Government in the private affairs of American citizens and in the free enterprise system of our country. Republican Presidents have been promising for a decade to deregulate the price of oil and natural gas. The Democratic Congress, working with me, has done that, careful and projected to the future so everyone can understand the benefits of it.', ""This year we will have more oil and gas wells drilled in the United States than any year in history. Right now we've got over 3,100 drillrigs running in the United States, never before that many in history. And this year, ladies and gentlemen—this may be a surprise to you—we'll produce more coal in the United States than any year in history. We are exporting more coal than any year in our history, and in the next 15 years, keeping our same, rigid standards, on air pollution and water pollution, we will triple the production of American coal. What I want to see on the international markets is to replace OPEC oil with American coal and American energy, and we're going to do it."", ""And finally let me say, looking to the future, I've talked to you about this election not just as a contest between two men who disagree on every major issue that I've described to you, but it's a campaign to decide the future of this Nation, the rest of this century and perhaps beyond."", 'Think on things that are important to you—agriculture, trade, stability. Think about the minimum wage, which Ronald Reagan wants to repeal. Think about peace. Think about a strong defense. Think about social security. Think about Medicare. Think about the things that are important in your life now and in the future. I see a nation in the future strong. I see a nation at peace. I see a nation secure. I see a nation in the pursuit of progress for all its people. I see a nation where everyone can have the dignity of a decent job, where new industries create a new generation of American buildings and vehicles that will house us and move us in comfort on a lot less energy, and what energy we use coming from America, not overseas.', ""I see a nation where our children are better educated to their maximum potential that God's given them, where the elderly are treated with the respect, which they have earned with their life's work, where families are secure and intact and respect one another. I have a vision of a nation free enough to attract the deprived from other parts of the world, a nation of liberty and justice and love."", ""I need your help this next few days, because, as you know, the election is not very far off. I've been President now for almost 4 years. I've made thousands of decisions. In each one of those decisions in the Oval Office, I have been learning about this country. Every decision I make leaves me better qualified to make the next decision. What I've learned has made me a better President over a 4-year period, and it'll make me a better President in my second term."", ""I consider myself to be in the mainstream of the Democratic Party. I consider myself to be a true southerner, representing the ideals and commitments that have made us proud of our own region of this land. I also consider myself in the mainstream of bipartisan Presidents, Democrats and Republicans, who've had tremendous responsibilities on our shoulders and who've tried to represent our Nation well. Like them, I believe that our Nation must be strong, yes. The Nation must be secure. We must have a society that's just and fair. We must dare to struggle for a peaceful world."", ""There have been times of crisis and conflict during these years. In each case I alone have had to determine what are the interests of my Nation, what degree of involvement should we put forward? Should we try to resolve problems diplomatically or politically, or should we send American soldiers to die overseas? I've learned that the more difficult the decision is, the more likely it is that my advisers and experts will be divided almost equally. The final judgment has to be made by the man in the Oval Office."", ""Sometimes it is a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people like you and the heritage that I've gotten from you it's a gratifying job. Now each one of you faces a similar lonely decision next Tuesday in the voting booth. Your decision will make a difference. It's made a difference in the past. Think how few votes would have changed in 1948 and Harry Truman would never have been President. Think how few votes would have been changed in 1960 and John Kennedy would never have served this Nation, and think how few votes would have been changed in 1968 to put another Democrat in the White House and Richard Nixon would never have served and embarrassed our Nation."", ""So, my final word is I need you to go on with me to build a partnership, to stay strong, to stay secure, to raise high the banner of human rights, and to keep our Nation at peace. For the sake of all we've done in the past, the things that have made us proud of Mississippi, proud of Georgia, proud of this Nation, for the sake of all we can do in the future together to make us even prouder of a life that we can have, let's win a victory next Tuesday, not just for me and Fritz Mondale, not just for the Democratic Party, but let's win a victory for the South, for the ideals and beliefs that we have, the vision that we share for a greater nation even than we've had before."", ""You join me. We'll have a partnership. We'll whip the Republicans and have a great nation.Thank you very much. God bless you.""]"

I'll take it."", ""First of all, let me say that it's really great to be in your wonderful State of Texas. At least you have got a real southern gentleman for your Lieutenant Governor. [Laughter] To Congressman Mickey Leland, Congressman Bob Eckhardt, one of the great leaders, not only of Texas but of the entire Nation and who needs to stay in the Congress and who needs your help, all of you help him. Jack Brooks already won his election overwhelmingly, as you know. Mike Andrews is going to be your next Congressman from the 22nd District, Bob Hutchins, next Congressman from the District 7. And I want to say that it's good to be in a city that can produce a baseball team like the Astros. You can really be proud of them. The whole Nation was, and I'm very glad that Joe Sambito and Joe Niekro are here tonight. And I noticed the Houston Oilers are right up there at the top, right? [Applause]"", ""It's always good to come back to Houston, because you run out of great things to say about it—the biggest city in the biggest county in the biggest continental State—a city, by the way, that since the day I was sworn in as President, has added 240,000 new jobs for Houston citizens. That's great."", 'Last night about this time I was in St. Louis, Missouri, and I was speaking to an audience that remembered very clearly the time of Harry Truman, a great President who understood what our Nation was all about, a man who made some difficult decisions, a man who was castigated by the Republicans because they said he was too mean when he ran his campaign. [Laughter] Sometimes they say the same thing about me. All I do is tell the truth about Ronald Reagan, and the truth sounds mean.', ""If you've been listening to the campaign lately you've probably noticed that the Republican candidate, everywhere he goes, quotes Democratic Presidents. Have you ever heard a Republican candidate for President quoting a Republican President?"", 'AUDIENCE. No!', 'THE PRESIDENT. No. And there\'s a good reason for it, because every time an election approaches they like to forget about their record. It happens every election year. As a matter of fact, Franklin Roosevelt said in 1944—and I\'d like to quote that great President about how the Republicans change their tune when election day approaches—he said, (\'The whole purpose of Republican oratory these days seems to be to switch labels. Now, imitation,"" he said, ""may be the sincerest form of flattery, but I\'m afraid that in this case it\'s the most obvious garden or common variety of fraud.""', 'Now, that didn\'t stop with Franklin Roosevelt. It happened, the same thing, when John Kennedy ran for President in 1960. He said about the Republicans, ""They\'re even beginning to say a few kind words about Franklin Roosevelt. Twenty years from now,"" Kennedy said, ""they might even say a good word about Harry Truman. But,"" he said, ""I guarantee you ,that Harry Truman will never say a good word about a Republican."" [Laughter] And I want to make a prediction to you tonight. Twenty years from now I predict that Republican candidates are even going to be saying good things about Jimmy Carter\'s second term.', ""You're the State that has provided great leaders in Washington for the Democratic Party and for our Nation. Sam Rayburn was a man who led the Congress of the United States, who knew what it meant to be a Democrat, to be proud to be part of the South, to take the heritage that is part of our own consciousness and let it be beneficial for the rest of the country. And when the New Deal came along there were people like you and me who were waiting for a change in life. And I think it's time, with just 3 or 4 days to go before you make a great decision, to think back on those days. Some of you are quite young, Larry Gatlin's age, who's a great friend of mine. Some of you, old as I am. I was born in 1924, but I remember how things have changed, in my life, because of the Democrats."", ""I grew up on a farm in south Georgia, where everybody worked from before daybreak until after sundown and then had to plow, put the plow in the barn, pump water for the mules, and then go to bed after dark. My mother was a registered nurse. She worked 12 hours a day for $4 or either she worked 20 hours a day for $6. We didn't have electricity on our farm. And old people when they got past retirement age, if they didn't have a family that was rich, had to go to what we called the po' folks farm. Maybe some of you remember those days."", 'Roosevelt came along, and as a young man Lyndon Johnson helped Franklin D. Roosevelt. As is the case with Democrats, they cared about working people. And they looked upon old people and said, ""We need to make sure that when they reach retirement age, they have some self respect."" So, Roosevelt proposed, along with Democrats, that we have social security. The Republicans opposed it. They called it socialism, even called it communism. Franklin Roosevelt thought that the American farmers ought to have electricity, proposed TVA, REA. The Republicans opposed it, called it socialism, even communism.', 'Roosevelt even was radical enough to believe that a grown man or a grown woman ought to be paid living wages; 25 cents an hour was the first proposed minimum wage. Republicans were against it. They called it socialism, communism, the interference of government in the private affairs of big business. I got my first job when I finished high school in 1941. I worked 10 hours a day for the minimum wage, which at that time was 40 cents. I had to furnish my own car and pay all the expenses to measure land for the government. Republicans opposed that radical increase from 25 cents to 40 cents an hour. This has been the typical continuing struggle between the party you and I represent and the Republicans who always imitate Democrats just before elections to get in office.', 'Later in 1961, Medicare was proposed to give our senior citizens a chance for some medical care when they reached the retirement age if they didn\'t have much money. My Republican opponent, Ronald Reagan, an employee of the anti-Medicare lobby, went around this Nation making speeches, and he referred to Medicare as socialism—""socialized medicine,"" he said. Now he\'s against national health insurance.', ""He's proposed several times lately that social security be voluntary. This year he proposed that the minimum wage be abolished. He said that the thing that's caused more misery and more unemployment in this country than anything since the Great Depression was the minimum wage. And he said the other night in the debate-you probably heard it—that social security was a bad investment for a young person. The fact is that a young man, a husband, or a young mother with children, if they start at the age of 22 and put their money into social security, they'll get back 3 1/2 times more than they put in. And all that time they're working they have the protection of disability, or if one of them dies, survivor's benefits for the other spouse and all the children until they're 18. That's the kind of program that Ronald Reagan is still against. He can't change his spots just before election, although he's trying very desperately to do so. And it's important for us to remember these basic truths as we approach the time for a decision."", ""My people have lived in this country for a long time, since the 1600's. They've all been farmers, every one of them. My father never had a chance to finish high school; neither did his father. Nobody in my family ever finished high school until me. And I had an ambition when I was a child to go to the Naval Academy, to get a college education. It was a wild dream. Nobody ever thought I could ever do it. But I was lucky enough to go. I served in the Navy for 11 years and when I got out of the submarine force, I went back home and saw the changes take place in the Southland, when black people and those who speak Spanish were finally given equal rights, a right to vote, a right to be holding a job, a right to have a chance in life."", 'And let me ask you a question. Let me ask you a question, those of you who might speak Spanish, those of you who might be black, those of you who might be women. Which party has always been in favor of helping those who felt the scourge of discrimination? The Democrats. The Democrats. And it has not changed. It has not changed. We would never have had the civil rights bill, the voting rights bill, had Roosevelt, Johnson, Kennedy not been elected. Never would have happened.', 'Another thing—let me say this— [applause] —I agree with you. And let me say this, when the civil rights act and the voting rights act was passed—', '[Interruption from the audience.]', ""You're for me. Be quiet, man."", 'AUDIENCE [chanting]. Four more years!', ""THE PRESIDENT. He's for me. Let me finish. That's good. Okay, let me talk. And when the voting rights act and the civil rights act passed, Ronald Reagan said that's bad legislation. So, what we need to do is to remember as election day approaches, which party is best for our country."", ""I went in the Oval Office as a young President, remembering that our Nation had to be strong. I went into the Oval Office, after I was elected, as a young military officer concerned about what had happened to our Nation's defense the last 8 years before I became President. In those 8 years, 7 of them under Republicans-the Republicans"", '[Interruption from the audience.]', 'AUDIENCE [chanting]. Four more years!', 'THE PRESIDENT. Okay, you got me. Thank you.', 'The Republicans have a lot of money. They have enough money to back—to pay a few people to work for them.', ""I want to cover three more points to you, because these are important because they affect your lives. One is concerning defense. When I was elected President the Republican administration 8 years before I was elected cut spending for defense every year except one. We had a reduction of 37 percent below what it was a year before when Nixon became President, in 8 years—37-percent reduction. Every year since I've been in office, as a Democratic President, we have added to our defense spending to give our country strength in our military forces. This will continue for the next 5 years, because I know, like other people know, that we can only have peace in our Nation if our Nation is strong. And I can make another statement that no other President can make in the last 50 years. Since I have been in the Oval Office, our Nation has not known war; we have been at peace. And I'm going to keep this Nation at peace."", ""I know I'm in the State of Texas, and I want to say something about land and I want to say something about oil. First of all, all the Republican Presidents have always promised that when they got in the Oval Office that they were going to decontrol the price of oil and gas to let our Nation produce more energy. Who has been able to do it? A Democratic President, working with a Democratic Congress, and we've already seen rich results for our Nation. This year we will have more new oil wells and gas wells producing in this country than any year in history. We've got more oil drillrigs running right now than the Nation has ever had in history. We're producing more American coal than we've ever produced in history, and we're cutting every day the amount of oil we buy from overseas."", 'In economics Democrats have always been those in favor of the investment in new jobs, new plants, new opportunities for our people. Ronald Reagan has a basic approach to taxation and economics called the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal.', ""[Boo' s from the audience.]"", 'You understand it very well.', 'You all know that Business Week is a magazine that\'s not particularly a Democratic publication. But Business Week said that Ronald Reagan\'s tax proposal was completely irresponsible, that it would cause an inflationary explosion that would destroy this Nation\'s economy, and it would impoverish every person in this country living on a fixed income. That\'s what Business Week thinks about Ronald Reagan\'s tax proposal. And George Bush, who was a temporary Texan, said that Ronald Reagan\'s proposal was ""voodoo economics"" and would cause 30-percent inflation. At least one time George Bush was right.', ""And the final point I want to make is this, about land, about agriculture. As I said earlier, I grew up on a farm, and I was very interested when I got to be President to have a Secretary Of Agriculture who was a dirt farmer. In the past, as you know, the Republicans have chosen for Secretary of Agriculture a lobbyist or an executive in the major food-processing companies or the middlemen who handle large quantities of grain after the farmers sell it cheap at harvest time. I wanted to be sure I had somebody in there like Bob Bergland who understood the life of an American farm family. We've changed."", ""We've had a lot of progress made already. Look back on what happened to the farmers in 1977 before we passed our new farm bill. Corn prices have doubled. Wheat prices have doubled. Beef prices have doubled. In the last 3¼ years gross income of farmers in this Nation have grown faster than ever before in history. Net farm income has gone up more than ever before in history. On exports—Texas is a very important State—we've had more exports and set a new record in 1977, a higher record in '78, an even higher record in '79. And this year we had the biggest increase in exports in the history of our Nation, $8 billion. We'll export $40 billion overseas this year."", ""And I want to mention a word to you that you might not think about concerning farm families, and that's China. There are 4 billion people who live on this Earth. A billion of them live in China. We've normalized relationships now with that country about 2 years ago. This year we just signed an agreement—as a matter of fact last week—to sell China between 6 million tons and 9 million tons of American grain every year. The number one customer for American cotton right now is the People's Republic of China. We've tripled trade with Mexico in the last 4 years. We've opened up the sale of our products to Korea, to Nigeria, to other countries. The American farmers have never been better off. That's a very important commitment, an historic commitment of the Democratic Party."", ""And finally let me say this: I may not have mentioned it earlier, but I need your help this next few days. November the 4th is the day. A President has sometimes a difficult job, but he has to face problems that affect your life. I've made thousands of decisions since I've been in the Oval Office, and every time I've made a decision I've learned in the process. I became a better President with every decision, and I'll be a better President than I have already in the second term."", ""I've never served one day as President that there wasn't a crisis or a troublespot somewhere in the world. There have been six or eight armed conflicts that broke out in the world since I've been President. I've had to make a judgment about our Nation's interests and about the depth of our Nation's involvement, whether to handle that problem through politics or diplomacy, or through the injection of American military forces into those troubled areas. A President has good advice, but I know from experience that when the difficult times come and the issue is sharply divided and the decision is very important, that advisers tend to split about 50-50. A President has to make a decision based on sound judgment, based on prayer, based on the understanding of the conscience of this country, about peace, or war. And I believe in peace."", ""I have to make some difficult and some lonely decisions. In the next few days, 100 million Americans have to make a difficult and a lonely decision. That decision will affect your life, the life of your family, the life of people that you love, the ones that look to you for leadership. You would not have come here tonight if you weren't interested in politics and government, but you have a responsibility like I do, the next few days, to make those judgments about the future of our Nation. You might say, well, one person can't make much difference, but think back on 1948. If just a few people had voted differently, Harry Truman would never have been President. In 1960, if 28,000 people had changed their vote in Texas and a few thousand in Illinois, then John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson would never have served this Nation as President. If just a few people had gone out and worked a little harder in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President and Richard Nixon would never had embarrassed this Nation in the White House."", ""So, you've got a choice to make, between the Herbert Hoover to Richard Nixon Republican Party, or the Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, Harry Truman, John Kennedy, and Jimmy Carter Democratic Party. I need your help. Will you help me? We'll win together. We'll win together. Four more years, right. [Applause and cheers]""]"
82,Jimmy Carter ,"November 01, 1980","['THE PRESIDENT. Mayor Hernandez, Congressman Kika de la Garza, Lieutenant Governor Bill Hobby, my many friends here in Brownsville:', ""It's a great honor to be with you.

Thank you for your great welcome."", ""As you know, Zachary Taylor was here before, but that doesn't count because he came as a general. [Laughter] And I understand he built these buildings, some of them, these historic buildings, as an army post. But we've come a long way since then, and now this is a center of great education for some of the finest people in the United States. This is a college where a great man, the late Dr. Arnulfo Oliveria was president. Dr. Oliveria will be sorely missed. And I'm very grateful to know that his wife Eloisa is here with us this morning. We're glad to have you here."", ""As you know, this great man's life was dedicated to better education for the people that he loved. For decades he worked for progress and for enlightenment. He inspired a generation of students with his fine example. And he also did much to improve the quality of education throughout the State of Texas, in part by helping to ensure equal access to educational opportunity for children and for young people from Spanish-speaking homes."", ""As you know, one of the issues at stake in this election is equality of education. The Democratic Party has always been the party of better education for those who were poor and whose families didn't have a good chance, but we believe that the children, with the gift of God of intelligence and ability, ought to have a chance in an educational system to expand that intelligence and to use that ability for their own selves and for this country. The Republican record has always been just exactly the opposite."", ""Governor Reagan, who's running against me, does not share Dr. Oliveria's commitment and my own to better education. We have doubled, since I've been in the White House, funds for student aid programs. And now there should be no child in the United States who finishes high school, no matter how poor their family might be, who cannot, through loans or grants, through scholarships or work-study programs, get a college education. And you can depend that we will continue that policy as long as the Democrats are in the White House."", ""We've expanded greatly the program called Head Start, and we've expanded it to include migrant children. We're working hard right now with Senator Bentsen and with Kika de la Garza to make as much as $45 million available in Federal money in the border districts to help with the increase in school construction for the number of Mexican school children who reside here legally, because decent education is not just a border issue, it is a national issue. And I won't forget it."", 'Governor Reagan\'s only commitment on education is this. He says, ""If I am elected President, I will abolish the Department of Education.""', 'There are other areas, too, where the sharp issues are drawn that will affect your lives. We could not have more different views, Governor Reagan and I, than we have in health. Governor Reagan says, and I quote him: ""Virtually all Americans have access to medical care today."" Yet in south Texas I know that 13 counties with 22 percent of the population of this great State have only 3 percent of the physicians.', ""That's why, in the tradition of great Presidents like Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, and Lyndon Johnson and also Vice President Humphrey and Senator Ted Kennedy, I am committed to national health insurance, which will provide a cost-saving emphasis on the prevention of disease, on catastrophic health insurance if a family's wiped out economically with high medical costs, on the control of hospital costs so they can't go too high on you, on outpatient treatment instead of inpatient treatment, and also to include, as you know, an additional three-quarters of a million people in south Texas who presently do not qualify for that kind of health care. That's why we've funded seven new consumer-run primary care centers in south Texas."", ""There's something else I'm committed to, and it's expressed by the Spanish saying: Dime con quien andas y te dire quien eres. [Tell me who you walk with, and I'll tell you who you are.] And you know who I walk with, right? [Cheers]"", ""I am proud that I've been able in just 3 1/2 )'ears to appoint more than 200 Hispanic Americans to senior Government positions, more than any other previous administration in history. And I know the concern of all Americans with equal justice. I'm very proud to have appointed three times as many Hispanic judges as all the Presidents combined in 200 years, since this Nation was formed, and they have been the highest possible quality."", ""I'll only mention one of them, because there's something special about him that perhaps you didn't know. One of them is Reynaldo Garza. He now sits as a judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. But many of you may not know about the first job I offered to Judge Garza in January of 1977, shortly before I was inaugurated President. I called Judge Garza, and I offered him the position as Attorney General of the United States."", ""I regret very much that because of personal considerations in his own family, that the United States did not have the benefit of his service in that Cabinet post as Attorney General. He would have been the first Hispanic Attorney General in the history of our country. But I am proud of the job that he's now doing on the Federal bench."", ""We flew in this morning from Houston, maintained a low altitude, and we had a chance to look at the absolutely beautiful farming country that you have here. And I wanted to say a word about agriculture, because it's important to me as a farmer, I know it's important to this district. You've been blessed by God with productive land, and you've utilized it to the highest as good stewards of what God has given you. I even know what parity means. [Laughter]"", ""When I was growing up, like many of you, I worked in the times before Franklin Roosevelt was able to change the attitude of this Nation's Government toward agriculture and toward farm families. We worked from dark in the morning till dark at night, getting ready to produce crops that quite often were stolen from us at the time of harvest. We didn't have electricity on our farms. And we didn't have any security for the aged who slaved all their lives away on the farm and wound up with nothing to show for it when they reached retirement age."", ""The Democrats changed all that. I remember when we put electricity on the farm, and I remember when we tried to stabilize the market so farmers could have a better life. That's why I'm very glad to come here to the State that produced a great President like Lyndon Baines Johnson, because he understood also the plight of American farmers and also the great contribution that agriculture makes to the economic life's blood of our Nation."", ""I began by appointing the Secretary of Agriculture, a dirt farmer, one who understands the special needs of farm families, Bob Bergland. He's been an outstanding man. And in the past, as you know, when Republican Presidents have chosen a Secretary of Agriculture, they've always chosen a bigshot executive in some company that buys products from farmers at a cheap price and sells those same products to consumers at a high price. We don't want another Earl Butz back in the Secretary's office. We want Bob Bergland."", ""Bob Bergland and I knew from experience that most often farmers, when they produce their grain, other products, had to put those products to market in the rush of the harvest season when prices were low. So, we figured it would be good to provide storage on farmers' farms. We've created 2.8 billion bushels of storage and now farmers can store their own crops. They can decide for themselves when to take those crops to market."", ""And that policy has paid rich dividends in two or three ways. One, we've increased prices a great deal that the farmers receive. Since 1977 the price of corn has almost doubled; the price of wheat has almost doubled; the price of beef has also doubled. And the consumers have benefited from it. The consumers have now stable policies in agriculture, and as you well know, we have a steady supply of good grain."", ""We've had in this last 3 years the biggest increase in gross income for America's farmers in history, the biggest increase in net income for American farm families in history. And on exports we have used great ports like Brownsville and great production areas like your own to increase the sale of products overseas. In 1977 we set a world's record on American farm exports; '78, broke that record; '79, broke it again. And this year we'll increase exports $8 billion to a new record of $40 billion worth of American farm products being sold overseas. That's the kind of program we've had for American farmers."", ""You might be interested in knowing that since 1977 we have tripled trade with Mexico, and this year we'll sell to Mexico 10 million tons of American grain."", ""We've opened up vast new opportunities for sales in the future with the People's Republic of China, where one-fourth of the people on Earth live. China has already become the number one customer for American cotton, and we've just recently signed an agreement with China where they will buy between 6 and 10 million tons of grain every year for the next 5 years. These opportunities have helped our country. They've also helped people like you.

It's an average of 15 loaves of bread per year per person in China, coming from American farms."", ""As you may know, the State of Georgia has a wonderful fishing industry, shrimp boats. And I don't want to pass without pointing out to you that Kika de la Garza and I have a great interest in those who own shrimp boats and the crews that work on them, and we're going to make sure that your opportunities to serve this Nation are honored in the years ahead as well."", ""In closing my remarks, I want to point out to you some considerations that must be important to you in the next few days.

You haven't heard Governor Reagan talking about Herbert Hoover, have you?AUDIENCE. No!"", 'THE PRESIDENT. Have you heard Governor Reagan quoting Richard Nixon?AUDIENCE. No!', 'THE PRESIDENT.

But then he turns around and says that the foundation for the New Deal is fascism; it's fascism."", 'And now the Republicans continue to quote Franklin D. Roosevelt. John Kennedy predicted back in 1960—let me quote him. This is what John Kennedy said about the Republicans: ""They\'re even beginning to say a few kind words about Franklin Roosevelt. Twenty years from now,"" Kennedy said, ""the Republicans might even speak a good word about Harry Truman. But I guarantee you that Harry Truman will never say a good word about Republicans.""', ""As you know, that prediction came true.

Thank you."", ""Let me say that I believe in the Democratic Party, and I hope that you'll think back in history, recent history and even as far back as I remember, about what the Democratic Party has meant to you. I believe in the mission of the Democratic Party. Every great advance that's been made in the lives of working people for the last 50 years has come under the Democratic administrations. Collective bargaining for workers, to the minimum wage, social security, Medicaid, Medicare-every single one of these has been made possible by Democrats, always over the opposition of Republicans."", ""I'm proud to be a Democrat, because our party stands for progress and it also stands for justice.

I see a nation at peace; a nation strong enough to be secure in its pursuit of progress for all our people; a nation where everyone has the dignity of a decent job, where new industries create a new generation of American buildings and American vehicles that will provide us with houses and will move us using less energy, that energy that we do use coming from our own Nation; a nation where children are educated to their maximum potential, where the elderly are treated with the respect that they've earned, where families are close and intact and secure. I have a vision of a nation free enough to attract and strong enough to welcome the deprived from other parts of the world; a nation of liberty, of justice, and of love. I need your help to make this vision a reality."", ""I've been President now for almost 4 years. I've made thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process for me. Every decision I make leaves me better prepared to make the next one.

I believe that the United States must be a nation strong. I believe the Nation must be secure. We must have a society that's just and fair. We must dare to struggle for a peaceful world."", ""There have been many times of crisis and conflict during these last few years. In each case, I alone have had to make a judgment about the interest of my Nation and about the involvement of my Nation. In each case, I've had to decide what to do to keep our Nation, its interests protected and to keep our boys from having to give their lives on the field of battle. And I'm proud that I can make a statement that no President in the last 50 years has been able to make: Since I have been in the Oval Office, our Nation has been at peace; we have not been at war."", ""I've learned one other thing, and that is that the more difficult the decisions are, the more important the issue is, the more likely that the advisers will be split roughly 50-50, and the President has to make the final judgment in the loneliness of the Oval Office. Sometimes it has been a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people, it's also a gratifying job."", ""Now each one of you, in the next few days, faces the same kind of decision, a lonely decision, because you'll go in the voting booth alone.

Are the issues important enough to you, to your family, to the people that you love, to work the next few days in a sacrificial way? There's no one here, no matter how poor or how lacking in influence, that can't reach several hundred people between now and election day. Some of you have enough influence to reach a thousand or 10,000."", ""And I hope you'll consider very carefully what will be the circumstances in your life Wednesday morning if you wake up to find that a Republican will be in the White House the next 4 years.AUDIENCE.

And I thank him on behalf of the people of this Nation. And I also want to express my thanks to Congressman Kazen, who comes from a Lebanese-American family, who spoke Spanish before he did English, because he represents the fact that this area is rich in its diversity, it's rich in its patriotism, it's rich in its commitment to a better life for all Americans, and I thank him too."", ""It's always good to be introduced by Lloyd Bentsen, a great Texan and a great American, a man who understands the past, present, and future of our Democratic Party and of our country, but it's particularly pleasing to me to be introduced in this historic site, a site which exemplifies not only the history of our Nation and its development but also epitomizes basic human courage. As a matter of fact, this historic site is a tourist attraction that helps to keep San Antonio prosperous and gives the world a chance to see what you have to offer here. But the Alamo will soon be seeing new action, redevelopment. It'll be linked to another historic site, the San Antonio River."", ""As you know, with a grant of $6 million from my Urban Development Action Grant program, we have been able to bring $48 million in private money to San Antonio. More than 800 permanent jobs will be created here in addition to many small businesses. And I'm very glad to say that there have been tens of thousands of new jobs created in San Antonio, almost a million new jobs created in the State of Texas since I was inaugurated President, and we're going to keep that progress going."", ""Lloyd Bentsen mentioned Republicans who try to masquerade as Democrats just before election day.

No. And there's a good reason for it, because their past record which will be the same as their future record if they get in the Oval Office, is not something to brag about."", 'Can you imagine Ronald Reagan, making a speech at the Republican Convention, when he quoted Franklin D. Roosevelt, quoting Herbert Hoover and Richard Nixon?AUDIENCE. No!', 'THE PRESIDENT. It always happens. Here\'s what Franklin D. Roosevelt said about that back in 1944.

I went to the Naval Academy, and I served 11 years in the Navy. I was an officer in the submarine force. I want to point out to you what has happened about defense in recent years.

In the last 50 years, no President has been able to make the statement that I'm going to make now. In my term of office, we have not had war. We have stayed at peace.AUDIENCE. Four more years!"", 'THE PRESIDENT. Thank you. Okay. I accept. [Laughter]', ""And the reason that we're going to have 4 more years and also 4 more years at peace, is that we have corrected the neglect of our Nation's defense establishment that I inherited after 13 years of Republican misrule. In 7 of those 8 years, under Nixon and Ford, when Republicans were in the White House, we had a decrease in real terms for our Nation's defense. Since I've been in office, though, with the help of Lloyd Bentsen and the Members of the Congress, we've had a steady, orderly, and effective increase above and beyond inflation every single year for a strong defense for the strongest nation on Earth, and we're going to keep that up."", ""When I came into office, there was no long-range cruise missile program. Now we have one. We'll be producing 40 highly accurate, advanced cruise missiles per month. When I came into office, there was no new battle tank. Now we have one. There was no modern armored fighting vehicle to carry personnel; now they're in production. There was no answer to the potential vulnerability of our ICBM's, our missiles located in silos. Now we have an answer, the mobile MX missile. And listen to this: Under those Republican Presidents, our purchases of Army equipment, jet fighters, and attack aircraft had dropped by two-thirds in the 13 years before I became President. Since then, we have increased those purchases by 50 percent."", ""We know that the purpose of a strong defense is to keep our Nation at peace and to protect American interests and the interests of our allies around the world. Every day that I've been in office, we've had trouble places somewhere in the world. Armed conflict has broken out in different locations between nations six or eight times since I've been President. The judgment that has to be made is what are America's interests? What degree of involvement should we exercise? How should we use our tremendous strength?"", ""We'll keep the most modern weapons. We'll keep the highest trained military men and women to serve our Nation.

He has called for the sending of American military forces to fight in many areas around the world in recent years, not just since I've been President, when this year he called for the sending of American troops to Cuba and to Angola and to other countries, Pakistan, but in the past to North Korea, to settle a fishing dispute in Ecuador. This year he wanted to send American military forces to establish a blockade around the island of Cuba. He wanted also to send American military forces to Cyprus, to Rhodesia, and to the Middle East."", ""Presidents have to make a judgment when troubled times arise, when crises come to the Oval Office.

Just since I've been old enough to remember-I grew up on a farm—we got REA, the TVA program, electricity on the farms, by Democrats, over Republican opposition. We got the minimum wage, which at first was only 25 cents an hour. The Republicans opposed it, because they didn't think that an able-bodied man or an able-bodied woman was worth 25 cents an hour. I got my first job as a high school graduate working 10 hours a day at the new minimum wage of 40 cents. I had to furnish a car and pay all the expenses in the process. But that 40-cent wage, guaranteed by the Democrats, was opposed by the Republicans."", 'Social security—the Democrats put it forward; the Republicans called it socialism, communism. Medicare, a Democratic program—my opponent got his start in politics campaigning all around the country speaking against Medicare, calling it socialized medicine.', 'The Republicans and the Democrats historically have had a different attitude toward progress or lack of progress. One of the key issues in this election is concerning social justice. At stake is whether we continue to build a society committed to equality of opportunity and social justice.

When Lyndon Johnson and the Democratic Congress were passing the Civil Rights Act, Ronald Reagan said, ""That\'s bad legislation.""', ""I'm for the open housing amendment now before Congress, and I'm for the equal rights amendment to give women equal treatment in this country. And I might add that for 40 years, for 40 years, the Republican Party platform always supported equal rights for women until Ronald Reagan came along. Six Presidents before me in the White House supported equal rights for women. My mother was a working woman. She was a registered nurse. She worked 12 hours a day when I was a child for $4, and sometimes she nursed 20 hours a day in order to earn $6. Nowadays when a man and woman do the same work a man gets paid a dollar; a woman only gets paid 59 cents."", 'What the equal rights amendment says is this: that equality of rights—this is the whole thing—equality of rights shall not be abridged or taken away by the Federal Government nor any other State government because a person is a woman.

I'm for the youth bill now before the Congress, already passed the House, that will provide 600,000 jobs for our young people. I'm for tough safeguards to protect our environment. I'm for protecting consumers so you won't be cheated.

That's a pretty good record."", 'A lot of good Texans have come out to welcome me. I notice that your illustrious Governor was not here to see me.

Many of you also share with me a common religious faith. I'm sure that some of you have seen campaign advertisements and mailings that attack my religious faith and also my character in a very ugly way. You may see even more in the next few days. I'm not going to dignify these attacks by counterbalancing each one and denying what they've alleged, which are all false. I don't intend to debate the sincerity of my own religious convictions in a political campaign. I have to depend on you who know me, know what I stand for, to speak up for me.

Somebody told me it's the largest one they've ever seen in west Texas. And I'm deeply grateful also for a chance now for the next 7 or 8 minutes—and I'll be relatively briefs-to give you a special political speech that I've never made before. In this long election campaign the past records and statements of the candidates have been thoroughly debated, thoroughly scrutinized, but more important than what has been said or done in the past is what will be done in the future, what must be done to build the kind of future that you would like to have for yourselves, your family and for those you love. So, I want to talk to you about my hopes and plans for the next 4 years, building on what we've already accomplished together since I've been in office, about a common agenda for the second term of office which I hope to serve as your President."", ""First, I want to say that I'm confident about the future of our Nation. The next 4 years can be very good years. The major reason for confidence is that we have learned. We've learned so much about the challenges that have confronted us the last few months, and we've laid the foundation now to meet those challenges in the future. We know we face dangers in the world, but we've learned to use our strength wisely, in the service of our real interests, and our real values."", ""We know we face problems at home. We've learned a great deal also about the causes and the nature of some of those problems and about the courage and determination necessary to solve them. In 4 years as President, I've learned a great deal about myself, and I've learned a great deal about this country. I've learned that it's not always enough just to be right. We must set priorities on the most important work, [or] it may not ever be done."", ""We need to make sure that the people understand our programs and our policies and our commitments and then build a consensus among the people of this Nation to get your support. We've learned to do that, and the best example, I think, of our success is in energy, which has been the most serious domestic challenge that I have had to face. Four years ago, think back: Most people were led to doubt that there even was an energy problem. Today we lead the world in dealing with this severe challenge."", ""There's another reason for confidence in addition to energy, and that is that during my term in office we've been able to address many other challenges—economic deregulation, where we ended regulation after many, many Presidents, Republicans and Democrats, had promised to do so, and brought competition to the airline, railroad, trucking, banking, and finance industries. We've cut Government paperwork by 15 percent. In education, where we've made a 73-percent increase in our investment in the next generation of Americans, we've kept the Federal Government's nose out of the local schools, public and private. And we now have a situation in the United States where no young American who's able to do college work will ever again be deprived of a college education, no matter how poor their family might be."", ""And in defense we reversed a 7-year decline under Republican administrations and began a steady, balanced, wellplanned increase in our ability to defend our country and defend our interests. In these and other areas, then, we've laid a foundation for further progress. We've paid a short-term price, for that's the nature of investing in our Nation's future. Today's sacrifice will bring tomorrow's security. Our investment will begin to pay rich dividends over the next 4 years if we stay on course."", ""My broad objectives, then, in my second term, can be stated quite simply: Security at home. We'll continue to have a nation whose national defense capability is second to none. Second is peace aboard. I'm the first President in 50 years who can make this statement: Since I've been in the White House our Nation has been at peace. We have not had war. And my commitment for the next 4 years, with God's help, is to continue that record."", ""These goals are more difficult to attain than they are to state, but attain them we shall. Security at home also means energy security. It means economic security for our Nation, for each of us, and our families. It means the security of knowing that our rights as Americans are guaranteed. We've put into place the first comprehensive energy program in our history. It's already helped us to reduce imports of foreign oil by one-third in the last year alone. This day we have more oil drillrigs running in the United States than ever before in history. This year we'll bring in more oil and gas wells than any year in history. This year we will produce more American coal than any year in history, and we will also export more coal than any year in history. We are making good progress. That's the kind of base on which we .can build for the future."", ""And I'm glad to say that Americans are now conserving more energy. And as I look at this beautiful farmland around me, I can tell you that part of the production of fuel in the future will come directly or indirectly from the Sun. Two years ago we had no gasohol production in this country to speak of. This year we'll have 135 million gallons, and by the end of 1981 we'll produce in our Nation 500 million gallons of gasohol from growing crops of the rich land that God gave us to take care of."", ""This commitment to the future, to continue the progress we've made, using the great technology and the natural resources of our country are very important to you and to me. The inflationary forces that have swept the world are far from vanquished, as you know. Last year OPEC oil prices went up more in one year than oil had increased in price since oil was first discovered in the 1800's. The first quarter this year the inflation rate was 18 percent; Second quarter, 13 percent; this quarter just completed, down to 7 percent—still too high, still too high. We must build on the progress that we've made in deregulation, in cutting government spending growth."", ""We've cut the rate of increase of government spending more than 50 percent since I've been in office, and as a part of the gross national product we've also cut the Federal deficit by 50 percent since I've been in office. And we've changed the relationship between labor and management in the basic steel industry, the coal industry, the automobile industry, and others, where now instead of just arguing with each other every 3 years about the terms of a labor contract, now government, management, labor work together to strengthen those basic elements of the prosperity of our country in the future."", ""I want to continue the economic revitalization effort that I've already proposed and started to increase the productivity of our economy and sharpen our technological edge in the world marketplace. One of the greatest allies that any President could have in Washington in forging for the future a successful industrial complex, to increase American productivity with sound tax programs, good investment in new tools and new plants, new jobs, is Senator Lloyd Bentsen. He's my ally in Congress. His proposals will be put into effect. He and I work closely as partners to give you and all of our families a better life. This is the only way I know to fight inflation and to put Americans to work by the millions, in new jobs, with new tools, new factories, in fact, in entire new industries that many Americans cannot even envision yet."", ""We've also made great strides in the last 4 years in the protection of the quality of our air, to keep it pure, our water, to keep it clean, and our land, to keep it unspoiled and productive, in safety of workers and the healthfulness of workers. In the next 4 years we must tackle and solve another problem that hasn't been addressed yet, and that's the long neglected and increasingly serious environmental problem of toxic wastes, poisons that have in the past been dumped in our soils and in our streams, both nuclear materials and also others that must be controlled. We can do it. And we've already made progress now in making plans for the future. A superfund bill has passed the House and is now before the Senate for consideration. There are few things that we could do that would have a more beneficial effect on the long-term health of our people."", ""I want to increase the productivity of our land and expand the agricultural markets around the world, to honor the stewardship of our farm families, and to enrich our own people and others with America's bountiful harvest. I'm a farmer. My people have lived in this country since the early 1600's. Every generation of my family have been farmers—my father was a farmer, his father, and all the way back since they first came to this Nation as settlers."", ""I've chosen as the Secretary of Agriculture a man who's also a dirt farmer, and one difference between Republicans and Democrats is who they choose to be the Secretary of Agriculture. I didn't choose, as Republicans have done, a member of the board of directors of a major processing plant that buys farmers' products cheap at harvest season and sells them high to consumers later on. I chose a man who knows what it means to plow a mule and to plow a tractor and has given you a better life."", ""And if you'll allow me one more minute I'd like to point this out. I've seen in my early days and also since I've been home from the Navy, as a farmer, that quite often we've had to sell our crops at harvest time at whatever price prevailed. Later the middleman made a lot of profit and cheated the consumers in the process. But Bob Bergland and I have seen the difference that ought to be made, and we've increased farm storage by 2.8 billion bushels to encourage farmers to take their grain at harvest time, to store it and to keep it and then to sell it when the market was right. This has paid rich dividends already."", ""In just 3 1/2 years we've seen the greatest increase in gross income for farmers in the history of this country, the greatest increase in net income for farmers in the history of this country, and we've opened up overseas markets that our Nation never dreamed would be. As a matter of fact, we set a world record on exports in 1977. We broke that record in 1978. We broke it again in 1979, and this year we've had the greatest increase in exports in history, $8 billion increase. This year we'll sell $40 billion worth of American farm products overseas. That's a great record. We're going to continue it in the next 4 years."", ""I'd like to mention a word that you might think strange around Abilene, Texas, but it affects your life, and that's China. We opened up diplomatic relations with China 2 years ago, a billion people, one-fourth of the total population of the world. We've doubled trade with Taiwan since it happened. But let me tell you just a minute about China. Recently we sold enough wheat to China every year to produce 15 loaves of bread for every one of those billion people every year. Six to nine million tons of grain will go to China every year for the next 5 years."", ""Texas produces a lot of cotton. You know what nation is the biggest and best customer for the United States in the world today? China. Already. And they're just getting started in demanding products from us. Mexico is your neighbor. In the last 4 years we have tripled trade with Mexico. This year we'll sell Mexico 10 million tons of American grain. Those programs were hammered out not with agricultural specialists from major colleges. They were hammered out by Bob Bergland and me working with farmers and with organizations of farmers to make sure that agriculture remains the basis for the economy and the economic growth of America in the future."", 'Another thing I want to say about the future is this: In the next 4 years I want to help our country achieve a long deferred dream of the Democratic Party and the American people, a national health plan, a plan that emphasizes prevention of disease, a plan that gives care for mothers, both before and after their babies are born, that protects families with catastrophic health insurance from being financially destroyed if a family member is sick for a long time, a plan that would put a limit on how much hospital costs can increase. These kinds of commitments would give America better health and would cost much less than health care costs today.', 'In the next 4 years I want to see equal rights for American women guaranteed where the rights of Americans are supposed to be guaranteed, in the Constitution of the United States.', ""I'd like to stop and say a word about that. It might make my speech a little longer, but I think it's important, because I come from a very conservative region of our Nation. A lot of people have been misled about the equal rights amendment, but let me tell you just in a few words what it means. My mother, Lillian, is a working woman. During the Depression years, she was a registered nurse. She worked 12 hours a day for $4 a day. And sometimes when she was lucky she worked 20 hours a day and got paid $6 for it. She helped our family a lot during the Depression years."", ""Nowadays, a third of our families are headed by women who have to bring home a paycheck to buy food and clothing and shelter for the whole family. Now when a man and woman do the same amount of work, a man gets paid a dollar, and a woman gets paid 59 cents on the average. That's not right. And what the equal rights amendment says is this—it's a very simple amendment. It says: Equality of rights cannot be abridged by the Federal Government or any State government just because the person's a woman. That's all it says. It doesn't say anything about bathrooms. It doesn't say anything about homosexuals. It doesn't say anything about being drafted. It just says that the Federal Government and the State governments have got to stop cheating women. That's all it says."", ""And the last thing I want to mention to you about the future is this: Security at home is obviously important, but it will avail us little if we don't have continued progress toward our other great goal, and that is peace in the world. Real peace is more than just the absence of war. There's something that must be constructed brick by brick through a strong defense and a wise and restrained foreign policy. During the next 4 years, in cooperation with our allies, we will continue the steady strengthening of our conventional and our strategic military forces. We'll strengthen our presence in the vital Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean region, building a system of regional security in that part of the world through diplomacy as well as military strength. That's a major task for the early 1980's."", ""In the Middle East, I want to continue to use our country's good offices to help achieve the dream of a strong and secure Israel living in peace with all her neighbors. This is an ambitious goal, I know, but 4 years ago, no one believed that by 1980 there would be a treaty of peace between Israel and the most powerful Arab country in the world, Egypt. The Camp David process works, and we'll stay with it. The thing is that we're not just doing Israel a favor, because it's a great contribution to our own security to have a strong, secure, democratic, peace-loving Israel in the Middle East."", ""One of the least noticed changes in the last 4 years and one of the most important has been our tremendous improvement in our relationship with the so-called Third World countries, the home of the vast majority of the human race. We've built positive relationships, that I've already mentioned with China, with Nigeria, and other African countries, and with Central and South America. Just to point out the importance of better relations with the Third World, let me remind you that every American who has been killed in action since World War II has died on the soil of a Third World country. In my second term, I want to help our Nation solidify these new relationships by working with them and with their people in promoting economic development, political stability, and basic human rights."", ""Most important of all, during these next 4 years, I want to continue our Nation's efforts to lift the shadow of nuclear annihilation from this Earth. I'm determined to move ahead with balanced and verifiable nuclear arms control. This is crucial to our national security, to our leadership of the Western Alliance, to our efforts to halt the spread of nuclear bombs to unstable or terrorist regimes and organizations. Our ultimate goal is nothing less than to turn the attention of the whole world from the works of war to the works of peace."", ""When Americans went to the Moon and turned their eyes back to Earth, we saw our planet for what it is: a beautiful, fragile spaceship in which all of us, all 4 billion of us, must travel together. In the coming decade, all the people of the Earth, increasingly, will face problems like environmental decay, resource depletion, and hunger. There are going to be conflicts, tensions, pressures, and they'll be intense. The sooner we stop fighting each other and start fighting these common enemies of all human beings, the more likely it will be that we can survive and to prosper."", ""All these efforts to build security at home and peace abroad will be affected by your choice next Tuesday. I appreciate what you've done in the last few years. I congratulate you and I thank you. You've given this party, the Democratic Party, your contributions in your hearts, but none of us can walk away satisfied that we've fulfilled our obligations. The job is not yet over. You still must have a willingness to contribute your leadership, your dedication, your energy, and your spirit. We've only got a few days now to make a decision. It will affect your life. It'll affect the future of your family; it'll affect the future of the people that you love. It'll affect the future of the country that you love."", ""It's nice and I appreciate your coming out here this afternoon. Many of you have made financial contributions, maybe worked in campaign organizations for candidates who are Democrats, and I thank you for that too. But now, these next few hours, as we approach the final deadline for deciding the future, I'd like to ask you to do more. I'd like to ask you to stop and think about the consequences to you and your family if you should wake up Wednesday morning and find that a Republican will be in the Oval Office the next 4 years. Think about it. The choice will be yours. The choice will be yours."", 'Think back in 1948, how just a few votes if they had changed would have prevented Harry Truman from ever serving as President in his term. Just think back to 1960, when John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were on the Democratic ticket. If 28,000 people in Texas had voted differently and just a few thousand in Illinois, John Kennedy would never have been President, and Lyndon Johnson, perhaps, never would have had a chance to. serve this country either. Those two stories came out well. But think about 1968. If just a few Democrats the last few hours had done a little more work, we would have had a great Democratic President and Richard Nixon would never have embarrassed this country in the White House.', ""So, now it's up to you. There's not a single person in this great audience that can't reach at least a hundred other people between now and Tuesday. Some of you might reach a thousand. Some might reach as many as 10,000 through the media and so forth. But I'd like to ask you to make a sacrificial effort these next few days to make sure that you and I can remember the past when the Democratic Party served us so well and think about those things in the future that I've outlined to you this afternoon."", ""I thank you for your partnership. God bless you for your past efforts. Let's get together and win on Tuesday and keep this country on the road to peace and prosperity.""]"

Are we going to whip the Republicans next Tuesday? [Applause] Right."", ""It's a great honor for any American to come here to Fort Worth, which was so important in establishing in the consciousness of all people the pioneer spirit of our land, the strength of those who never faltered in the face of danger, who exemplified human courage, the ability to explore for a better life, starting right here, the starting point of the Chisholm Trail, on the way to Chicago and the great markets. And I'm very glad to see that you're still on the cutting edge of American industry and business and progress in Fort Worth. This historic area is now being rebuilt and preserved by the close cooperation of my administration, Jim Wright, the local officials. It's typical of what Fort Worth has been in the past and the greater future you have ahead of you in the years ahead, and I'm glad to be part of it."", ""You know, the world has suffered the last 4 years since I've been President. We've had terrible ravages of inflation in almost every nation on Earth. In Israel the inflation rate is 200 percent. A lot of communities around the world have inflation rates over 100 percent. Unemployment, very high. They've had no employment growth in Germany, France, Great Britain. But I notice in this Nation in the last 4 years we've added almost 9 million new jobs for American workers, in Texas alone, 914,000 new jobs, in Dallas and Fort Worth area, 294,400 brand new jobs, in the Fort Worth city limits, 46,000. That's the kind of country we've got."", ""God has blessed us in this Nation. You might look back on past times and just think about how they were, compared to what we experience now, with the blessings God's given us. What's happened right here, in kind of a revitalization of the historic treasure of our country, is typical of what has happened."", ""I was born in 1924. I grew up on a farm in south Georgia, and I remember what happened in my own life in those last 50 years since Democrats were in the cutting edge of helping working families and the poor and the elderly and those that didn't have good education. My family have lived in this country since the 1600's. Every one of us have been farmers. My father never had a chance to finish high school. Neither did his father. As a matter of fact, I'm the first one in my family that ever had a chance to finish high school."", ""I grew up on a farm, as I say, and when Franklin Roosevelt came into office, we were facing despair and poverty. He thought that working families ought to be treated in a decent way, and he put electric lights in our farmhouse. Republicans were against the REA, the TVA program. They said it was socialism, communism. Franklin Roosevelt thought that a working man or a working woman ought to have a decent wage to buy food, clothing, shelter for their children, so he put forward the first minimum wage, 25 cents an hour. The Republicans were against it. They didn't think that a working man or woman was worth 25 cents an hour. They said it was communism, socialism, to have the Government tell an employer to pay a man or woman 25 cents. I got my first job as high school graduate in 1941. Minimum wage, 10 hours a day, I had to furnish my own car and pay the expenses, 40 cents an hour. The Democrats put it forward. It was a great advance. Republicans were against it."", 'Franklin Roosevelt thought that older people when they reached retirement age ought to have some security in life, ought to have some chance for self-respect, so he proposed social security. Republicans said it was communism, socialism. Democrats passed it into law. Later on in 1961 the Democrats thought that older people ought to have Medicare, put forward the program. Republicans opposed it.', ""My opponent in this election, Governor Reagan, got his start in politics working for the medical lobby, traveling around this country telling people that Medicare was socialized medicine, and this country was going to be taken over by socialists. This kind of historic background I tell at the beginning of my talk, because I think it's good for you—remember that things don't change very much. You're approaching a major decision next Tuesday. And I don't want you to forget historically what has happened."", ""You've been listening lately to Governor Reagan speak, and you know, if you saw the Republican Convention, that he's been trying to wrap himself in the mantle of great Democratic Presidents. Let me ask you a question. Have you ever in your life heard a Republican candidate for President quote a Republican President?AUDIENCE. No!"", ""THE PRESIDENT. No, you haven't. No, you haven't, and I'll tell you why."", ""They talk like Democrats just before election day and try to mislead the voters of this Nation. And then when they get in office, they act like all the other Republicans have always acted, and so they never do anything or say anything that's worthy of quoting later on."", 'It\'s surprising how many working people in this country get misled every 4. years by the high-paid song and dance Republicans put on. Franklin Roosevelt understood it. I\'d like to read you what he said in 1944—listen to this—Roosevelt\'s words: ""The whole purpose of Republican oratory these days seems to be to switch labels."" ""Now, imitation,"" he said, ""may be the sincerest form of flattery, but I\'m afraid that in this case, it\'s the most obvious common or garden variety of fraud."" Roosevelt knew what he was talking about.', 'The same thing happened in 1960. You remember it, when John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were heading the Democratic ticket, Republicans doing the same thing, here\'s what John Kennedy said of the Republicans: ""They\'re even beginning to say a few kind words about Franklin Roosevelt. Twenty years from now, they may even speak a good word for Harry Truman, but I guarantee you that Truman will never say a good word about Republicans."" As you know, that prediction came true. The Republicans almost fooled Democratic voters in 1960, It was that close. You remember it. If 28,000 people in Texas had voted differently and a few thousand in Illinois, John Kennedy would never have been President. Likely, Lyndon Johnson may never have been president, and this country would have suffered because of it.', ""Now, I'll make a prediction to you now. I predict that 20 years from now the Republican candidates will even be saying nice things about Jimmy Carter's second term."", ""Let me quote a few things that Governor Reagan has said. I didn't come here tonight to criticize him particularly, but I just want to quote his words. The Republican candidate said this year, 1980, fascism was really the basis for the New Deal. Now, do you think Roosevelt would have liked that?AUDIENCE. No!"", 'THE PRESIDENT. The Republican candidate this year, 1980, said, ""I\'m opposed to national health insurance. There is no health crisis in America."" And the Republican also said this year about the minimum wage, ""The minimum wage has caused more misery and more unemployment than anything since the Great Depression.""', 'And the Republican candidate this year says that in 1980, that we should threaten a nuclear arms race against the Soviet Union. John Kennedy negotiated the nuclear test ban treaty, and every President since Harry Truman, Republican and Democratic, have known that the awesome power of nuclear destruction and the control of it was a major responsibility of a President until Ronald Reagan changed the policy.', ""Well, you notice that I like to quote Governor Reagan. I would also like to quote your Governor. [Laughter] But I'm afraid that if I did, my mother might wash my mouth out with soap, so I won't do it."", ""Now, I'd like to remind you of this: You've all seen the polls. The election is close. As a candidate for reelection I'll fight all the way to the wire. This campaign does mean a lot to me personally, because I've invested a lot of years of my life in building a foundation now for a greater future for our country. But what matters most is not what it means to the candidates, but it's what it means to millions of Americans around this country just like you. Think about the consequences for a moment in your own life if you wake up Wednesday morning and discover that we'll have a Republican administration for the next 4 years. Think about it."", ""Think about the consequences if they are successful in repealing the minimum wage law. Think about the consequences for working people of an administration hostile to their very basic rights to organize, the consequences to working women of an administration that would deny constitutional protections of the right to equal pay when women do equal work. Think about the consequences to older Americans if Mr. Reagan should be successful in his often-made proposal to make social security voluntary. It would mean the end of social security. And the other night in the debate I notice he said again that for a young person social security payments were a bad investment. The fact is that for a young father or mother starting at the age of 22, making social security payments, they'll get back 3 1/2 times more than they put in by the retirement age. And in addition, as a bonus, they get disability benefits if something happens to them, and if one of them dies the survivor benefits, as you know, help the surviving spouse and all the children till they're 18. Now, the spreading of word by a President (candidate)1 that social security is a bad investment is a direct threat to the security of the aged people of this country."", '1 White House correction.', 'Think about minorities. I\'m from the Deep South. I saw what happened to us in the South with the passage of the voting rights bill, civil rights bill under Lyndon Johnson. It\'s the best thing that ever happened to the Southland. And at the time it passed, Governor Reagan said, • ""The Civil Rights Act is bad legislation."" We would not be having the enormous economic growth, the technological advances, prosperous farms, a better life, if we had still around us the stigma of racial discrimination.

Think about American agriculture that's grown so well the last few years with a farmer as the Secretary of Agriculture. We've never before seen so much increase in gross income. We've doubled the prices of corn, wheat, beef. We've never had so much of an increase in history in net farm income. We've set a world's record in '77 on exports of 'American farm products, broke that record in '78, broke it again in '79.

You don\'t think about it often. The word is ""China."" We\'ve just signed a contract with China to send them every year enough wheat to make 15 loaves of bread for every one of the 1 billion people who live in that country. And I might point out to you Texans that already China is the number one customer of American cotton. We have tripled trade with Mexico since I\'ve been in the White House. This year we\'ll sell to Mexico 10 million tons of American grain.

But let me tell you what happened the 8 years before I became President. We had two Republican Presidents in the Oval Office. In 7 of those years—listen to this—7 out of 8 years our Federal budget for defense went down, in over an 8-year period we had a reduction of 37 percent in American investment in defense."", ""Since I've been in office, with the help of Jim Wright, Lloyd Bentsen, and other members of the Texas delegation, we've had a steady increase every year above and beyond inflation in our Nation's defense.

But we'll also remember that having powerful, advanced, destructive weapons and highly trained men and women in our Armed Forces is not enough. It's how you use America's defense capability that counts."", ""My philosophy is this: We keep the peace with a strong America. And I can say something to you that no President has been able to say in the last 50 years: Since I have been in the White House we have not been at war. We have been at peace.

There was no answer to our potential vulnerability of our ICBM missiles located in silos. Now we have an answer, the mobile MX missile.

I see a nation strong enough to be secure. I see a nation in the pursuit of progress for all its people.

And in 1960 if only 28,000 people in Texas and a few thousand in Illinois had voted differently, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson would never have led this country. And in 1968 if just a few more Democrats the last few hours had done their work, we would have had a great President named Hubert Humphrey, and Richard Nixon would never have served in the Oval Office.

They've been saying there's no way I could carry southwest Missouri, but we're going to show them wrong again in 1980, right? [Applause] There's no doubt that as Harry Truman said many times, the people make a decision in this Nation, and the people's strength is the strength that made him such a great leader, admired now through history as one of the greatest Presidents who ever served this country since its original founding."", ""I want to thank Governor Teasdale and Tom Eagleton for making me feel at home, along with all of you here in Springfield. It's fitting to wind up my campaign on the final day of the election in the home State of this great man, Harry Truman. Missouri has given our Nation a wealth of great leaders, and Senator Tom Eagleton, as you well know, carries on that proud tradition. I'm proud to be his friend on the same ticket with him. I place a great reliance on his support and also on his advice and counsel, and I look forward to working with him for you during the next 4 years."", ""Now, today I come to Springfield for a special reason. In the quiet moment that we have together here, I come to ask you for your support. This has been a long campaign. A lot of people have been confused about what's at stake. As you well know, down through the ages, since before 1948, there's a few months before election time Republican candidates for President always pretend to be Democrats. And if you've been listening to my Republican opponent, Governor Reagan, you know that he's tried to wrap himself in the mantle of great Democratic Presidents."", 'I want to ask you a question, and think about this: Have you ever heard a Republican candidate for President quote a Republican President?AUDIENCE. No!', ""THE PRESIDENT. You never have. Some of you may have watched the Republican convention, when Governor Reagan got the nomination. He quoted Franklin D. Roosevelt. Can you imagine Governor Reagan standing there and quoting Herbert Hoover or Richard Nixon? [Laughter] Of course not. And there's a reason. There's a reason."", ""Some of you are as old as I am. You grew up during the Great Depression. You've seen many 4-year periods come and go, many campaigns for President come and go. Republicans always run like Democrats. But once they're in office in the Oval Office, they govern like Republicans, and by the time their 4 years is over, after they have misled the people enough to get elected, they never have done anything worth remembering and they never have said anything worth quoting."", ""No man who, on four different occasions, has called for the destruction of the social security system, by calling for it to be voluntary, or who in the debate last week said that social security was a bad investment for a young man, has a right to quote Franklin D. Roosevelt. And no man who opposes the minimum wage and called it the most severe contributor to misery and unemployment since anything from the Great Depression has a right to quote Harry Truman. And no person who's failed to support every single nuclear arms limitation agreement has a right to quote John Fitzgerald Kennedy. And no man who campaigned around this Nation against Medicare and called it socialism has any right to quote Lyndon Baines Johnson."", 'You can rewrite the lines in the movie industry, and you can rewrite the lines in the history in some businesses. But there\'s no way to wipe out 20 years of rightwing Republicanism exemplified by Governor Reagan in just a few months before the election time. But this has always been what the Republicans have tried. Everybody\'s recognized it. Back in 1960, this is what John Kennedy had to say about the Republicans. Let me quote him. ""They\'re even beginning to say a few kind words about Franklin Roosevelt. Twenty years from now, the Republicans might even speak a good word about Harry Truman. But he\'ll never say a good word about the Republicans."" As you know, that prediction about Harry Truman has come true.', ""And I'd like to make a prediction to you now. I predict that 20 years from now the Republicans are going to even say a good word about Jimmy Carter's second term."", 'I come here to you as a Democrat, a man proud to be a Democrat. I believe in the heritage and the mission of the Democratic Party, the heritage and the mission of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the heritage and the mission of Harry S. Truman, the heritage and the mission of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the heritage and the mission of Lyndon Baines Johnson. Think back in your own lives what these men have meant to you.', 'I grew up on a farm during the Depression years. I was born in 1924. My father had to work for a living. He never had a chance to finish high school. Neither did his father nor anyone in my family ever finish high school before I was able to do so. My mother was a registered nurse. She had two kinds of duties that she had to perform. One was 12 hours a day. She got paid $4. The other was 20 hours a day. She got paid $6 for that—it was a lot of money for her and for a working family during the Depression. I remember that Franklin Roosevelt and the Democrats came forward with the idea of a minimum wage, 25 cents an hour. They thought that a grown man or a grown woman trying to care for a family, to buy food, clothing, pay for housing deserved 25 cents an hour. Republicans were against it. They called it socialism, some said communism, for the Government to try to say that a sweatshop was not proper in the free enterprise system.', ""I remember that older people, when I was young, that didn't have a rich family went to what we called the po' folks farm and lived in embarrassment and abject poverty the rest of their lives. Franklin Roosevelt felt, along with Harry Truman, that the older people who had served our country with a great life and dedicated work ought to have some security in their old age. They ought to have some selfrespect, ought to have some human dignity. So, the Democrats put forward the idea of social security. Republicans were against it. They said it was socialism, some said communism, to let the Government interfere in the private right of citizens to be poor when they're old."", ""We didn't have electricity on my farm. We didn't have running water, till I was 13 or 14 years old. Franklin Roosevelt felt that the farmers deserved an equal break. He put forward the idea of the TVA and the REA. Finally, we got electricity on our farm in 1937. Republicans were against it. They said it was socialism, communism, for the Federal Government to interfere in the right of the private power companies to have a monopoly on the distribution of power."", ""Later on, in the early 1960's, Democrats came forward with Medicare. My opponent Governor Reagan got his start in politics campaigning around this country against Medicare. He called it socialized medicine, socialism. Some even said, communism. Republicans were against it. The Democrats put in that guarantee that at least older people could have some rights to decent health care."", ""Down through the ages, for the last 50 years at least, every great advance has been made for working people, for farmers, for the elderly, for young people to get a better education, from social security to Medicare, from collective bargaining to the minimum wage, every time the Republicans have been against it. They haven't changed. Not at all. But they tend to mislead the people just before an election, and because they have enormous campaign contributions from the rich, they can dominate the radio and the television, and they can send out a false message which quite often misleads people. And a lot of times the people don't wake up until the morning after the election and realize that next January there's going to be another Republican sitting in the Oval Office."", 'There is no way that Republicans can win an election in this country. There are only about 30 percent of them. What costs the Democrats the election: the Democrats who forget history and who forget how their own lives and the lives of their families, and the lives of people you love are affected by the outcome of an election. This is a very important thing for us to remember during these last few hours before election time.', ""Democrats have always believed in a strong defense. We've always believed that that strong defense capability should be recognized in order to preserve the peace. For the last 8 years before I became President, Republicans let our defense establishment go down 7 out of 8 of those years—37 percent reduction in budgeted funds for defense. But we have kept our Nation strong and we've also kept our Nation as all Americans want it."", ""In the last 50 years, no president can make the statement that I'm just now going to make to you.' For the last 4 years, since I have been in office, our Nation has not been at war; our Nation has been at peace."", ""My background is as a trained military officer. I served 11 years in the Navy. I went to the Naval Academy. I was a submarine officer. And when I got in the Oval Office I was dedicated to restoring to our Nation its military strength. But I'm also a father and I'm a grandfather, and as President I'll always remember this: The best weapon is one that never has to be fired in battle; the best soldier is one that never has to shed his blood on the field of battle. We'll keep our Nation strong, but we'll keep it at peace."", ""As you know from having observed Harry Truman in office, and other Democratic Presidents, that Presidents have to make decisions in times of trouble and in times of crisis. I've not served in the Oval Office a single day that there wasn't trouble somewhere on Earth, armed conflict, the possibility of war. But I've had to make a judgment in each instance about what are our Nation's interests, what degree of involvement should I order in order to use the tremendous strength of our Nation? Should I try to resolve those difficulties peacefully with strength, diplomatically, politically, or should I try to resolve them by sending American boys into war? That judgment has to be made by a President, with the strength of belief in our Nation's honor, with an understanding of what our Nation's desires are, and with a calm assurance and a careful, moderate approach to potential crises."", ""If a President deals with a crisis properly the chances are that you never know about it. But if a President makes a misjudgement, that crisis can affect your life and affect the life, perhaps, of every human being on Earth. Our greatest commitment, ever since Harry Truman was in office, by Presidents, Democratic and Republican, has been to control nuclear war, prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to radical nations like Libya and Iraq and others, to have a careful, balanced, verifiable control of nuclear arms. It's the greatest overriding issue of this campaign. The greatest legacy we can leave our children is a nation more peaceful, more dedicated to the pursuit of peace. The election of 1980 is really a choice not just between two candidates or even two parties but a choice between two futures."", ""Let me talk very briefly in closing about the kind of future that you and I can have. In the next 4 years, together we can build a nation strong and keep it strong, but also keep our Nation at peace. And we can also build peace far beyond the next administration in the years and the decades and the generations ahead, a nation that's secure, confident of itself, secure in its defense, secure in its energy needs, a nation of new technology, new factories, new tools, new jobs, whole new industries based on a new energy program about which we cannot even dream yet, a nation of new energy sources, where Americans can house themselves and propel themselves down the highways, through the skies, over the rails, with energy efficiency, yes, but with energy derived from the farms and the mines of America, a nation that stands for human rights here at home and throughout the world. These goals that I've described to you so briefly are not just dreams. They're the things that we can accomplish."", ""My background is as a farmer. All the generations of my family since they first came to this country in the late 1600's have been farmers. And I'm very proud of what we've done. I can't pass by a visit to Missouri without mentioning agriculture."", ""When I became President I saw the mistakes that had been made under Nixon, Ford, and Earl Butz. I was determined to bring in the Secretary of Agriculture, a dirt farmer, Bob Bergland, who understood, as I did, how farmers needed a new life. I remember when we used to have to sell our crops at harvest time, when the prices were at the bottom. Our crops, our grain, our cotton, and everything else, was bought at that time when the prices were low and the middleman, the bigshot processors, made all the profits. When a Republican President's elected his Secretary of Agriculture almost invariably is some representative of the food processors, of the middleman. The agriculture farmer gets left behind. We've changed that. We've built on our farms since I've been in office 2.8 billion bushels of storage space. Now the farmers at harvest time can keep their crops, can watch the market, can sell the crops when it's best for them. This helps the consumer too. It presents [prevents]1 the wild fluctuations up and down in the price of basic grains."", '1White House correction.', ""What's been the result? In the last 3 1/2 years we've had bumper crops. One year we had record crops in five different categories. But we've not had the farmers suffer. The prices in 1977 for feed grains were just about double; price for beef, just about double. Gross income in the last 4 years has increased more than ever before in history. Net income for farm families the last 4 years has increased more than it ever has in history. We set a record in 1977 in exports to foreign countries of American farm crops; 1978, we broke that record; 1979, we broke it again. This year we've had the biggest increase in history, $8 billion increase over last year. We'll export $40 billion worth of American farm products to foreign countries. This is the kind of record we've had. And as we approach 1981 to write a new farm bill to replace the 4-year bill of 1977, I want to be sure that we have a farmer in the White House, a farmer in the Secretary of Agriculture's office, and we work with farmers and farm organizations as we did in 1977 to give agriculture a new boost in the future. That's what we've got to do."", ""And I know Missouri is also a great industrial State now. After 1945, at the end of the Second World War, when Harry Truman was President, the United States rebuilt the industry of Western Europe. We rebuilt the industry of Germany, and I tell you now that we've got an energy policy in place it's time for us to rebuild the industry of the United States of America, and that's what we're going to do."", ""Well, I think I need not pursue any further the difference between our two parties and our vision of the future. Let me remind you once again that the responsibility is in your hands. I know all of you have contributed a lot by coming here this afternoon to meet with me on this last day of the campaign. You've done it at a sacrifice, I know. And some of you have been actively involved in Democratic Party affairs, maybe for a long time. Maybe some of you have even given a financial contribution to pay for the campaigns of some Democratic candidates. That's not enough."", ""Think for a few minutes about what Democrats have meant to you down through the years—Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, Johnson, and others. Think how your lives have been changed and how different it would have been had those great men not ever have served. Think about yourself, your family members, the people that you love, the ones who look to you for leadership, and in this next few days—next few hours—make sure that you do even more than you had anticipated when you came here. There's no one in the sound of my voice that can't reach a hundred people between now and tomorrow when the polling places close. Please do the best you can."", ""You might say, well, one person can't make a difference, but that's not true. Remember those headlines you just saw from the Chicago Tribune. Had just a few people throughout this country voted differently, Harry Truman would never have been reelected President and never have done the great things he did in his full second term. Think about 1960 when John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were on the Democratic ticket. If 28,000 people in Texas had changed their vote and a few thousand had voted differently in Illinois, John Kennedy would never have served as President. Lyndon Johnson, likely, would never have served as President. Those stories wound up well. But think about 1968. If a few more Democrats like you and me had done a little extra work the last 24 hours, had realized what it meant to them, we would have had a great President, as you well know: Hubert Humphrey. And the last Republican President to be elected, Richard Nixon, would never have embarrassed our country in the Oval Office."", 'So, let\'s remember these things tomorrow. I appreciate your great support and the welcome that you\'ve given me here, but I want to quote a man in closing that never had a chance to serve as President because he was killed. The last day he campaigned in 1968 Robert Kennedy had a vision of what this country ought to be. And in Los Angeles he made this speech the last day he lived. He said to the voters on that day, and I quote him, ""I ask you to recognize the hard and difficult road to a better America. The people must decide this election. I ask you to vote for yourselves. For your sake, and for the sake of your children, vote. Vote for yourselves.""Thank you very much.']"

I feel great.', 'Vice President Mondale, Senator Glenn, Senator Howard Metzenbaum, Congressman Seiberling, Congressman Pease,, Congressman Mary Rose Oakar, and distinguished friends from the Akron and Canton region:', ""Let me say this, and I don't want you ever to forget it: Fritz Mondale is the best Vice President any President has ever had. We faced a lot of problems together. We've worked together. We've prayed together pretty often, and tomorrow with your help we're going to win together."", ""This is the first time that Fritz and I have been together to campaign at the same location since the Democratic National Convention, and it's fitting that we should come here in beautiful Ohio, the heartland of the greatest nation on Earth. But let me give you a sober reminder. Tomorrow you will decide what kind of America it will be. I know you've considered the consequences of this election. The vote you cast tomorrow will echo throughout the next 4 years—as a matter of fact, throughout the rest of this century, and nowhere will that echo be more clear than how it affects your lives, the lives of your family, those you love here in the Akron-Canton area."", ""I know there are problems here. We've faced them together. But working with dynamic leaders like John Glenn, Howard Metzenbaum, John Seiberling, and others, we have made a good start on solving these problems. I'm very grateful, for instance, in looking at the statistics, to know that in Ohio we have had, since I've been in the Oval Office as President, an increase in total employment—just in Ohio, 558,000 more people now at work than there were January 1977; in Akron, metropolitan area of Akron, 20,400 people more on the job now than 3 1/2 years ago; in Canton, 18,300 more people at work than there were 3 1/2 years ago. And that's in spite of the fact the last few months, we have had some economic setbacks."", ""We've faced inflation together. The first quarter of this year, because of OPEC price increases, we had an 18-percent inflation rate. The second quarter, we cut it down to 13 percent. This quarter just ended, the average was 7 percent, still too high. But the point is that we're working together to make this a better nation and to make your own community a better place to live. This is important to remember also, because we've had some specific projects that we've worked out together for you—a private government investment of $86 million to build a Goodyear Technical Center, where workers of this area can be trained and retrained for meaningful, good paying jobs. These kind of projects will continue."", ""Tomorrow we honor the Nation's most precious freedom, the right to chart the future of our own country. I'm confident that the Democratic Party can continue to give America the future it deserves. I want to ask you a question. How many of you believe that tomorrow we're going to whip the Republicans all the way across this Nation? [Applause]"", ""Let me give you a reminder of something. There is no way that Republicans can beat us, because there are not enough of them to do it. But we Democrats are the only ones that can beat ourselves by not voting. A low turnout by the working families of this Nation, a low turnout by the farmers of this Nation, a low turnout by those who've been deprived in life and given a better chance by the Democratic Party down through the generations-that's the only thing that can hurt us."", ""If you've been listening to the Republican candidate the last few months, you wouldn't be able to tell what party he belongs to. [Laughter] He's tried to wrap himself in the mantle of great Democratic Presidents. Let me ask you a question. Have you ever heard a Republican candidate for President quote a Republican President?"", 'AUDIENCE. No!', 'THE PRESIDENT. Do you know why?', 'AUDIENCE. Why?', ""THE PRESIDENT. Because every year-you think back on it—I've been watching Presidential elections since the 1930's-every time when the last few months come before an election, the Republican candidate starts trying to act like a Democrat. They comment, they quote Democratic Presidents, but once they get in office, they govern like Republicans, they talk like Republicans, they act like Republicans, they mistreat American citizens like Republicans. So when they go out of office, they haven't left anything there to talk about, they haven't said anything that you want to quote. [Laughter]"", ""I heard the last part of Ronald Reagan's speech when he accepted the nomination at the Republican Convention. He quoted Franklin D. Roosevelt. Can you imagine Ronald Reagan standing up there and quoting Herbert Hoover or Richard Nixon? [Laughter] Of course not. And I'll say this, too. I don't like it much because no man who says the New Deal was based on fascism has a right to quote Franklin D. Roosevelt. And no man who has always been and still is in favor of abolishing the minimum wage has a right to quote Harry Truman. And no man who has failed to support every single nuclear arms limitation agreement since the Second World War has a right to quote John Fitzgerald Kennedy. And no man who calls Medicare socialism and communism has a right to quote Lyndon Baines Johnson."", 'Now, you can rewrite the record in some professions or in some businesses, but you can\'t, with a discerning American electorate, rewrite 20 years of ultra-conservatism under the Republican banner in the last few months before an election takes place. John Kennedy, back in 1960, sized it up pretty well. He saw the same phenomenon then, same thing in \'64, \'68, \'72, \'76, same thing today. This is what John Kennedy said. ""They\'re even beginning,"" he said about the Republicans, ""to say a few kind words about Franklin Roosevelt. Twenty years from now,"" Kennedy said, ""they might even speak a good word about Harry Truman, but I guarantee you that Harry Truman won\'t say anything good about Republicans.""

Twenty years from now, I predict that the Republicans are going to be saying good things about Jimmy Carter\'s second term.', ""I'm proud to be a Democrat. I believe in the heritage and the mission of the Democratic Party. I grew up on a farm during the Depression years, and I saw how the Democrats changed my life. Democrats have been for the progressive changes for the working people of this Nation, every decade, every election, every generation. Don't be misled by Republicans who try to change their spots just before election day. Remember the heritage of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Think for a moment. Remember the heritage of Harry Truman. Remember the heritage of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Remember the heritage of Lyndon Baines Johnson. Remember the heritage of Hubert Humphrey. Every great advance in our country the last half century, from collective bargaining to the minimum wage, from social security to Medicare, civil rights, quality of life—every single one of them has been made by the Democratic Party. And the Democrats have always been opposed by the same basic Republican commitment and philosophy, quite often the same people in every one of these progressive issues."", ""But we in the Democratic Party are not just a party of past accomplishments. We are the party of the future. The Democratic Party is the party that fights for the interests of working people. The Democratic Party is one that fights to protect the quality of our life, that protects the health and security and the self-respect of elderly Americans, that supports national health insurance for all Americans, that supports human rights for people in this country and around the world, including equal rights for women guaranteed in the Constitution of the United States. And we are also the party that's strong enough and sure enough to dare to work for peace."", ""Now, those are our goals as Democrats, and we're going to fight for them together for the next 4 years.

We have been at peace; and with your help we will keep this Nation at peace for the next 4 )'ears. But peace is something that must be built, step by step, brick by brick. Every day that I've been in office there've been dangers, there have been conflicts, there have been serious problems or troubled areas somewhere in the world. Each time I've had to make critical judgments: What are America's real interests? What degree of involvement should our Nation have in resolving those troubles or those crises? How should we use our Nation's tremendous strength?"", ""I'm a father. I'm a grandfather. And as President, I will always remember to keep our Nation strong militarily, yes, second to none, but I also will always remember that the best weapon is one that never must be fired in battle and the best soldier is one that need never lay his life down or shed his blood on the field of battle."", ""Presidents have to make judgments when troubles come. If the crisis is well-handled, our Nation's interests are protected, the crisis passes, perhaps sometimes without your even knowing about it. But if a President makes a misjudgment, it can affect your lives and the life of everyone on Earth. I'm proud that our Nation has helped to achieve a treaty of peace between Israel and her most powerful Arab neighbor—the first peace ever between Israel and an Arab country.

Peace is my passion, and with your support for the next 4 years, maintaining this Nation at peace is my pledge to you."", ""In closing, I want to make a special statement that I've not made before in this campaign. I want to say a few words directly to those citizens in this country who share the goals that I've just described to you, but who are considering a vote tomorrow for Congressman John Anderson. Obviously, there are some differences between us. But on many of the key issues of this campaign, like the need for energy conservation, pure air, clean water, controlling the spread of nuclear weapons, keeping our Nation at peace, the equal rights amendment, our views are very close. And the most overriding issue of all, the issue of peace and the control of nuclear weapons and preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to terrorist countries and to other nations that don't now have the atomic bomb—on this great fundamental issue, all of the candidates are on one side except that Governor Reagan is on the other side."", 'I ask you to consider the consequences to your lives if you should wake up Wednesday morning and find a new administration ready to take over the Oval Office, not committed to these goals, if they can control our country for the next 4 years.

Those are two stories that ended with a happy ending. But think about 1968: Because some of us, divided because of Gene McCarthy and the Chicago convention, didn't give our support to a great American, Hubert Humphrey never had a chance to serve as President and Richard Nixon, if we had just worked a little bit, would never have served as the last Republican President to be elected to serve in this country.

It'll help all of the people of the whole Nation."", ""And as you know, my administration has also been very concerned about and interested in the steel industry. We've now put a plan in effect nationwide, with management, with the steelworkers, and with my administration, to help this industry and all those who work in it. It's already making great progress."", ""Granite City has seen this at firsthand. Your steelplants are now committed, as you know, to major expansion in the months and years ahead, and EPA has just reached an agreement with Granite City Steel that will protect the quality of our environment and at the same time will protect the jobs of thousands of workers here, now and in the future. That's the kind of progress that we're going to make in the years ahead."", ""Let me ask you one question. How many of you know that tomorrow we're going to whip the Republicans? [Applause] There is no way that the Republicans can win an election. There's not enough of them. But there is a way the Democrats can lose an election—by not going out between now and the end of the voting time tomorrow and using your influence and your voice and your vote to make sure that we have a victory. We're the ones, as working families, that can lose the election. We're the ones, as farmers, that can lose the election. We're the ones, as senior citizens, who might lose this election. We're the ones, who have been deprived of a good life in the past, but given one by Democratic leaders in years gone by, who might lose the election."", ""Republicans cannot beat us, but if we don't work hard these last few hours, we might very well beat ourselves. And I'd like to remind you of how the working families will feel, how the elderly will feel, how the farmers will feel if we wake up Wednesday morning and find that for the next 4 years we'll have Republicans in the White House. That would be the worst thing that can happen. Let's don't let it happen."", ""If you've noticed, lately my Republican opponent, Ronald Reagan, has been doing the best he could to sound like a Democrat. I want to ask you a question. Have you ever heard a Republican candidate for President quote a Republican President?"", 'AUDIENCE. No!', ""THE PRESIDENT. No, you haven't. Some of you watched the Republican convention, and you heard Ronald Reagan quoting Franklin D. Roosevelt. Can you imagine Ronald Reagan standing there and quoting Herbert Hoover and Richard Nixon?AUDIENCE. No!"", ""THE PRESIDENT. Okay, there's a reason for it, because it happens every 4 years. Every 4: years, the Republican candidates for President try to make the working families, the farmers, the elderly, and others forget the difference between Democrats and Republicans. This has caused America several times to make serious mistakes until it's too late, after election day, to realize what's happened."", ""A man who says that the New Deal was based on fascism hasn't got any right to quote Franklin Delano Roosevelt. A man who opposes and has always opposed, and who now suggests that it be repealed, the minimum wage has no right to quote Harry Truman. And no man who failed to support the limited arms agreement, the antiballistic missile agreement, the limited test ban agreement, SALT I, the Vladivostok agreement, every single nuclear arms limit—no man who opposed all of those has any right to quote John Fitzgerald Kennedy. And no man who campaigned all over this Nation, as Governor Reagan did, fighting against Medicare, calling it socialism, has any right to quote Lyndon Baines Johnson."", ""Now, you can rewrite the lines in motion picture scripts, and you can rewrite the lines in the records sometimes in business or professions, but there's no way that a rightwing Republican with a 20-year record in public affairs, his statements on the record, can change his spots the last 3 or 4 months before election and get away with it. But they always try."", 'Back in 1960, this is what John Kennedy said about this exact same thing, and I\'d like to quote John Kennedy. This is what he said about the Republicans: ""They\'re even beginning to say a few kind words about Franklin Roosevelt. Twenty years from now,"" Kennedy said, ""they might even speak a good word about Harry Truman. But I guarantee you that Harry Truman won\'t say a good word about Republicans."" As you well know, that prediction came true.', ""And I'd like to make a prediction to you this afternoon. I predict that 20 years from now the Republican candidates for President are going to be saying nice things about Jimmy Carter's second term."", 'Like many of you, I grew up during the Depression years. I lived on a farm. My mother was a registered nurse. She had two different kinds of jobs during the Depression. One was 12 hours a day on duty; she made $4. The other times, when she was a little more fortunate, she worked 20 hours a day on duty, away from home, and she brought home $6. The Democrats cared about people like my mother, and so they proposed a minimum wage, 25 cents an hour. The Republicans were against it. They said it was socialism, communism for the Federal Government to interfere between employees in the sweatshops and employers who owned the companies.', 'Later, when I finished high school in 1941, I got my first job working for the Government, measuring land. I got paid 40 cents an hour, a big increase from 25 cents up to 40 cents. The Republicans were against it, but the Democrats prevailed. My life was like a lot of yours.', ""When senior citizens reached the retirement age, if they didn't have a family that could support them, they went to what was called the po' folks farm. Franklin Roosevelt and the Democrats cared about senior citizens, and they put forward the idea of social security. The Republicans were against it. They called it socialism, communism to have an insurance program paid for by working people to give them some security in their retired age and some sense of self-respect and human dignity."", ""My father never had a chance to finish high school; neither did his father nor any other man in my family before I came along. My daddy had to work from before daylight until dark, because we didn't have electricity on our farm. The Democrats felt that farmers ought to have a better life and put forward the idea of the TVA and the REA. The Republicans were against it. They called it socialism, communism, and an interference in the free enterprise system and the major companies that sold power in those days."", ""This has not changed down through the years, but every time before an election year Republicans try to make us forget those things. I see some young people over here on the side with signs holding up for Governor Reagan. They don't remember those years, and they don't know the historical difference between Democrats and Republicans that never change. They don't know how many times the Republicans have tried to mislead Democrats just before election year."", ""Governor Reagan hasn't changed. He says the minimum wage has caused more misery and more unemployment than anything in this Nation since the Great Depression. He says that unemployment compensation is a prepaid vacation for freeloaders. He says, just like he did about Medicare, that national health insurance is a symbol of socialism, and he's against it. And as you know, this policy of his is typical of the Republicans."", ""But we are also a nation that believes in a strong military, and the Democrats have put forward in the last 4 years, with the help of Mel Price and others, a repair of our Nation's defense. I believe in a strong defense, but let me tell you this. In the last 50 years no President has been able to make the next statement that I'm going to make to you: For the last 4 years, since I have been in office, our Nation has not been at war; we have been at peace. And with your help, we'll keep our Nation strong and at peace for the next 4 years. But peace is not something that comes automatically; it has to be built piece by piece, brick by brick."", ""Every day that I've been in office, somewhere in the world there has been a crisis, there has been armed conflict, there's been a trouble spot. There've been dangers, yes. But I have known, as many of you, that the President of the United States is the one that must make a decision. What are the real interests of America? How should we protect those interests? What degree of involvement should we pursue? Should we try to solve those troubles peacefully, politically, diplomatically, or should we inject our military forces in the war?"", ""I'm a father; I'm a grandfather. And as President I'll always remember this: Keep our Nation strong, yes; but the best weapon is one that need never be fired in battle, and the best soldier is one that need never shed his blood on the field of battle."", ""And I'm proud that our Nation, not only keeping ourselves at peace, has been able to spread the benefits of peace to others. We brought finally a treaty of peace between Israel and Egypt—the first time ever that Israel has been at peace with any of her Arab neighbors. That's a commitment of the Democratic Party, to bring peace. But I think that you ought to be reminded that the major commitment, the strongest responsibility on the shoulders of every President since Harry Truman, Democratic and Republican, has been to prevent nuclear war."", ""We must continue our progress in the careful, balanced, verifiable control of nuclear weapons. It's the greatest overriding issue of this campaign. The greatest legacy that we can leave our children is a world at peace. Peace is my passion. And with your support for the next 4 years, we'll control nuclear weapons, we'll prevent the radical countries like Libya from having atomic bombs, and we will keep our Nation at peace. That's my pledge to you."", ""And finally, let me say that I'm proud to be a Democrat. I believe in the heritage and I believe in the mission of the Democratic Party, the heritage and the mission of Franklin D. Roosevelt—think back-the heritage and mission of Harry Truman, the heritage and the mission of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the heritage and the mission of Lyndon Baines Johnson, the heritage and the mission of Hubert Humphrey. Every great advance in our Nation, in your lives, for the last half century, from the collective bargaining to the minimum wage, from social security to Medicare, every single one of them has come under Democratic administrations over the opposition of Republicans. Don't forget that for a minute."", ""But the Democratic Party is not just a party of achievement in the past. The Democratic Party has been an organization, with you part of it, that's always looked to the future. The Democratic Party is the party that fights for the interests of working people, that fights to protect the quality of our lives, that protects the health and the security of senior citizens, that supports national health insurance for all Americans, that supports human rights for all people in this country and around the world, and the Democratic Party is a party that supports equal rights for women guaranteed in the Constitution of the United States. These are our goals, and we'll work together for them for the next 4 years."", ""Now, today I'd like to say a special word directly to those citizens of this country who share these goals that I've just outlined to you, but who are considering a vote for Congressman John Anderson. Obviously, there are some differences between me and him, but on many of the key issues of this campaign, like the need for energy conservation, pure air, and clean water, controlling the spread of nuclear weapons, equal rights amendment, our views are very similar one to another. And on the one most important issue of all, the control of nuclear weapons and preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries, on this great fundamental issue, all of the other candidates agree on one side; on the other side is Governor Ronald Reagan."", 'I ask you to consider the consequences of a new administration that is not committed to these goals if they should control our country for the next 4 years. I appeal to you for your dedicated support, your deep commitment during these next few hours as people approach the time to cast their ballots. You might say, ""Well, one person can\'t make a difference. I\'ve come here today, and I\'ve added my voice to the crowd. Maybe I\'ve been involved in the Democratic Party in the past. Maybe I\'ve even been part of a Democratic organization or made campaign contributions. That\'s enough."" But that\'s not enough.', ""The other night I was over in St. Louis at a rally where I reminded people primarily about Harry Truman. In 1948 there was an election, very close. If just a few thousand people around the country had voted differently or had not gone to the polls, Harry Truman would never have been President. In 1960—think back very carefully—if 28,000 people in Texas had voted the other way and a few thousand people in Illinois had voted differently, John Kennedy would never have been President, and Lyndon Johnson, the Civil Rights Act, and the great progress we've made under those two great men would never have come to pass."", ""Those two stories wind up with a happy ending, but let me remind you of another campaign, in 1968, where a few Democrats, maybe some of you and me, didn't work as hard as we should for the Democratic nominee. Hubert Humphrey, a great American with a great heart, never was able to serve as President of this country. And instead we had the last Republican President ever elected to serve in the Oval Office, Richard Nixon. That's the difference that we want to prevent this time."", 'Let\'s remember these events that I\'ve just outlined to you as you leave this great rally. Let\'s remember also the words of another Democrat who might have been President, but who died on his last day of campaigning, and that\'s Robert Kennedy. In 1968, on the last day before he was killed, he made a speech, and this is what he said. And I\'d like to conclude my remarks just by quoting him, because the message that he gave to you is the one I\'d like to give to you today. Robert Kennedy\'s words: ""I ask you to recognize the hard and the difficult road to a better America. I ask you to vote for yourselves. The people must decide this election. For your sake and for the sake of your children, vote, vote, vote for yourselves. Vote for yourselves.""', ""Thank you very much. God bless you. Don't forget to vote for yourselves.""]"

And in 1960, when John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were running as President and Vice President, if only 28,000 people had voted differently in Texas and a few thousand in Illinois, then John Kennedy would never have been President, Lyndon Johnson, and the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act might never have taken place and Richard Nixon would have been President then.

And one of the most delightful experiences I've had as President has been to see the new, modern, efficient, safe, durable automobiles coming out of Michigan, that are going to put those foreign cars off the market, and you can depend on that."", ""Also, it's very important—since Michigan is such a great labor State—it's very important for us to remember, as these last few hours approach before election, the sharp and historical differences that exist between the two parties. Every election year, shortly before the voting comes, the Republican candidates begin to act like Democrats. They try to mislead the American voters with highly financed campaigns from rich people. But all of you know that you have never heard a Republican candidate for President quote a Republican President. They all quote John Kennedy or they all quote Franklin Roosevelt, and there's a reason for it. Because once Republicans get in the Oval Office, they govern like and they act like Presidents [Republicans]. 1 They don't do anything to be remembered later.

I also am very deeply grateful to you for three members of my Cabinet whom you trained for me and let me use in Washington. We've never had a better Secretary of Agriculture than the man that you trained here and sent to Minnesota for a little fine tuning. Bob Bergland has been one who was a radical departure from what the Republicans have done in the past. They've always chosen some executive secretary or some lawyer who represented grain speculators or either processors of food who bought grain and products from farmers cheap during harvest season, and then sold it to consumers high after they manipulated the market. But Bob Bergland has put the farmer of America back in the driver's seat on marketing grain and helping make it possible for us to make all-time records of grain exports, a lot of it shipped from the west coast to China. China is now our number one customer of American cotton and, as you know, the next 5 years we'll be selling China between 6 and 9 million tons of grain from the United States, enough for 15 loaves of bread for every man, woman, and child in the billion people who live in China. That's the kind of Secretary of Agriculture you trained for me."", ""And of course, Cecil Andrus has been a great Secretary of Interior, a good Governor of Idaho, well-trained in Eugene, at the same high school, I understand, that Neil Goldschmidt attended himself.

But you've made a great contribution to the Nation."", ""I might say also that Oregon is important to me because you've been innovators in energy conservation, in urban revitalization, in the conservation of our natural resources, and in standing up for the rights of women. As a matter of fact, Oregon is the only State that's ratified the equal rights amendment, not once, but twice."", ""Recently, when I've been in South Carolina, Mississippi, Tennessee, Florida, I've reminded the people there the real meaning of the equal rights amendment. Our country for 200 years has tried to remove the legal impediments to equal opportunity for all people, and I've told them very frankly what the equal rights amendment means. It doesn't have anything to do with restrooms, doesn't have anything to do with drafting people, doesn't have anything to do with homosexuality. It just says very simply, as you well know, that equality of rights shall not be abridged by the Federal Government nor by any State government because a person is a woman or because of sex. That's all it says. All the equal rights amendment says, in effect, is neither the Federal Government nor the State government any longer will have a right to cheat women. We're going to stop that if I'm elected, but if Ronald Reagan's elected, we'll never have the equal rights amendment. We have got to have it. With your help, we'll do it."", 'Now, I\'m also glad to come to Oregon because you\'re a State that loves trees. Now Ronald Reagan has provided a lot of opportunity for jokes about trees.

You know that very well here in Oregon. And here in your State, you might very well hold the key to this election. All the poll results I\'ve seen show that here in this State the issue is in doubt. The outcome of the election hangs in the balance, with just a few votes one way or the other making a difference. And that\'s why I\'ve crossed this continent tonight, to make my last appearances here and a little bit later tonight in Seattle, before I fly back home to vote in Plains.

Have you ever heard a Republican candidate for President quoting a Republican President? [Shouts] You never heard it. Some of you watched the Republican Convention and heard the acceptance speech by Ronald Reagan. He quoted Franklin Roosevelt. Can you imagine him standing up there and quoting Herbert Hoover or Richard Nixon? [Shouts] It's ludicrous, isn't it?

So I worked hard, along with the Democratic Congress, to repair that damage and to make our Nation strong. There's a reason for it. And you need not be frightened about the fact that our Nation is strong, because I'm able to say for the first time of any President in 50 years, for the last 4 years since I have been in office, our Nation has not been at war; we have been at peace."", ""And we've been at peace because we've kept our Nation strong and because we've addressed the difficult issues that affect our country with caution, with moderation, with determination, and with a calm assurance of our own strength.

Many potential crises come to the man elected to serve this Nation as President. If that issue is handled properly, then the crisis perhaps passes without your ever knowing about it.

Our lakes and our rivers are cleaner than they were. The air is more fit to breathe. We've tripled our investment in solar energy. We've doubled the size of our national park system. We've strengthened the Endangered Species Act. We've created more wilderness areas than in any other administration."", 'By contrast, Governor Reagan scorns energy conservation. He dismisses solar energy as, quote, ""exotic."" He wants to weaken the Clean Air Act and undercut our efforts to promote health and safety in the workplace. Recently, someone said let\'s do away with OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Governor Reagan said, ""Amen.""', ""It's a clear choice. Only the Democrats will continue and strengthen that commitment to a decent environment. Only the Democrats recognize that we can have jobs for our people through our economic revitalization program without sacrificing the air we breathe and the water we drink."", ""The election of 1980 is a choice between two futures. Let me close my remarks by saying very briefly what kind of future you and I can have. In the next 4 years, together, we can build a nation at peace-a building of a peace for the future, not just 4 years, but for the rest of this century; a nation secure, secure in its defense, secure in its energy needs; a nation of new technology, new factories, new tools, whole new industries that we may not have even dreamed about yet; a nation of new energy sources where American coal and the production of American land replaces OPEC oil; a nation that stands for human rights and is not afraid to say so. These goals are not just idle dreams, they can and must be an agenda for the Democrats and for this Nation. And as long as I'm President, that's the agenda that we will follow."", ""I'm proud to be a Democrat. I believe in the heritage and the mission of the Democratic Party. Some of you here are as old as I am, and you remember how your lives were changed beneficially by the heritage and the mission of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, by the heritage and the mission of Harry Truman, by the heritage and the mission of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, by the heritage and the mission of Lyndon Baines Johnson, and by the heritage and the mission of Hubert Humphrey."", ""Every great advance in our country for half a century, from collective bargaining to the minimum wage, from social security to Medicare, every single one of them has been made possible by the Democratic Party. Now, with the election just a few hours away, now it's clearer than ever to me that the winner tomorrow will be either myself or Ronald Reagan."", ""Tonight I want to say a word directly to those Oregonians who might still be considering a vote for John Anderson. On many of the key issues, on many of the key issues, I'm sure that you, young people in college and others, issues like energy conservation, equal rights for women, protecting our air and water and, above all, the overriding issue of nuclear arms control and preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to countries that don't have them—on all these central issues, you and I are basically in agreement. It would be a tragedy if a split among those of us who are committed to these goals results in handing over the White House to those who oppose these directly. I know what I'm talking about, because here in Oregon in 1976 the Gene McCarthy candidacy got 40,000 votes, and as a result the Republicans won this State by just 1,700 votes. So, tonight I appeal to all those who support Mr. Anderson: Consider the consequences of a Ronald Reagan Republican victory. Vote for Fritz Mondale and me not just for his sake and mine, but for your own sake and for the sake of the goals and ideals that you and I share."", ""You might say that one person can't make a difference. Let me cast my vote as a protest or let me just relax because I'm sure other people will vote. It's been good of all of you to come out here tonight-late at night, yes. You may have been involved in other Democratic campaigns in the past. You may have even contributed money so those campaigns could be financed, through advertisement and through other efforts. But remember 1948 when just a few Democratic votes made a difference, and Harry Truman was reelected President. And think about 1960, when if 28,000 people in Texas had changed their vote and a few thousand in Illinois had not voted at all, John Kennedy would never have been elected President, and Lyndon Baines Johnson, and the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act that changed the social consciousness of this Nation might never have been recorded in history. Those stories ended well, but think also about 1968 when perhaps some of you did not support Hubert Humphrey, and we sat back and didn't give our full commitment to a man who would have been a great President of this Nation, and the last time this Nation elected a Republican President would never have happened. Richard Nixon would never have been President and disgraced our country in the Oval Office."", 'Think on those things. Think on those things.', ""I know tonight as you leave this place it's important for you to do everything you can to affect the outcome of this election. Don't just vote yourselves. There's no one here that can't get on the telephone tomorrow and call fifty or maybe a hundred people to urge them to go and vote, along with you, to support the principles and the ideals that have made our Democratic Party and made our Nation great. Let's remember what's happened in past elections as we approach the election tomorrow."", 'Let me just close my remarks by quoting another Democrat, an idealist, yes, a courageous young man, yes, a young man who was killed the last day he campaigned, who might have been President himself, Senator Robert Kennedy. This is what he said to a group of supporters in Los Angeles just before he died, and this will be the last thing I say to you. These are his words. ""I ask you to recognize,"" he said, ""the hard and the difficult road to a better America. I ask you to vote for yourselves. The people must decide this election. For your sake and for the sake of your children, vote. Vote for yourselves.""', ""Thank you very much. I'm depending on you. Thank you very much. Work hard between now and tomorrow night. I need you. I need you. Let's win together.""]"
93,Jimmy Carter ,"November 03, 1980","['THE PRESIDENT. How many of you believe we\'re going to whip the Republicans tomorrow? [Applause] Right. You don\'t know what it does to a man who\'s been campaigning since early this morning—I got up at 5 o\'clock Washington time. When I asked Jody Powell, ""Where do we spend the night?"" he said, ""Governor, this evening there ain\'t no tonight."" We\'re going to leave here and fly back to Plains to vote. But I want to say that I thank you all for coming out. I love all of you. It\'s great to be here with so many Democrats, and particularly a man who has fought all his life—and still has a long time to fight—for all Americans, throughout all his career, and knows how to get things done for the United States of America and for the State of Washington, Warren G. Magnuson.', ""And I want to mention another man, too. In 1972 as the Governor of Georgia, I had one of the greatest honors of my life at the Democratic National Convention in Miami to nominate a man for President, a man who's done more in public life to keep our Nation strong and secure and at peace than anyone I know, Senator Scoop Jackson, my friend."", 'And I want to mention, too, your next Governor and my friend Jim McDermott. The only thing wrong with Jim McDermott is I have trouble with that first name. It kind of slips my mind on occasion. But I would like to say that all the Jims and all the Jimmys and all the Teds this year are working for a great Democratic victory tomorrow with your help.', ""You're blessed in this State with a fine Democratic delegation who will all be on the ticket tomorrow—Alan Swift, Don Bonker, Norman Dicks, Mike Lowry. This is a State, as you know, with a great future. You're the home of Boeing, the largest exporting corporation in America. You can really be proud of that. And your port is the closest one to China. It may be that you haven't yet realized the tremendous change that will take place in the life of all those in Oregon, Washington, California, and particularly throughout our Nation, when we see what will occur with the wonderful trade with China."", ""The normalization of relations with that great country has already meant that China is the number one buyer of American cotton. And lately we've signed a trade agreement between 6 and 9 million tons of American grain that will be shipped to China every year for the next 5 years, enough grain for 15 loaves of bread for every one of the 1 billion people who live in China. You've indeed got a wonderful future if you keep this wonderful Democratic ticket in office, and that includes me as well as the men behind me."", ""All of us are now working on the northwest fisheries bill to stock your salmon fisheries. In the past, one of the most important bills ever introduced for the fisheries industry, the American Fisheries Promotion Act, which will strengthen your industry and give our American fishermen greater rights within the 200-mile fishing zone than foreign fishermen have. We're going to pass that bill if I'm reelected, Maggie's reelected, the congressional delegation is sent back to Washington to represent you."", ""I've come here to the State of Washington many times in the last 4 years. As a matter of fact, I've been here twice as much since I've been in office as President as any previous President has ever been to see you—more than any Presidential candidate. It's because I love the State of Washington and because I've been so eager to work with you when you've made great progress or when you've faced great potential difficulties. I came here when Mt. St. Helens erupted and traveled that area with Warren Magnuson, went back to Washington, worked with him and your delegation, to make sure that we took care of this tremendous trial for the people of the State of Washington. And I'm very important to you in coming here as a candidate, because I represent, I believe, the image and the commitment and the ideals of the party down through the last half century that has meant so much to the lives of you and your families and those you love."", ""It's not a coincidence that I've come here on the last stop of my long campaign trail. I leave here tonight in a few minutes and fly back to Plains, Georgia. I'll arrive there just in time to vote in the morning, visit my mother who's in the hospital-she'll be out tomorrow—then we'll go back to Washington to listen to the returns. I've crossed a half a continent to be with you."", ""Let me tell you this in the utmost seriousness. The Republicans cannot beat us. There are not enough Republicans in this Nation to win an election. But the Democrats can beat ourselves. A low turnout by the working families of this Nation, a low turnout by the elderly citizens of this Nation, a low turnout by the teachers and students of this Nation, a low turnout by those who've been disabled and have been given a better life by the Democratic Party, a low turnout by those who share the ideals that have made you and me, together, partners in this election—those are the very things that can hurt us and put a Republican in the White House for the next 4 years. And after we wake up, Wednesday morning, and find that we've got a rightwing Republican leading this country, it's too late for us to decide we should have worked harder. You've been listening to this campaign for the last-more than a year, and you've heard the Republican candidate wrap himself in the mantle of the Democratic Party. It's not an accident. It happens every 4 years. It's happened that way all my life."", 'Have you ever heard a Republican candidate for President quote a Republican President?', 'AUDIENCE. No!', ""THE PRESIDENT. And you never will. You never will. Republicans campaign the last few months as Democrats, but once they get in office, they govern like Republicans. And after 4 years of incumbency, a Republican President has not left anything to be remembered favorably and he's not said anything to be quoted in the future. Now, some of you watched the Republican convention. You heard Ronald Reagan quoting Franklin D. Roosevelt. It would have been inconceivable for Ronald Reagan to quote Herbert Hoover or Richard Nixon, right?"", 'AUDIENCE. Right!', ""THE PRESIDENT. It's important for the people of Washington to think very seriously about the consequences of this election and the differences between us. No man who says that the New Deal was based on fascism has a right to quote Franklin D. Roosevelt. No man who opposes the minimum wage has a right to quote Harry Truman. And no man who opposed the limited test ban agreement, SALT I, the Vladivostok agreement, the antiballistic missile treaty, has the right to quote John Fitzgerald Kennedy. And no man who campaigned around this country as a full-time employee of the anti-Medicare lobby, calling that legislation socialism, has the right to quote Lyndon Baines Johnson."", ""Now, you can rewrite the lines in a movie script. You can change the advertising posture of a major corporation, but in the last 3 months of a campaign, you cannot change the lifetime commitment of a man dedicated to the most reactionary element of the Republican Party. Think in your own lives what has happened to you under Democrats. Think how they change just before an election. We recognize it now because we see it in person, but it's been that way for a long time. Let me read you what John Kennedy said about the Republicans in the campaign of 1960."", 'He said, ""They\'re even beginning to say a few kind words about Franklin Roosevelt. Twenty years from now they might even speak a good word for Harry Truman. But I guarantee you that Harry Truman will not say a good word about Republicans."" As you know, that prediction has come true, and now tonight I\'d like to make a new prediction to you. I predict that 20 years from now Republican candidates for President will even be saying good things about Jimmy Carter\'s second term.', ""I'm proud to be a Democrat because I believe in the heritage and the mission of the Democratic Party. It's changed my life. It's changed the life of my mother. It changed the life of my father. The Democratic Party's given my children a better chance for a better life. I believe in the heritage and the mission of Franklin D. Roosevelt. I believe in the heritage and the mission of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. I believe in the heritage and mission of Harry Truman. And I believe in the heritage and the mission of Lyndon Baines Johnson. And I believe also in the heritage and the mission of Hubert Humphrey. Every great advance, every single great advance in our Nation, in the private lives of our citizens, for the last half century, from collective bargaining to the minimum wage, from social security to Medicare—every single one of them has been made possible by Democrats, over the opposition of Republicans."", ""Ever since Franklin Roosevelt the pattern has been the same. Collective bargaining—Democrats supported it; Republicans opposed it. Social security—Democrats supported it; Republicans opposed it. Ronald Reagan said four times that social security should be voluntary, which would destroy it. In the debate last week he said that for a young person, social security was a bad investment. The minimum wage—Democrats supported it; Republicans opposed it. Ronald Reagan has suggested this year, proposed, that the minimum wage be repealed. Civil rights—the Democrats supported the Voting Rights bill, the Civil Rights Act. Ronald Reagan said it was bad legislation. Medicare—Democrats supported it; Republicans opposed it. I've described Ronald Reagan's support for the opposition, calling it socialized medicine. National health insurance, other moves in the future-Democrats support it; Republicans oppose it. Ronald Reagan says there will be no national health insurance if he becomes President."", ""We believe also in a strong defense. I'm a southerner. I'm a graduate of the Naval Academy, a submarine officer. I used to come to Seattle and tie up at your pier on my first submarine. When I got into the Oval Office, in 7 of the last 8 years under Republican administrations, we had had an actual reduction in the commitment of our Nation's budget funds for defense, a 37-percent reduction over a period of 8 years. Since then, with the help of Scoop Jackson, Warren Magnuson, and others, we've had a steady, planned increase in commitment, above and beyond inflation, for a strong defense. That's why our Nation has been strong. That's why we've been influential. And that's why tonight I can stand here and, for the first time in 50 years, make a statement that no other President has been able to make, and that is, for the last 4 years, since I have been in office, our Nation has not been at war, we have been at peace. And with your help—with your help we will keep this Nation strong and at peace."", ""I'm a father and I'm a grandfather and I know the tremendous power available at the fingertips of an American President. But as President, I'll always remember that the best weapon is one that's never fired in battle and the best soldier is one that never has to shed his blood or give his life in war."", ""All Presidents, Democratic and Republican, have had to face troubled times. There's never been a day since I've been in that office that there hasn't been a crisis somewhere in the world, armed conflict between other nations. I have had to make the judgment in each instance-what is the interest of my country? How can I protect those interests? How can I protect the honor of my Nation? How can protect our commitment to our allies? What is the degree of involvement? Can I resolve this problem diplomatically, politically, through persuasion, through the exercise of strength, without war? Those are the judgments that a President must make. If I handle those kinds of crises properly, with sound judgment, a sure strength, self-confidence, moderation, recognizing the ideals and commitments of the American people, then quite often you never know about the crisis that I faced for you. But if a President makes a misjudgment, any one of those crises can affect your life or perhaps the life of every person who lives on Earth."", 'I\'m very much aware of the fact that the greatest commitment that I have is to prevent nuclear war. We must continue our progress in the careful, balanced, verifiable control of nuclear arms. This is the greatest overriding issue of this campaign. Governor Reagan has said—when asked about nuclear weapons or nuclear bombs for Pakistan, Iraq, Libya, his reply was, ""That\'s none of our business.""', ""It's very important that every American consider the consequences of that election. The election of 1980 is an election not just between two men, not just between two parties, but between two futures."", ""Let me talk very briefly in closing about the future that you and I together can have. In the next 4 years, we can build a nation at peace, peace not just for 4 years, but a nation with a commitment to peace so deep and a foundation so strong it'll last the rest of this century or beyond; a nation secure, secure in our military defense, yes, also secure in our energy needs; a nation of new technology, new tools, new factories, new industries that many of us have never even dreamed; a nation of new energy sources where American coal and American fuel derived from growing crops and from the Sun replace OPEC oil; a nation that stands for human rights and decency and self-respect for individual human beings, not just here but around the world."", ""These goals are not just dreams. They can and they must be our real agenda. As long as I'm President, working with you, that will be my commitment. But I need your help in a sacrificial way. With the election just hours away, it's now clearer than ever that the winner tomorrow will be either Governor Reagan or myself."", ""Tonight, I want to say a word directly to the Washingtonians who have been considering a vote for Congressman John Anderson. On many of the key issues, like energy conservation, equal rights for women, protecting our air and water, a better life for working people, the overriding issue of nuclear arms control, preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to radical and other countries—on all these central issues, the young people, primarily, and others who support John Anderson, agree with me. But it would be a tragedy if a split among those of us committed to these goals results in handing over the White House to those who oppose all these goals. I know what I'm talking about, because in the adjacent state of Oregon last time, Gene McCarthy got 40,000 votes and Oregon went to the Republicans by 1,700."", 'Consider the consequences of a Republican victory. Think about it deeply. You might say, ""Well, one vote can\'t make a difference."" Or you might say, ""I\'ve come here tonight in the middle of the night. I\'ve done enough for the Democratic Party because I\'m going to go tomorrow and vote for the entire Democratic ticket."" You might have even helped with the campaign or made a financial contribution. I tell you that\'s not enough, because the issue of this election is so close nationwide that what you do personally might be the difference between victory and defeat. It might be the difference between a good life for you and those you love and a challenge to the things in which you believe so deeply.', ""The other night I was in St. Louis talking about and listening to the people respond about Harry Truman. Remember the election in '48. If a few people had changed their votes, then Harry Truman would never have been reelected. Think about 1960 when John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were on our ticket. If 28,000 people in Texas had changed their vote and just a few thousand in Illinois had not voted, John Kennedy would never have served this Nation as President, Lyndon Johnson likely would never have been elected President; the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, the great changes that have taken place for the betterment of your lives, might never have occurred."", 'Both those stories had a good ending, but think about another election in 1968 when the Democratic Party was divided. Some of the Gene McCarthy voters said, ""Hubert Humphrey hasn\'t measured up to our 100-percent standard,"" and they didn\'t give him the support. A great man, a heart full of love, a great idealist, a great Democrat, never had a chance to serve this Nation as President. And what happened? The last Republican that this country has elected, Richard Nixon, was elected President, disgraced the White House, because Democrats, not Republicans, determined the outcome of that election.', 'So tomorrow, the issue\'s in your hands. Let\'s remember these events that I\'ve just outlined to you. There\'s not a single person listening to my voice that can\'t contact at least 50 or 100 people between now and the time the polls close tomorrow. Let\'s remember in closing, the words of another Democrat—and this is the last thing I\'ll say to you. This is a Democrat who died in the midst of a campaign. He was a good, idealistic Democrat, never had a chance to serve as President. I don\'t know if he\'d have been elected or not. His name was Robert Kennedy. This is what he said to his supporters in Los Angeles. He said, ""I ask you to recognize the hard and difficult road to a better America. I ask you to vote for yourselves.

And I thanked all of you for having helped me be elected to the highest office available in the free world."", ""I've had now a chance to serve for 4 years the greatest nation on Earth and the greatest people in the world. We've made some very difficult decisions, and every time I've made a judgment in a time of crisis or a time of solitude about the future of our country or the future of your lives, I've done it with the memory of my upbringing here in Plains, the fact that I'm a southerner, the fact that I'm an American. I've offered my life, as many of you have done, in time of war, to preserve freedom and to preserve the things in which we all believe."", ""We've made some difficult decisions. Some of them have not been politically popular. Some of them have been highly publicized. Some of the crises with which I've dealt you've never known about them, because they didn't develop into something that affected your life or the lives of people around the world. We've tried to deal fairly with all people, with black people, with those who speak Spanish, with women, for those who've been deprived in life. We've done this in every instance. Sometimes it's aroused the displeasure of others, and sometimes it's been politically costly."", ""Some of the most difficult decisions that have ever been made by the Congress or a President have been made in the last 4 years. We've been afflicted with the shock of more than a doubling in the price of oil in 1979, but our country was ready for it. Our people responded well. We've had unbelievable inflation the early part of this year. It's begun to come down, because you've responded. And we're now importing, as you know, 2 million barrels of oil a day less than we did just a year ago. We've cut it 30 percent in less than 12 months, because of you, not because of me. It was difficult for the Congress to take this action, but they did it, and they aroused the animosity of some who thought we moved too fast, didn't move fast enough."", ""The Panama Canal treaty was one of the things that I think is a courageous judgment that we've made. We acted in a way that was fair and decent. We did away with the colonial atmosphere of our country. We've formed a partnership with Panama. Now we share with them the responsibility for opening that canal, keeping it operating properly. After the year 2000 we'll still have a full right to defend it. This was a decision not easy to make, perhaps one of the most difficult judgments that an individual United States Senator has ever had to make."", ""We've kept our Nation strong, kept our Nation at peace. Sometimes it has not been easy to make a judgment in times of crisis overseas, but I can say to you something that no President has been able to say for the last 50 years. Our Nation has not been at war. We've been at peace."", ""And as you well know, the economic news has not always been good. I've noticed that we've had drought here in Georgia. We've had very difficult increases in energy prices. We've tried to handle these issues as you would have me handle them. In balance, our Nation has made good progress. We've honored the principles that are important to my life and yours. I think we've enhanced the freedom of people around the world. We've kept high the banner of human rights. We've not only kept our Nation at peace, we've extended peace to the people who live in the Middle East, with the exercise of the proper influence of our great country."", ""We've opened up government to people that in the past have been excluded. I've appointed more black judges, for instance, than all the other Presidents combined in 200 years—twice as many, as a matter of fact—more women judges than all the Presidents in 200 years put together; more judges that speak Spanish than all the Presidents combined in 200 years. This has not hurt our country. It's let those people, formerly deprived, formerly having been suffering from discrimination, be part of the decisionmaking process of our country."", ""Today is a great day in the life of a democracy. It's when the President and all of his challengers can cast a vote that counts the same as yours, and it's a time when you'll make a judgment about the Nation's future.

My belief is that I'll be reelected. I'll do the best I can to serve you. And I'm grateful from the bottom of my heart for the confidence that you've had in me."", ""Many people from Plains, from Americus, from Richland, from Preston, from Schley County, from around this area, have gone all over the Nation to speak for me and shake hands with people in other States, to tell them that you have confidence in me and that I would not disappoint them if I became President.
