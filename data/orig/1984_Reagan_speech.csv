0,Ronald Reagan ,"October 27, 1981","['The President. I have on other occasions spoken a line that I\'m going to speak again, but I\'ve never meant it more than I do now: ""That is a hard act to follow."" [Laughter]', ""Governor Dalton, Governor Godwin, Senator Warner, Congressman Bliley, Nathan Miller, Wyatt Durrette, the lovely wives of these gentlemen who are up here, Helen Obenshain, our good Virginia friends, the, man who brought us here tonight, of course, and his wife, Marshall Coleman-Governor Coleman, if the people of Virginia do what I think they're going to do:"", ""You know, I have a warm feeling about Virginia, and I feel like I'm among old friends tonight.Audience. You are! [Applause]"", ""The President. Thank you. I've discovered that somehow living in Washington leads to an emotional attachment to Virginia.Audience. We love you."", 'The President. Thank you. I can run down to Quantico and ride horseback through your beautiful countryside. And why not? After all, according to what I read, I only work 2 or 3 hours a day. [Laughter]', 'Of course, I\'ve had some experiences. Some years ago in World War II, I was a reserve officer in the Cavalry, and I was called to active duty. And I found myself assigned to Colonel Phillip Booker, 34 years Regular Army, Virginia Military Institute. A little later in the day, he passed by and says, ""Reagan, Mrs. Booker and I\'d be delighted to have you for dinner tonight."" And I\'ll confess that I thought, ""Oh, oh, this isn\'t bad."" I was seared to death, a second \'lieuie"" first time out, and I thought, ""but here maybe Hollywood has had some effect or something.""', 'I didn\'t realize at the time that he\'d had a bad experience when he first was assigned to active duty, and from that time on had always invited to dinner, on the first day, a new officer assigned to his command. But that night, in the company of a couple of admirals and a general or two, and their wives, and after a cocktail or two, there was a moment of silence. And I said, ""Colonel Booker, I think you and I have something in common."" And he says, ""What\'s that, Reagan?"" And I said, ""Well, you\'re a graduate of Virginia Military Institute, and I was in a picture once called \'Brother Rat.\'"" [Laughter] And he said, ""Yes, Reagan, I saw that picture. Nothing ever made me so mad in my life."" [Laughter]', ""But seriously, there's much more about Virginia. It stands, as you have been told already tonight, as a hallmark of sound, responsible government. And this was demonstrated by your support during the recent budget and the tax battles. In keeping with Virginia's fine tradition of fiscal integrity, our program received the unanimous backing of your congressional delegation and of both of your fine Senators."", 'With the urging of Governor Dalton and Marshall Coleman, Virginia put itself on the line to get Federal spending and taxes under control, and your Commonwealth has been, as Governor Godwin told you, a shining example of the meaning of federalism-a testament to the principles of conservatism that provide opportunities, jobs, and hope for all citizens.', ""When I'm talking to Virginians, I say again, I know I'm talking to friends. We have much to be thankful for in America. The most precious gift we have is our political freedom—the legacy left us by Virginians like Jefferson, Madison, and Patrick Henry. But all of Virginia's great leaders are not found in past history. In the last two decades, you've been blessed with dynamic leadership that well represented the conservative convictions of the men and women of this Commonwealth."", ""Virginia's leaders, proud and independent, provided you with progress while maintaining your traditions and heritage. Seven days from now, you and your fellow Virginians will chart the future of this State. You will determine more than just who will be Virginia's next Governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general, you'll reflect Virginia's commitment to preserving the tried and true concepts of shared power between the Federal and State governments."", ""Now, I believe that's one of the most important things that we're attempting in our economic program and all the other things in Washington. You will choose between time-honored beliefs, and an uncharted course of conduct which has led us far from the concept of sovereign states assembled together in a federation without losing their sovereignty."", ""Now, it would be inappropriate for me to tell the people of this State for whom they should vote, so I won't. [Laughter] However, since I just happen to be passing through town— [laughter] —I thought I might say a few words about a man who's been a strong supporter of our economic program, a man whom I tremendously respect—a fellow by the name of Marshall Coleman. He certainly is qualified to be the Governor of Virginia. His roots run deep. He has the depth and background necessary to do what needs to be done to keep this State on an even keel. And as the election draws near, people should carefully examine the records of the two candidates, examine them as they were pointed out to you just a few moments ago. And I hope they would do so free of the glare of advertising, in quiet reflection, ignoring the image-building that has characterized this campaign. And if they do, then Marshall Coleman will be the next Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia."", ""You know, as an ex-Democrat myself, I never cease to be amazed at how conservative liberals can sound during election years. Well, Marshall Coleman not only sounds conservative, he is conservative in the finest meaning of that word. He understands how to deal with crime and how to keep budgets under control. He's got the experience and the qualifications to do the job. I'm looking forward to working closely with him once he's elected Governor of the State of Virginia, just as I have with Governor John Dalton."", ""It isn't going to do us any good to clean up the mess in Washington unless the right kind of public officials are elected at the State level, and not just our gubernatorial candidates. We need the right kind of people in the legislature. And don't send Marshall Coleman to the Capitol alone, he's going to need Nathan Miller and Wyatt Durette. He's going to need them to ensure that Virginia keeps moving in the right direction."", ""These men are committed to the principles in which we believe; they're conservative, independent, qualified for the jobs they seek, and willing to work hard once they're elected. They're the kind of public officials I'm counting on to make our economic program work. It'll only work if we have people in State government who believe in federalism, who believe as the Constitution says that certain powers are reserved to the States and the people, and not to an all-powerful central government."", ""I appreciate this chance to talk with you because nothing would make me happier than to know when I call the Governor of Virginia, I'm going to get someone on the line who believes that we should restore the tenth amendment of the Constitution."", ""Your election next week is important to Virginia's future and to the Nation. I'm going to talk a little of my own shop for a minute here."", ""I'm sure many of you are aware that there's a vote tomorrow in the United States Senate concerning the sale of radar planes to Saudi Arabia. I'm deeply concerned about this—not about whether or not the Saudis will actually get radar planes; they'll get such aircraft, whether we provide them or not—what concerns me is how a rejection by the Senate will affect peace in the Middle East and what it will do to our ability to provide the leadership so necessary for the security of our Nation and the free world."", ""We need the good will of the Saudis. They provide us with a significant amount of our oil, yes, but more than that they represent a moderate force in the Middle East. A rejection tomorrow, I'm afraid, will be a step toward closing them out of any peace initiative, and that's why I've suggested that tomorrow's vote is as important to the ultimate security of Israel as it is to our own interest."", 'I would never risk the security of Israel. And that security depends on a stable peace in that troubled part of the world. And peace can only come by drawing the moderate Arab nations into the peacemaking process, along with Egypt and Israel, who are already hard at work at that.', 'Your Senators know this. Bless them both. And they know what this vote will do to our ability to provide leadership not only in the Middle East but in the rest of the world.', ""Now, this is a vote that's vital—vital to the West, vital to America, vital to Israel and the cause of peace in the Middle East. But tonight—I just had to talk a little shop for a minute—tonight let's get concerned about the vote Virginians are going to cast on November 3d."", ""You have 7 more days. Don't let down. Buttonhole your friends and neighbors, yes, and a few strangers. I agree with everything that's been said here about postcard registration. That isn't our problem with people not turning out to vote. The reason that we've declined year after year in the number of people going to the polls is because the Federal Government year after year has usurped so much power and authority that government seemed farther and farther away from the people."", ""When you buttonhole those people to make sure they get to the polls, remind them of the new course that's being charted for this Nation and how important it is to have Virginia involved in this crusade to restore fiscal responsibility to government, freedom to the individual, and autonomy to the Commonwealth of Virginia-the autonomy authorized by the Constitution, which for too many decades has been usurped by Washington."", 'Spend these 7 days making sure that Marshall Coleman will be the next Governor of Virginia and give him the team to do what has to be done.', ""You know, it's been a wonderful experience, this battle that's been going on in Washington the last few months. First of all, there was putting up with the shock of those who found out that you were going to try to do what you said you were going to try to do. [Laughter] Sometimes you felt like you had to wave your hand in front of their glazed eyes to get their attention. But the biggest miracle has been hearing from the people. Oh, yes, the people like yourselves—the floods of telephone calls when we mentioned it on television, the mail, the wires, the things that told our elected representatives what you, the people, wanted them to do."", 'But other calls that were so thrilling and so exciting:', ""—To get a call from a union worker before Solidarity Day in Washington, to tell me that he not only wasn't going to go but to show me or send to me a copy of the letter that he had sent to the head of his union explaining why the union shouldn't go and why they should be in support of what we were trying to do. The courage of a man to do that and stick his neck out that far."", '—But then to get a letter from a 16-yearold boy who said, ""From what\'s going on there, I\'m sure that you\'re going to save the country for kids like me.""', '—To get a letter from an enlisted man on a submarine that says he knows he\'s speaking for his 180 shipmates, and he wound up saying, ""We may not have the biggest navy in the world anymore; we\'ve got the best.""', '—To get letters like the letter from a lady down in New Orleans who told me that she was black, told me her age—and I won\'t reveal it here, but she was very elderly-and then to tell me, ""Thanks for destroying the war on poverty."" She said, ""Maybe now, we at last can get back to growing our own muscles and taking care of ourselves the way we should.""', '—To get a letter from a lady in Illinois who told me that she was one of three CETA employees at the time when we were changing that program. And she said, ""I just want you to know I only have-really, there\'s only enough work for one of us. We don\'t need three."" She said, ""As we came to the end of last year, the last fiscal year, there was money left over."" She said, ""I was ordered to go out and buy new office furniture because we couldn\'t have any money left over or the grant might be reduced for the coming year."" So, she said, ""Here I sit at my great new executive desk with nothing to do."" And I thought that was too much. I happened to have been born in Illinois myself. So, I called in some of our people, and I read them that letter. And I said, ""I think she deserves better than what she\'s got."" And you know something? She is now employed in a $25,000 a year job out in the private sector and happy with her work.', ""She says it beats daytime television- [laughter] —which gets me to the final thing that I just want to mention here that's part of all of this and part of why we need these gentlemen who are on the platform and need them in your State Capitol; and that is, I have believed for a long time that the history of America is based on voluntarism, that we have done good works."", ""I remember when I was a young man and the great earthquake virtually destroyed the cities of Japan—and America came to the rescue. It wasn't a government program or foreign aid. The people of America mobilized, and a national chairman was appointed by the President, and the people raised the money and went to the rescue. And it was true with the famines in India, it was true with the floods and the storms here in our own country. The first act wasn't to declare something a state of emergency. The first act was people in the rest of the area or around got together and created funds to send help to their neighbors, even though they didn't know those neighbors that lived in some other part of the country."", ""Well, the biggest thrill I'm getting today is, as we have set out and appointed a national committee to encourage voluntarism, the letters I am getting from communities, from organizations, from people all over this country that are already engaged in such programs. Do you know that in five States, there is a program where with private enterprise, they go in with volunteers to the high schools and they seek out the high school students who are about to graduate who are the least likely to succeed. They don't look for the prizes; they look for the ones who will have the least chance of getting a job. And in those five States they have had a tremendous success in putting those young people into jobs. The young people stay in the jobs and progress in the jobs, and before that, their high school graduates averaged 2 years out of high school before they went on welfare."", 'This, all being done by Americans like yourselves who still have faith in their neighbors and faith in this system and faith in freedom. And I am so excited and thrilled by what I\'m seeing of America that says, ""You bet. Just point to what you want solved, we\'ll do the rest.""', ""So, we're going to get along just fine, and you're going to get along just fine, and I'm going to get along just fine with Governor Marshall Coleman. Thank you very much.""]"
1,Ronald Reagan ,"February 08, 1982","[""Governor, Senator Durenberger, and Penny, our Congressmen who are here-Tom Hagedorn, Bill Frenzel, Vin Weber, and Arian Stangeland—and an old friend who is right down here in front, known to all of us. Why don't you stand up here? I know they would all recognize you when you do. Harold Stassen. I thank all of you for that Paul Bunyan welcome."", ""I don't know, perhaps it's Paul Bunyan's influence that causes so many tall tales to be told in Minnesota. Dave Durenberger tried to tell me that it's been so cold that the walleyes jumped on the hooks just to get out of the water. [Laughter] Now, I didn't believe that. [Laughter] Then he tried to tell me it's been so cold that the Minnesota State bird is now a penguin. [Laughter] And I didn't believe that. And then he tried to tell me that it's been so cold here that the only place you can keep warm is at a Durenberger campaign rally. And that I believe."", ""Dave, I was going to say something about you being a Paul Bunyan yourself, and then that connotation of maybe tall tales and everything, I don't want to take away anything from what you just previously said. [Laughter] I don't want to infer that it might not—anyway, I appreciate it."", ""But this Senator has spent at least 120 days each year traveling through this State. He spends an average of 2.5 days a week in Minnesota and still maintains a voting record in the Senate of 95 percent. We've got some that have forgotten about going home. They now live in Washington, and they don't have a voting record like that. If every public official served his State and the nation as well as Dave Durenberger, we could lick our problems in no time."", ""He's been especially helpful in our effort to reduce taxes and spending. You perhaps got that idea hearing him a few moments ago. As a member of the Finance Committee, he played a key role in such areas as a State tax reform so that family farms and businesses wouldn't have to be sold just to pay that death tax. And I can tell you, he is serving Minnesota as an independent and conscientious member."", ""Now, let me be honest and say that I may not always agree with Dave Durenberger- [laughter] —but I always listen to him. He understands the kind of people you are. In some of my speeches, I have talked about neighbor helping neighbor. And when I say such things, some of the press look at me as if I'm talking Polynesian. Well, I wish those skeptics would put aside their big city newspapers and occasionally read the weekly Kirkhoven Minnesota Banner. If they had picked up the November 12th issue, they would have seen a story about 16 farmers who helped a fellow farmer who had been seriously injured in an automobile accident. They chopped and plowed 160 acres in 6 hours to get his land in shape. They donated their time, their callouses, and their equipment. Wives and friends provided the lunch. The people of Kirkhoven exemplify the true spirit of Minnesota. And so does Dave."", 'I came to Minneapolis today just so I could tell the citizens of this State that I admire their Senator. I respect your values and your friendship.', ""And now, having said that, I'm going to talk a little bit about some of the things you've probably been hearing about back there and what's going on in Washington. In the days ahead, you're going to be submerged with demagoguery about the '83 budget, which just was sent up to the Hill to Congress today. Demagoguery—the columnist and journalist Burnham once said that when even the most skillful surgeon operates on a Democratic politician, he cannot separate demagogic from solid tissue without causing the death of the patient. [Laughter]"", ""Now, in delivering that budget message, it was not easy for a conservative like myself to say that the deficit that we're estimating for that year is going to be about $90 billion. And yet, this budget represents the lowest annual increase in spending by the Federal Government in 14 years. When we took office, spending was increasing at an annual rate of about 17 percent. In '83, this budget, as adopted, as we've submitted it, that increase will be 4.5 percent."", 'Now, you\'re hearing all kinds of horror stories about the people that are going to be thrown out in the snow to hunger and die of cold and so forth. Let me just talk a little about this. Maybe the biggest mistake-and we\'re all guilty of it—is we\'ve used the term ""cutting the budget."" We haven\'t cut a single budget. The budget in \'83 is going to be bigger than the budget this year. This year\'s budget is bigger than last year\'s as it was bigger than the one before. So, there\'s been no budget reduced beyond or below what the budgets have been before. We have been reducing the rate of increase that has been built in and that has been submitted to us for consideration in these budgets. Seventeen to fourteen—[ applause].—', 'The safety net—for those who must depend on the rest of us, like that injured farmer—is still there. The outlays for the elderly in 1983 will be double what they were as recently as 1978. The income assistance to the needy, not counting social security, which was $47 billion in 1980, will be more than $60 billion in the new budget.', ""Our opponents have said that the only thing we must now do—they're horrified by the thought of a deficit, and so, therefore, they say that we must increase the taxes. Forget this business of the tax cuts that we've put into effect and that we must do this, because we must not have that unbalanced budget. We've only balanced one budget in the last 20 years, and their Congress has been in charge almost uninterrupted in both Houses of the Legislature for the last 40 years. And we have known budgets consistently."", ""I remember when Lyndon Johnson told us that he didn't want to break the hundred-billion mark—my, the good old days, the deficit was under a hundred billion dollars—didn't want to break that, so he submitted a budget that he said he had—lean and hard, and he had it down to $98 billion. And no one spoke up and reminded us at the end of the year that that $98 billion budget had ended up costing $137 billion."", 'In the last 6 months of 1980, the election months, when people were campaigning, the money supply suddenly increased by the highest rate in our history—13 percent. That was to stimulate the economy, because in 1979, what we now have, a recession, had begun to start. That—didn\'t need that. That was a redundancy—""begun to start."" [Laughter] Well, it had.', 'With that great increase in the money supply, the interest rates went to 21.5 percent. Inflation went to the neighborhood of 14 percent. We knew in, just a couple of years before, the only time in the history of this country when we had double-digit inflation in 2 years, back to back, and followed each other. The unemployment-there were about 8 million unemployed in this country. And already there were spots in which you had to say ""depression.""', ""When we took office, there were places like Flint, Michigan, where the unemployment rate was 20 percent, other communities, almost as bad, but it was spotty. So, they didn't see it as being like the worldwide and the nationwide depression that we'd had in the great thirties. But in that year of '80, we had increased the taxes—in fact, in the 5 years preceding '81, we had the biggest tax increases in our history, doubled the taxes, and, at the same time, we did all these other things, increased unemployment and increased inflation. Now, what makes them think that raising the taxes now will not do the same thing, that that is an answer, to go back to the same things that they've been doing, put the money supply on a roller coaster, going up and going down, inflation skyrocketing."", ""Well, today the interest rates are about 15 3/4—well, there was a jump in some of the bank rates up a point or so, but they're down from what they were when we started. Inflation is down. And for the first time, we're approaching single-digit inflation. And, yes, .unemployment is up because of this recession. It's the cruelest thing, I think, that can happen to people, when people who want to work and can find no work."", ""But here's why we believe that our tax program is their answer. This country in these recent years has had the lowest rate of savings of any of the great industrial nations on the part of our people because of our tax system. This country's industrial machine, which is now unable to compete with the other industrial nations, because we've had the lowest rate of investment in new machinery and plant and equipment—the average industrial plant and equipment in America is 17 years old. In Japan, it's only 10 years old."", ""Just since August when the first slight phase of our program went into effect, there has been a definite increase in the percentage of the people's earnings that is being saved. That will form the capital pool where industry and business can turn and get the money they need to expand and modernize and become once again competitive. We're not being outcompeted because the American working man isn't as good as any other. We're being outcommitted, because with the best working people in the world, we haven't given them the tools they need to compete on the international scene."", ""And already, we can tell you that that $90 billion deficit of 1983 will actually be smaller in proportion to the gross national product than the deficits were in '75 to '78, when we were coming out of that '74, '75 recession. Those who opposed our plan and fought against it and, indeed, were saying that it had failed before it even started, which—the start, as I say, was last October 1st—now they're strangely quiet about those last 6 months when the increases took place in inflation and in tax rates and there were 8 million unemployed. We didn't go to the present 9 million from full employment. We were pretty well on our way there to begin with."", 'Our plan is based on the idea that government spending, the rate of increase in government spending, must be reduced until it comes down within the limit of the normal increase in our revenues that we gain from taxation.', 'The second point is that we must have an economic program of taxes—as we have now—that will stimulate and offer incentives to the economy to broaden the base of the economy so that even the government will get the revenues it needs, but from smaller assessments against each individual.', ""And the third phase of it is thousands of regulations that have been passed over the last few decades conflicting, competing regulations inflicted on local government, on State government, and on the private sector—unnecessary regulations, some you could laugh at, if they didn't hurt so much. Well, under the Vice President, we've had a task force working on those regulations. And already, as I said the other night in the State of the Union address, there are now 23,000 fewer pages in the Federal Record [Federal Register], which lists the Federal regulations, than there were when we started a year ago. And we're going to do more."", ""And we have a task force at work also on fraud and waste and extravagance in government. When people say that our programs, if we're reducing the amount of money, with the increase needed for some of the social programs, we're trying to get at the people who were never intended to participate in those programs in the first place, but who, through the conflicting Federal regulations and loopholes, legally or technically are participating, and there is no real need for them to be helped at the expense of their neighbors. This is what we're trying to do and to change."", ""To give you an example of how much out there is to be found and how much we're counting on in the coming year, our task force just with one foray—not a nationwide investigation of this as yet—has found that in one program, 8,500 recipients of benefits are still receiving those benefits, and they have been dead an average of 7 years. That's why the other part of our program, which you can call the fourth point I proposed the other night, which is the federalism program to get government in at least 40-odd programs back into the hands of local and State governments where it can be run properly by people closest to the scene and not mismanaged by the Federal Government."", ""I've talked longer than I intended to, but I'm just going to say one more thing. A lot of the demagoguery you will hear will be about the fact of the defense budget, and if anything has to be cut, why don't we cut that? We don't cut it because that's what's been going on for the last several years, and it will take us until the middle of the 1980's before we can even begin to come close to equating what the Soviet Union has built up to threaten us with."", ""It is absolutely necessary that we restore that capacity to defend ourselves. And when I look at these young people down here—and I'm so happy to see them here and to participate—I just want to tell you one thing. When we build up our national defenses, it isn't with the idea that some day you're going to go fight a war. The idea in building them up is that we will be so strong that no other generation of young Americans will have to bleed their lives into foreign battlefields or beachheads someplace out in the oceans."", 'I promise you one more thing—that as we build up our national defense, our national security, we will not stop or let up one minute with getting those other fellows across the table from us and now talking legitimate arms reductions.', ""Well, that's all, except to tell you, you just confirm everything that Dave and I and the others there believe. You have to get about 50 miles, at least, away from the Potomac River and the District to get back to the real world.God bless you. Thank you very much.""]"
2,Ronald Reagan ,"March 02, 1982","[""Mr. Mayor, officials and officers of your State government, Senator Simpson, Congressman Dick Cheney, my old friends Governors Hansen and Hathaway, members of the State legislature, Republican State chairman, your National Committee members, and the man that we're here to honor today and to pledge our support to, Senator Malcolm Wallop:"", ""Malcolm, I thank you very much for those very generous and kind words. Why doesn't the Washington Post write like that? [Laughter]"", ""It's not only a great pleasure to be with you this afternoon, it's something of a relief. Whoever said the worst place to get a perspective on America is Washington, D.C., was absolutely right."", 'But, you know, before I go on, I have to tell a little story here. As that plane was coming in to land and I was looking out, suddenly my memory went way back—and I mean way back. I was a sports announcer, Des Moines, Iowa, WHO. And one day I received an offer of a contract at a studio in Hollywood. And so, I packed up in an old Nash Lafayette convertible everything that I owned in the world and took off in the morning from Des Moines. And my first stop that night was Cheyenne, Wyoming.', 'I checked in at a hotel. I had dinner, and then I went to a movie. And the movie just happened to be a thing called, ""A Star is Born."" Not the remake, the first time they\'d made it. [Laughter] And those of you who might have seen it remember that it was a picture about the horrors and the vicissitudes of someone trying to get started in Hollywood. I didn\'t sleep very well that night. [Laughter] I almost turned around and went back the other way.', ""But to get back to the subject at hand. You know you don't have to spend much time in Washington to appreciate the prophetic vision of the man who designed all the streets there. They go in circles. [Laughter]"", ""I've been looking forward to coming home to the great American West. While Washington, as usual, seems paralyzed by handwringers, the people here are filled with just what Malcolm was talking about-frontier spirit. And I'm still sure that the future is ours to shape."", ""Your senior Senator, Malcolm Wallop, embodies that Wyoming courage and optimism in the United States Senate. He's working hard to restore incentive and productivity to our economy and accountability to our system of government. He sounds the Wyoming call for fiscal responsibility loud and clear in Washington. But the economic mess that we're in has been piling up for decades, and it's going to take some time to straighten out. That's why the people of Wyoming and all Americans need Malcolm Wallop's service and dedication for another term in the United States Senate."", ""I have a message for the pessimists on the Potomac: The rest of the country still believes in America and in tomorrow. Together we'll get control of this economy, strengthen our defenses, and restore health to our nation. And we'll do it by returning our economy and our government to the American people. With the help of leaders like Malcolm Wallop, Alan Simpson, and Dick Cheney, we'll guide our country out of this dark tunnel of recession and decline. But we must stick to our course—a difficult but straight road to recovery."", ""Incidentally, just a moment ago in the other room before we came in, attention was called to the fact that of all the total State delegations in the Congress in Washington, none has a higher record of support of what we've been trying to accomplish than the delegation that sits before you here today."", ""Those who would have us return to the failed policies of yesterday, offering only the equivocating and uncertain leadership that got us into this mess, would take us once again down a garden path that's laid out like the traffic circles of Washington: We would continue going around and around getting nowhere, constantly in motion yet neither coming nor going. This nation has turned away from the dizzying years of tax and spend and tax and spend. We will not go back."", ""Some of the same people who ran this country for the last 20 years—who pushed us to the brink of economic disaster—now want to steal your tax cut before you even get it. And let me point out that the so-called tax cut, historic as it is, only lessens the previous tax increase. The government is still taking in more money every year. Yet some say that raising your taxes more is the only way to balance the budget. Well, I don't think they've gotten the message yet."", ""Let's look at the record. A fellow named Al Smith used to say that. Under past leadership in Washington, our taxes went up more than 200 percent in the last 10 years, and in the last 10 years we ran up a string of gigantic deficits. We don't have a budget deficit because we don't tax enough; we have a budget deficit because we spend too much."", 'You know, the people that are complaining the loudest because now, yes, this recession which came upon us and was coming upon us for the last several years has increased what even our conservative estimates of the deficit was going to be, because every time you add 1 percent to the unemployment rolls, you add 25 to 27 billion dollars to the deficit. And yet, I don\'t recall any of them in those past years, when they were in control of both Houses of the Congress, ever protesting much about deficits. It seems to me that I remember hearing them say, ""Oh, we don\'t have to worry about the national debt. We owe it to ourselves."" And I remember them saying, ""A little inflation each year is good for us. It maintains prosperity."" Well, listening to the born-again budget-balancers moan about deficits now is kind of like hearing a mugger in Central Park complain about crime in the streets. [Laughter] I don\'t believe that I was sent to Washington to raise your taxes, and neither was the new majority in the United States Senate.', ""Others say the way to balance the budget is to cut back on defense. But the very survival of our nation requires that we go forward with the defense spending program. And one of the reasons we must go forward can be seen in these young people that I'm so happy are here today. It is not because we envision someday sacrificing them on a battlefield. We want that defense so that someday a generation of young Americans or in no future day will ever have to go and do that anyplace in the world."", ""The rate at which the Soviet Union is increasing its capabilities leaves us still a number of years before we'll even begin to close the gap. Now, this is one subject on which the man holding the job that I now hold is practically the only one who has all the facts with regard to our national security. And I tell you we dare not reduce our defense budget."", ""The bulk of our increase is not going for fancy new planes or elaborate weapons systems. Most of that money is going for basic essentials now in dangerously short supply. It's going for manpower, maintenance, and readiness. If we eliminated all the major weapons systems, all the programs that are scheduled in the present budget, it would only reduce next year's deficit by $6 1/2 billion in an economy that will be $3 trillion. I don't think Americans want their American forces held together with chewing gum and baling wire, unable to move for want of spare parts."", ""We must not resign ourselves to life as a second-rate power, tempting aggression with our weakness. America has never gone to war because it was too strong. We must rebuild our defenses and secure our freedom so that once again America will be second to none in the world. It's my duty as President, and the responsibility of us all as United States citizens, to keep this country strong enough to remain free and at peace."", ""We have submitted to the Congress a budget that will reduce deficits, rebuild our defenses, and begin to control the runaway costs of so many of our Federal programs. We're open to suggestions and alternatives from the Congress. We welcome ideas for spending even less. But as the volume of voices rises in debate, there's one thing I want to make very plain: My commitment to cutting taxes and rebuilding our defenses is every bit as strong today as it was the day I took office. There will be no retreat in those areas."", ""America today is at a turning point. For too long we've been stalled in history, repeating mistakes of yesterday because our leaders have been afraid to share a new tomorrow. But our people are ready. Our people know that they can solve any problem, that no challenge is too great. They're fed up with promises and platitudes. They're calling for the government to have faith in the governed."", 'You know, when I was in that other business, I used to say about some Hollywood producers that they didn\'t really have faith in the intelligence of the American people. Well, that can be said of many in Washington today. Faith in the American people-one of the most inspiring things that happens to me is the mail that I get. A letter from a blind veteran, World War II, lost his sight 37 years ago in Germany in combat. I had to have his letter translated from the braille. He wrote to tell me that if it would help our country to cut his pension, cut his pension—the elderly gentleman, quite elderly, who sent me his entire monthly social security check and asked that it be used to help retire the debt. And a young man—this was last year when we were still trying for the tax cuts and for our first cuts in the budget—a young man who wrote to tell me that he\'d been going to college on one of the Federal loans, college loans, and he said, ""But I\'m going lay out a year and work and earn the money to go back the next year, so that I won\'t be a burden on our country any longer.""', ""And then just yesterday a packet of letters all came in one little bundle, each letter from a little girl, and each little girl-they live in Tennessee—writing to tell me how much they love America, how beautiful America is, how much they can see the opportunities that lie before them. Every one of the little girls is a refugee from the Communist invasion of Laos. They're children of the boat people that came here for sanctuary—and now telling us how much they love this country."", ""Unshakable faith in the American people is at the heart of our program for economic recovery and our proposal to return power and resources to the levels of government closest to the people. The principle is the same. There's no one in Washington who should enjoy an open season spending your hard-earned money. And there's no one in Washington with a corner on the compassion and wisdom that it takes to run this city or this State."", ""In the last 2 weeks mayors, city councilmen, legislators, and Governors from both parties, county officials have applauded our overall proposal to strengthen the partnership between the levels of government. Americans by a 2-to-1 majority favor more power closer to home. I think it's time we listened to the millions of voices west of Washington."", ""It's time we tapped the well of human spirit that runs so deep in our land. We'll find more than the strength of numbers and the strength of resources. We'll find the strength of individual courage, know-how, and love of country."", ""I believe the American people are with us in our cause. We can't make things right overnight, but we will make them right. I'm asking you, as I'm asking all Americans in these long months of decision, to stay with us as we hold to this new path."", ""You and your forebears, as Malcolm said, tamed a wild frontier. And, believe it or not, you did it without an area redevelopment program or urban renewal. [Laughter] So now, load up the musket and help us conquer this wild growth and centralization of power which threatens all that we've created."", ""I'm counting on the advice and support of Malcolm Wallop in the months ahead and the years ahead as we return this country to our first well-charted course. Now, I'm going to say that I'm sure we probably don't agree on every issue. No two people do. But we share the overriding philosophy that individual freedom, individual integrity, and individual ingenuity made us the greatest country the world has ever known. And I know that these gentlemen you sent to Washington who are here with us, I know Malcolm and myself, we put our trust in God and in the American people."", ""I urge you, return Malcolm to the United States Senate where you and I and all Americans need him, and together we'll make America great again.Thank you very much.""]"
3,Ronald Reagan ,"March 02, 1982","[""Thank you very much for a most heartwarming welcome. You know, in Washington you wake up to the local news there, and you're not always as enthused as you are right now."", ""But, Mr. Chairman, Mayor Kinney, Republican State Chairman Morris, Mrs. Schmitt, Senator Jack Schmitt, I came to Albuquerque today to tell you something that I now realize is absolutely unnecessary to tell you, and that was how lucky you are to have a Senator like Jack Schmitt. You already know that. And you're lucky that, among other things, he's a geologist, because let me tell you, Washington has more than a few people with heads that only a rock hound can handle. [Laughter]"", ""For 6 years now Jack has been chipping away at the petrified attitudes that have characterized Washington for decades. And now this year with a Republican administration and a new Republican majority in the Senate, he's had some help."", ""As chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, he played an instrumental role in enacting last year's budget cuts. They were, incidentally, the biggest cuts that have ever been made in the history of this country. And let me say he handled those budget cuts with as much skill and precision as he flew the spacecraft that took him to the Moon. He was careful, and he did no harm to the programs that genuinely serve the needy or provided sound education value to our children."", ""You know, right now, because of some changes that we're making with regard to the Department of Education, there seems to be spreading in a kind of a wave among some people that—well, we're trying to do away with or lower educational quality. Not so. There are those in Washington who, ever since they turned to Federal aid to education, intended Federal control of education, and that interference by the Federal Government has hurt the quality of education from coast to coast in this country."", ""The Congress is now beginning to study the administration's 1983 budget proposal, and this proposal provides a solid framework for congressional consideration. You've been hearing a lot about so-called alternatives to the budget that we've presented. Well, many of these are not genuine budget alternatives at all, but political documents designed for saving certain legislators' political hides rather than saving the economy."", ""This administration is willing to consider any comprehensive program as long as it does not compromise the fundamentals of our tax cut program. The American people have been promised tax relief. Last year the Congress passed tax relief, and as long as I have any say in the matter, no one's going to take it away from us."", ""It is true that we've only had the first installment and a small one that hardly made a dent in the built-in tax increases which we had inherited. But the next installment will come in July 1st, and then there will be a further one in the following year. Incentive must be returned to those who work and save and invest."", ""And if I may echo and add to something that Senator Schmitt said up here a moment ago, there's another bottom-line requirement, we cannot afford to compromise our national defense needs. Senator Schmitt has worked for a stronger defense. He has read the studies. He knows that our relative military imbalance with the Soviets will be at its worst—in spite of our buildup, it will be at its lowest point by the mideighties. He's familiar with the horror stories of recent years—fighter planes that couldn't fly because they didn't have the spare parts, Navy ships that couldn't leave port, a Rapid Deployment Force that was neither rapid nor deployable and not much of a force. He knows that a major conflict involving the United States could occur without adequate time to upgrade United States force readiness."", ""For years, he has advocated substantial increases in the defense budget, and this administration agrees wholeheartedly. An increase is essential. Defense has been starved for years. And yet it is not true, as some charge, that we're splurging extravagantly on unnecessary defense spending while we are neglecting our other Federal responsibilities."", ""In 1962 President Kennedy's budget, to give you something to judge this by, called for defense spending that amounted to 44 percent, almost half of the national budget. Even with our increases, defense spending this year will only be 29 percent of the overall budget. That's right halfway between one-fourth and one-third of the budget."", 'Now, to those who say there must be an alternative to our increased military budget, I agree. What they say is absolutely true, there is an alternative to a larger defense budget. It is a larger and increased possibility of war.', ""These young people who are here today, there isn't any one of us who is anticipating the day or thinking in terms that they should some day be called upon to bleed their lives into some battlefield somewhere in the world as other young people have before them. No, if we have the proper defensive strength, no young Americans will have to bleed their lives into a battlefield. A cutback in defense would be a cutback in our chance of peace and security."", ""As much as I detest the idea of deficits, as President I must accept a large deficit if that is what it takes to buy peace for the rest of this century and beyond. With every improvement in our military readiness that we make today, we're saving the life of some young American who'll be serving our country tomorrow."", 'As you well know, Senator Schmitt is one of the very few men on this Earth who has walked on the Moon. It must be quite a sight up there, looking back on this beautiful blue planet hanging in the void. I would think that seeing the Earth from a quarter of a million miles away must change a man forever. He must look at everything ever after from a different perspective, a larger perspective. And I think Jack Schmitt has brought that perspective to the Senate.', ""Being a scientist, Jack has that analytical, independent mind. When the facts support our case, he'll support the administration. When the facts don't support us to Jack's satisfaction, well, he can be as stubborn as those burros the prospectors use to lead around New Mexico's mountains. [Laughter] And I mean that in the friendliest of spirits. [Laughter]"", 'You know, when I was much younger, I heard about a prospector that came down out of those mountains, and when he arrived in civilization and announced that he had been up there for 40 years hunting gold—said he\'d been there—that\'s what he was, a prospector—he\'d been up there for 40 years. And the fellow he was saying this to said, ""You mean you\'re been up there in the mountains for 40 years looking for gold?"" And he says, ""No. I was only looking for gold i year. The other 39 I was looking for my burro."" [Laughter]', 'That illustrates a certain independence there. But whether Jack agrees with us or not, he always listens—or we always listen to what he has to say, because we know that he speaks for New Mexico and her citizens and for this country.', 'I came here to deliver a message. The message is that Congress needs Jack Schmitt in the Senate. The administration-my administration needs Jack Schmitt in the Senate. And if I may be presumptuous enough to speak for you here today, New Mexico needs Jack Schmitt in the Senate.', 'Let me just say one or two more words. Jack told you about some of the figures and some of the changes that have occurred in this last year with regard to interest rates, with regard to the rate of inflation.', 'You know, it\'s sometimes easy for us to forget in Washington as we look at inflation coming down, that out here people are perhaps not so prone to notice that, because it is still inflation. So, they go to the store. They\'re not particularly interested in the rate of inflation. They only know that the price this year is higher than the price was a year ago. And all we can try to say is, yes, but it\'s not as much higher as it was getting to be a year ago. But the aim and the goal that we\'re all dedicated to in this administration and in that majority in the Senate that we have, we\'re dedicated to the day when you\'re going to go into the store and say, ""The price is lower than it was when I was in here last.""', ""We're faced with, yes, a large deficit-larger than we had anticipated because of the recession that has hit this country. How does such a figure change? Well, when you add i percent to the unemployment rate in this country, you add 25 to 27 billion dollars to the deficit, and we're in a recession. We think that we're going to turn the corner in that recession in the coming months. Things are going to be different."", ""But today, with this being an election year, there are people on the opposite side of a Jack Schmitt who are going to make a great issue about this deficit. I would ask you to remember only one thing: Remember, they are the same people who for over the last 40 years have told us the national debt isn't important; we owe it to ourselves. They are the same ones that have piled up deficits, except once in the last 25 years. They've had deficits every year but that one, and they never mentioned them, they didn't seem to be bothered too much by them. Suddenly now the deficit is the all-important issue of the coming election. Well, we hate deficits too. We hated them all of the time they were piling them up. We're going to whittle at these deficits until we're down to government spending within its means."", ""And I just finished saying to some people over in Cheyenne, we don't have deficits because of our tax cuts. We have deficits because the government is spending too much, and we're going to change that."", ""So all I ask of you—you've applauded all these things that I've said we're going to do. We'll do them a lot easier and a lot better if you send him back to Washington for another 6 years. We'd like to have him.Thank you very much.""]"
4,Ronald Reagan ,"September 17, 1982","['Millicent, thank you very much. Our Governor, your Representatives in Congress, and Millicent Fenwick, and this group here on the platform, and you ladies and gentlemen:', ""I can't match Millicent with regard to the language— [laughter] —I'11 have to stick with my own."", 'As a matter of fact, I had a little adventure once of that kind. I was invited once, while I was still Governor of California, to represent our President, then, in Mexico. And I got up and made a speech, and I knew that I wasn\'t getting much applause. As a matter of fact, I sat down to very little applause, and I was a little embarrassed. So, when the next fellow got up and started speaking to the audience in Spanish, and they were applauding—well, I beat them to it after every time. I was so embarrassed I applauded longer and louder than anybody, until our Ambassador leaned over and said to me, ""I wouldn\'t do that if I were you, he\'s interpreting your speech."" [Laughter]', 'I can\'t tell you how happy I am to be here at the San Gennaro Festival. It\'s great to get out of the White House and have some fun once in a while. [Laughter] You know, I once attended an Italian American festival where everyone was having a joyous time. There was such life and vitality and all kinds of delicious foods, just like here, and I said to the man next to me, I said, ""If anyone felt lonely, this is the place to be."" ""That\'s true,"" he said, ""no one can be lonely while eating spaghetti."" [Laughter] He said, ""It takes so much attention."" [Laughter] So, when I think of Italian families, I never think of loneliness but of warm kitchens and even warmer love.', 'I heard a story the other day about a family that lived in a little apartment, but decided to move to a big house in the country. And a friend said to the 12-year-old son, Tony, ""How do you like your new house?"" And he said, ""We love it. I have my own room. My brother has his own room. My sisters have their own rooms. But poor Mom, she\'s still in with Dad."" [Laughter] But the thing I like about Italian American families is that no matter how many rooms they have, they\'re still together. The family bond is strong and loving.', ""During the last campaign, I spoke frequently of the crucial values of family and work, neighborhood, religion, and personal freedom. And some critics claimed that it was an attempt on my part to appeal to various ethnic and religious voting blocks. Well, in a way, they were right. I happen, though, to believe in the values that so many of this nation's ethnic groups hold dear. I believe in the family; I believe in the faith that binds families together; I believe in tradition, and I don't mind sharing those beliefs one bit."", ""Perhaps some of you will remember that just a few years ago, those basic values were being forgotten at the highest levels of our government. The machinery of government even, at times, actively opposed them. Government intrusion into the life of the family and the community had reached unparalleled heights. And I don't think that government can exactly become a substitute for parents when it comes to raising a family."", ""By the time we came to Washington, Federal spending had tripled in the last 10 years. Federal taxes doubled in only the last 5 years. But somehow, all that taxing and spending and regulating wasn't making our values any stronger or our people any better off."", ""Well, with the help of New Jersey leaders like Millicent Fenwick, Representative Roukema, Congressman Jim Courter, Senator Brady, Governor Kean, and others, we've tried to turn a few things around. The growth in Federal spending has been cut nearly in half. We brought down inflation, the deadliest tax of all. It was 12.4 percent. A great many people aren't aware that today, and since January, it's only been 5.4 percent. Prime interest rates were 21 1/2 percent in 1980. They're down to 13 1/2 percent, and we want to bring them down even further, because that's still too high. Leading economic indicators, which forecast future economic activity, have been up for 4 months in a row. Now, these statistics are cold comfort, I know, to someone who's still out of work. And every night when I turn in, I don't think anything is on my mind more than the people who want jobs and can't find them. Unfortunately, unemployment is just about the last indicator that perks up after a recession, and this is the eighth recession we've had since World War II. Well, let me tell you, we're going to knock that unemployment rate down just like we're knocking down interest rates and inflation. But in the meantime, unemployment benefits for those whose payments would otherwise have run out have been extended."", ""And right now, I'm going to make a little announcement here that might come as a surprise to our Representatives and to our future Senator from New Jersey. In spite of all of our cuttings, there are things that government has to do and should do. I'm pleased to announce that the Department of Housing and Urban Development has advised me that they've agreed to approve section 8 funding for 125 units of elderly housing at Park Place, in Ewing, New Jersey. And if you don't elect her Senator, we'll take it away. [Laughter]"", 'Another threat to the family is crime. Many of you have written to me how afraid you are any more to walk the streets at night. Many older citizens are frightened to go out even during the daytime. It\'s time to get the hardened criminal off the street and ""into jail. And right now before the Congress is an omnibus anticrime package. Now in case—maybe some of the younger people here don\'t know what ""omnibus"" means. That means it\'s big. And it means that we\'re serious about fighting crime. It means we are going to give the victims the break instead of the criminal.', ""Now, I know you'd rather get back to eating, so I won't go through our entire legislative program. But what our administration is trying to do with all our legislation is protect the American family, because it's the backbone of the Nation."", ""What government must always keep in mind as it legislates and administers is the sanctity of the family, our basic social unit. If it is not sound, then our society is not sound. And the world at times may seem cold and dark, but the family is the light in the window. It guides us and offers warmth. Family, faith, and freedom are the cornerstones of American life. This festival today is a celebration of those very ideals and a celebration of America's belief. So, I thank you for allowing me to be a part of it. I know that you're going to return these Representatives to the House of Representatives. I know that you're going to send Millicent Fenwick there to be your Senator."", 'And again, I say thank you, and God bless you.']"

The vote of every citizen will matter, and every ounce of individual commitment will count. And make no mistake: The choice the American voters have this year is just as important as the one they had 2 years ago. It's a clear choice, as you've been told already, about the kind of nation that we will be—whether we will continue our sure and steady course to put America back on track, or whether we will slide backward into another economic binge like the one which left us with today's pounding national hangover."", 'Not that this campaign doesn\'t have its humorous side. You should hear some of the things that the candidates on the other side have been saying. They\'re getting more imaginative every day. You know, it won\'t be long before they will have convinced themselves that the astronomers are correct, those astronomers that believe in the ""big bang theory,"" that the whole universe and the world suddenly came into being through a big explosion, a big bang. In their version, history began with a big bang on January 21st, 1980 [January 20, 1981]. 2 [Laughter] According to them, the economic crisis emerged full-blown by spontaneous generation just a few seconds after I took the oath of office. Well, with all respect to astronomers, let\'s take a look at history. You heard some already, and it\'s all true.', '2 White House correction.', 'In the 4 years before we got to Washington, the entire Government of the United States was in the hands of those today who are the most vocal of our critics. They controlled the Presidency, the United States Senate, the House of Representatives, all the committees of the Congress, the entire executive branch, the hundreds of departments, agencies, and administrative units responsible for running the Federal Establishment-something no Republican administration has experienced for nearly 30 years.', 'When my friends on the other side began this power monopoly, America was enjoying economic stability that would be a source of envy today. Inflation was running at 4.8 percent at the end of 1976, as Gerald Ford left office. And the prime interest rate was under 7 percent. You could get a home mortgage for 9 percent.', ""But in these 4 years of Democratic monopoly-and let me point something out. When I use the term referring to the opposition party, the Democratic Party, I spent most of my life as a Democrat. I know that others in this room did, and I know there are others in this room who still are members of that party. But what has happened is a great gulf has developed between the leadership of the Democratic Party and millions of rank-and-file Democratic Party members who aren't in lockstep with that leadership.Inflation shot up to over 13 percent in 1979 to an astonishing 18 percent by January of 1980. Those in charge of the government managed to do something that had not been done in over 60 years—they gave us 2 years of back-to-back, double-digit inflation. Interest rates began their nightmarish climb. From less than 7 percent in '76, they climbed to 21 1/2 percent in 1980. Mortgages went as high as 17 1/2 percent, and homebuying came to a drastic halt."", ""These were the highest interest rates in over a century. Productivity dropped in '79 and '80, and that was the first 2-year-in-a-row drop in productivity in our recorded history. The savings rate went down. The rate of increase of industrial production dropped every year. The rate of increase in our gross national product dropped for 3 years straight. High taxes smothered the incentives of individuals and businesses. Taxpayers began paying the due bills for runaway inflation, as it kicked them relentlessly into higher income tax brackets."", 'Think of it. Your taxes actually doubled in the 5 years before we came to Washington. A Democratic President and a Democratic Congress passed the single highest peacetime increase—tax increase—in the history of the Republic. The ultimate victims, of course, were American workers and their families and the senior citizens they professed to care so much about. The grim results were that both real wages and weekly earnings decreased between 1976 and 1980. So much for liberal fairness and liberal compassion for the working people of this nation.', ""Yes, America went backwards during those 4 Democratic years. The actual standard of living went down. In many ways, they marked the culmination of decades of overindulgence by the liberal Washington establishment. Government had spun out of control like a washing machine out of balance, and the programs just grew automatically. Regulations became more complex and added untold billions in new costs. Deficits caused our national debt to bulge rapidly toward the 1 trillion-dollar mark. New departments sprang up like toadstools after a rainstorm. [Laughter] Washington increasingly swallowed up the prosperity of the entire Nation.Families were driven in the evening to the kitchen table to try and figure out-they sat around that table—how to cope with the inflation that robbed their buying power at the same time it reduced their spendable earnings. Young couples didn't dream of new homes; they dreamed of just surviving. Small businesses were hit especially hard. The only sure thing was the unstoppable fattening of the United States Government."", 'In the year before I took office, Federal spending increased by 17 percent in that single year. How many of our fellow citizens were able to say that their incomes or their pensions or their savings had gone up by 17 percent?', 'This legacy was the inevitable result of the liberal Democratic philosophy that the Federal Government could be all things to all people. The Congress had been under virtual one-party control for a quarter of a century, a spendthrift era of busted budgets and fatter and fatter government. For every new tax, there were always plenty of new ways to spend it. The Washington establishment believed that the only good dollar was the one taken out of a taxpayer\'s pocket. As a matter of fact, they began to talk about, and still talk about, the legitimate deductions that you\'re permitted by law in computing your income tax as ""tax expenditures,"" meaning that all of your money belonged to them, they only let you keep what they decided you should keep.', ""Today, right now, we're all paying the penalty of those tragic excesses.

People are saving more, and they're paying lower taxes than if we had not taken the action we did.

For 4 months in a row now the leading economic indicators have been encouraging. Confidence has soared in the stock market; it's gone up 140 points in the last 7 weeks. These are positive signals. While there may be an occasional blip, the pattern is firmly established."", ""I believe deeply that we can put this nightmarish economic calamity behind us if we have the strength to stick to our course. But until there's a job for every American who wants to work, and as long as plants and machinery lay idle, we cannot let up in our efforts.

Progress would come sloppily, but it would come steadily."", 'This has been a time of great testing, and a time when millions of Americans have displayed enormous courage and patience. The road to economic recovery is never easy, but we have made progress. Yet this election season has brought a clamor of negative voices that nothing seems to please. The cuts in spending, they say, are too deep. Taxes are too low. Their favorite special interests have been hurt. Despite all their failures of the past, they still oppose our comprehensive reform measures, and what is their alternative?', 'Well, the Congressman was right. As far as anyone can tell, their answers have mostly been recommendations to repeat their own past failures, artificially stimulate the money supply, more spending on what they call job programs, but at the same time raise taxes—in short, everything they were doing between 1977 and 1980.', ""Well, I've got news for them. Double-digit inflation is no alternative; 21 1/2-percent interest rates are no alternative; another trillion dollars of national debt is no alternative; higher taxes are no alternative."", ""To my liberal friends I say: You can't create a desert and then hand someone in the middle of that desert a cup of water and call that compassion. You can't pour billions of dollars into dead end, make-work jobs and call that opportunity. You cannot build up years and years of degrading dependence by our citizens on the government and then dare to call that hope. And believe me, you can't drive our people to despair with crises that wipe them out or taxes which sap their energies and then boast that you've given them fairness."", ""We spent in those years—that 7-year period I've talked about—we have spent $66 billion on job programs, government job programs, and during those times unemployment continued to increase, and it averaged 7 percent over those 7 years."", ""We've been down all those roads. Let's not make those same mistakes again. This time, let's do the job right."", ""We Americans have been sorely tested by these past few years of discouragement.

We will not keep on increasing it on down through the years to dump it on their backs."", ""Virginia is rich in tradition. I think everyone in America knows that and respects the traditions of this great State. You have a 50-year tradition, and certainly it crosses party lines, a tradition that for 50 years you had a Senate seat that was occupied by two Senators in succession, father and son, who were true to all of the things that we've been talking about and all of these ideals of fiscal responsibility and integrity and, yes, the spiritual revival of this country."", 'I think the best way to continue that tradition on beyond 50 years is to send Paul Trible to the United States Senate.Thank you, and God bless you.']"

Governor, Senator Paul [Laxalt], and our fine candidates who are here—Barbara Vucanovich, Chic Hecht:', ""You know those words about this clear blue sky and this fresh air, being—the West is hard to leave. So, I hope the rest of the country will forgive me if I point out: Did you ever stop to think that if Columbus had taken that boat ride across the Pacific instead of the Atlantic, the capital would be out here? [Laughter] All these good people here, except Governor List—why don't we just skip November, and I'll take them back to Washington now? [Laughter]"", 'But I\'m told that this gathering is billed as an old-fashioned GOP—Grand Old Party—rally. The only thing about that that bothers me is that word ""old-fashioned."" I have a suspicion that\'s because I\'m here. [Laughter] I\'d like to make this a pep rally for the Wolfpacks\' victory tomorrow.', 'Okay. You know, I have to tell you, I love outdoor rallies like this. Once during the campaign some fellow said to me that he didn\'t think I was working very hard. He said, ""You\'ve got too good a tan."" And I said, ""Well, I\'ve been doing a lot of outdoor rallies."" And then he says, ""Well, you talk too long then."" [Laughter] You know, there was a humorist—and maybe some of you are too young to remember him—but he was Robert Benchley. And he was in Hollywood for a time, making pictures. And when he wasn\'t working he was always indoors under a sunlamp getting a tan. And finally there in sunny California, indoors, a friend said to him one day, ""Why don\'t you just go outdoors? And Bob Benchley said, ""What? And get hit with a meteor?"" [Laughter]', ""Well, you know, there are times when I think some of our critics and our opponents must have been hit by something—meteors or something else. They've developed a very interesting case of amnesia. They can't remember a thing that was bad about the economy prior to my taking the oath of office. [Laughter] They make you think that everything economically that's bad started on January 21st, 1981. They don't remember that in the 4 years before we got to Washington, the entire Government of the United States was in their hands."", 'They controlled the Presidency, the United States Senate, the House of Representatives, and all the committees of Congress, the executive branch, the hundreds of departments and agencies responsible for running the Federal establishment. They had the whole enchilada. They controlled everything except inflation, interest rates, taxes, and an economy that was on a toboggan slide.', ""And in their political amnesia, they've forgotten that under their leadership inflation went up from 4.8 percent in 1976 to 18 percent by January of 1980, and that at the same time the interest rates climbed from 7 percent to 21 1/2 percent and our taxes doubled in 5 years. Well, I can't blame them; if I were in their place, I guess I'd try to forget a lot of things, too."", ""But now let me point out that I spent most of my life as a Democrat. And I know others at this rally have been or still are Democrats, and they have every reason to be proud of their party's many fine traditions. The problems we face today are bigger than any single political party, and solving them will require the best efforts of all our people."", ""But in saying that, let me point out something else. I think it's important to note that there is a great gulf today between millions of patriotic Democrats and the leadership of their party. I don't fault the intentions of that leadership these past years. I know they meant well. They claim compassion and deny that we feel any. But their compassion stopped short of the average American, the men and women who hold our country together and who were being taxed into poverty to support an ever-growing bureaucracy that wasn't helping solve anything. Indeed, it was not government that should solve the problems; it was government that was the problem."", ""Families, both Democrat and Republican were driven in the evening to sit around the kitchen table in too many American homes to try and figure out how to cope with inflation and what they were going to do next. And while the average family was being pinched, it was fat city for the Federal Government. In the year before I took office, that single year, Federal spending increased by 17 percent. How many of our fellow citizens were able to say that their incomes or their pensions or their savings had gone up by 14 [17] 1 percent. They hadn't. As a matter of fact, for those few years, the standard of living in this country was actually going down even though people were getting cost-of-living pay raises because those cost-of-living pay raises were moving them up into higher income tax brackets."", '1 White House correction.', ""Right now we're all paying the penalty of those tragic excesses of the past. Unfortunately, many are paying with their jobs. Nearly 11 million people are out of work. And, you know, the worst of it is, it didn't have to be this way. If only the big spenders in Congress had shown some restraint. If only they would now."", ""That's why the balanced budget is so important. The United States Congress breathes on a respirator that's pumping money, money, money. And the best way to pull the plug on its big spending ways is a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution."", ""But even though the American people want the amendment, even though a majority of the Congress voted for the amendment, the House Democratic leadership still prefers the failures of the past to the steps that we must take to build a better future. And that's what this election is all about."", ""Tomorrow the new unemployment rate comes out. And a great many people are anticipating—and very possibly it will show—another increase. But I have some questions for those who'll be all over our television screens lambasting this administration if it does. Where were they when the economy started going haywire? What are they offering now, except their failed policies of the past—spend and spend, tax and tax, and, if that isn't enough, borrow and borrow. Let me ask one final question of them: When will they open their eyes to the onrushing surge of confidence now occurring in this country's financial markets?"", ""Earlier today—you haven't heard—I'm pleased to report that a number of major banks in the United States this morning lowered their prime lending rate to 13 percent. Now, that's a far cry from the 16 1/2-percent rate that prevailed just this last summer and the 21 1/2 percent that was in effect just before we took office. And as interest rates have tumbled, investment has been flowing into our equity and our bond markets. In the past 2 months alone, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has jumped more than 20 percent. And yesterday, it had the second biggest increase in the market in history."", ""Those investors who have the responsibility of investing billions of dollars, including the pension funds of American workers, don't make their decisions lightly. Are they sending us a signal? Do they believe that the American economy is turning a corner, maybe? Do they believe we mean business in our battle against inflation? Are they ready to give this economy a strong vote of confidence?"", ""It's an unfortunate fact of life, however, that one of the last symptoms of recession to yield to a recovery is unemployment. But in the meantime, there are important steps we've taken to reduce that hardship. We've extended unemployment benefits in those hard-hit areas to those who have exhausted their time. And I will soon be signing-that's recently been passed—a job training bill, a measure that will provide training for over a million Americans a year."", ""Now, this is important. If you take on a Sunday and open to the help-wanted ads in a metropolitan paper, and discover that even with 11 million people, almost, unemployed in this country, you will find 65 or 70 pages of help-wanted ads asking for workers to come. Why aren't they filled? Because that the people who don't have the skills that those jobs require. And we're going to try to give them to them."", ""In past training bills—there's a difference between the one that I'm going to sign and those past ones. In the past bills, only 20 cents out of the dollar went to actual training. The rest could be considered administrative overhead. Well, in our bill 70 cents out of every dollar is going to the actual training."", 'And tomorrow I will sign the Export Trading Company Act, which will encourage the formation of trading companies to spur exports. And the best thing about this measure is that it assists U.S. businesses in developing exports and thus creates hundreds of thousands of jobs at virtually no cost to the taxpayer.', ""You don't know how much I wish there were some quick, easy cure for this terrible economic mess that was so long in the making. But it does seem to me that the people who created the mess are hardly justified now in claiming that having created it, they're the best qualified to try and clean it up."", ""From our very first day, we've been working to undo the economic wreckage they left behind. As a matter of fact, when I finished taking the oath of office on that inaugural day, the first thing I did was go back into the Capitol, and before I'd even taken my topcoat off, I signed an Executive order [memorandum] freezing the size of the Federal Government, that it could not grow from that day forward. To get control of the spending, to encourage incentives by lowering taxes, to root out waste and fraud, to stop unwise regulations, and start America on the road to expansion and growth once again—that's what we've been trying to do since that January day."", ""I won't dwell on this, but you might be interested to know that we've had a team of Inspectors General who have been making thousands—tens of thousands of audits. There have been thousands of indictments. There have been hundreds of convictions already for such things as a government agency spending some $300 for an item that they could get for about $30 in their local stores. Other things of—thousands of people that were still receiving checks from the Government; they'd been dead for an average of 7 years."", ""Our first priority was to lick inflation. Well, inflation has been reduced by 59 percent. Since January it's averaged 6.1 percent, and last month it went down at an annualized rate of 3.3 percent. An average family of four with an income of $15,000 is about $1,000 better off in purchasing power than it would have been if inflation had stayed where it was 20 months ago. Interest rates have dropped nearly 40 percent. And I've told you, of course, made the announcement about the prime, down to 13 now."", 'Unnecessary regulations have been reduced. The American people have been sending about 10 billion pieces of paper to Washington a year. We so far have reduced the amount of paper by about 200 million man-hours of work in filling out that paper.

But we've never been quitters, and we're not going to quit now. I hear all those voices every day saying that we can't succeed. Well, if we only put our heart and courage to the test, I say we can't fail."", ""To those who are faint hearted and unsure, I have but one message: If you're afraid of the future, then get out of the way; stand aside. The people of this country are going to move forward with people like Governor List, Barbara Vucanovich and Chic Hecht and Peggy Cavnar down south. Nevada represents the true spirit of America. And I'm honored to be with you today and to share in that spirit. And I have to tell you your hospitality has lifted my own spirits as high as those beautiful soaring Sierras that we can see out here every day."", ""I just have one last remark to make. You know, there've been great charges about who has compassion, as I mentioned earlier, and who doesn't. And, of course, we're supposed to be hard-hearted, and we're supposed to be balancing inflation by doing all sorts of cruel things."", ""Now, I know that, as I said earlier, that the party before us was well-intentioned with all of their social reforms and their attempts to help people. But when you're going to help people, you really should know what you're doing. And their efforts at helping people, that brought us a mjillion-dollar debt and brought us the inflation and made people poorer, not better off, reminded me of the young fellow one day that was riding a motorcycle."", 'It was a cold winter day, had a leather jacket on; the wind was whistling in through the buttons on his jacket chilling him. And he finally figured out if he stopped and put the jacket on backward, that wouldn\'t happen. So, he did, and down the road he went. But it kind of restricted his arm motion a little bit. So, he hit a patch of ice and skidded into a tree. And when the police arrived and elbowed their way through the crowd that had gathered, and they said, ""What happened?"" The people who were there first said, ""We don\'t know. He seemed to be alright when we got here, but by the time we had his head turned around straight, he was dead."" [Laughter]', ""So, we're going to try to keep everybody warm. And we're not going to try to turn their heads around straight. We're going to try to help them in the regular and old-fashioned American way, which is: direct the help in such a way as to make people self-sufficient and independent and no longer dependent on bureaucrats for a handout."", 'So, thank you, God bless you all, and happy going tomorrow.']"
7,Ronald Reagan ,"October 11, 1982","[""The President. Thank you very much, Jim. Reverend clergy, the officials of our party, our national committeewoman, the others who are here on the platform, and I want to say my thank you to the Apache Belles for that wonderful performance. I'm just sorry that with the geography, more of you couldn't have a clearer view of them."", ""It's great to be—incidentally, you know every once in a while, someone asks you why you campaign. Well, I just thought as I came walking down here between those two lines of those lovely young ladies, why not? [Laughter]"", 'But it\'s great to be back in these parts, where the Texas spirit is every bit as big as your wide open sky. Now, if you think I\'m just a visitor saying that for possible political profit, let me point out I could have said ""our wide open sky,"" because it was just about 25 years ago that I was commissioned an honorary citizen of the Lone Star State. So, you have to believe me when I say Texas is number one in hospitality, and a lot of other things, also.', 'You probably know that story about the young fellow that once asked a stranger if he was from Texas, and the kid\'s father kind of took him in hand and he said, ""Son, I want you always to remember one thing: If a man comes from Texas, he\'ll tell you without being asked""— [laughter] —""and if he doesn\'t come from Texas, there\'s no need to embarrass him."" [Laughter]But I want to say a few words about your Texas stars that we need to help us finish the job that we began less than 2 years ago. In 1980, we pledged to work for policies that would strengthen the values crucial to a strong, successful country. You know what they are, because here in Texas words like self-reliance, personal initiative, opportunity and, yes, as Jim said, love of family and neighborhood, and patriotism, and belief in God, describe everyday facts of life.', ""There's a man here whose philosophy and voting record reflect a life-long commitment to those bedrock values that made America great. He loves this State. He has put together a strong campaign. He has closed a big gap in a hurry. I believe in him, and with your all-out support, Jim Collins can and will be the next elected Senator from the State of Texas."", ""And I have to say this: Jim's opponent talks like a Texan, but when he's back in Washington, he doesn't vote like one. Wouldn't it be great if John Tower, who does such a fine job for Texas, could work with a colleague, his fellow Senator, who reinforces his vote, instead of with someone who cancels it out?"", 'We\'re hoping, too, that you will go all out for your excellent House candidates. We need them in Washington. And let me say a few words about your leader who\'s out campaigning and couldn\'t be here. He\'s going to have a debate, and he told me that some place in the debate he was going to find a place to say, ""There you go again."" [Laughter] His leadership, his competence—this is what he\'s all about. In this State, it isn\'t good enough to say that Texas has one of the toughest, most effective Governors in the country; you have to say Texas will elect the best Governor, and that means making sure Bill Clements stays right there where he is doing his great job. [Speaking to Jim Collins:] I almost nominated you for Governor just then. [Laughter]', 'Now, and this goes not only for these congressional candidates who are here and your incumbents, and sending them back, also your State constitutional officers—Allen Clarke is here running for treasurer.', ""You and I know what it means to be in the minority party. Our candidates need Republican and Democratic votes. I'm confident we'll continue to attract that broad support. The plain truth is rank-and-file Democrats by the millions in this country don't share the bigger-and-bigger-government-is-best philosophy of the Democratic leadership in Washington—the kind of leadership that Jim Collins was talking about. Millions of grass roots Democrats have something the leaders of their party wouldn't recognize if it was sitting on their nose, and that is plain common sense. You know, when you mention common sense in Washington, you cause a kind of a traumatic shock. [Laughter]"", ""These rank-and-file Democrats I'm talking about—and that we must count on for help and support because we have so much in common with them—they know you can't drink yourself sober, you can't spend yourself rich, and you can't pump the prime without priming the pump. You know something? I said that backwards. I didn't say that right at all. [Laughter] You can't prime the pump without pumping the prime is the way it should have been said the first time. It's a tongue-twister. [Laughter]"", ""The problems of overspending, big taxing, and runaway bureaucracy that drained America's strength didn't just begin 20 months ago. You and I know these problems have been building for at least 20 years. In the 4 years before we took office, those who are now our biggest critics had total power—the White House and both Houses of Congress. They had the whole enchilada. [Laughter] And it was then that the problems became acute and nearly brought America down."", 'When Gerald Ford left office in January 1977, inflation was 4.8 percent. The prime interest rate was under 7 percent. You could get a home mortgage for 9 percent, and consumers could afford auto loans.', 'But then America took a giant step backward, spending and taxing like there was no tomorrow, opening the floodgates of printing press money—it increased in the last 6 months of 1980 faster than it has ever increased in our history. Those in power managed to create a crisis unlike America had ever seen before. When we took office in 1981, we faced double-digit inflation, high unemployment, 21 1/2-percent prime interest rate, nearly a trillion-dollar debt, and the highest peacetime tax burden we had ever known.', ""Now, lest I be accused of exaggerating, or even being partisan, let me quote a Democratic Senator from Massachusetts. [Laughter] In May of 1980, Teddy Kennedy warned that under Jimmy Carter America was sliding into the worst recession since the Great Depression. Of course, he was a candidate himself then when he said that, and he didn't add that for years he has continued to be one of the biggest spenders in the United States Senate."", ""The bottom line in 1980 was an unacceptable decline in the wealth of the working families and senior citizens of America—the very people that our critics claim they care so much about. Government was growing like toadstools after a rainstorm, spinning out of control like a washing machine that's out of cycle. Washington grew fat by making everyone else poorer. Washington has a habit of doing that. Federal spending increased by 17 percent in 1980 alone. Not many Texas blue-collar workers, working mothers, or pensioners saw their earnings, pensions, or savings grow by 17 percent in 1980."", ""It's up to us to make one thing plain in this election: There is no morality in those big taxing, big spending policies which brought so much misery to so many people. Inflation is the greatest enemy of all the people and of our hopes for jobs and growth. It's at the root of the problems that we're trying to solve today."", 'How did it all come about? Well, the answer to that takes us back to the Great Depression, when Government assumed a role that was entirely new to it. Government launched programs which were, frankly, experimental. And many of them did serve a purpose, because they eased the misery of people for whom there was no other answer to their problem. But it was actually not those programs but World War II that ended the Depression. When the war was over, the Government went right back to its old habits and continued to administer the medicine it had applied before the war, but the patient then was no longer in need of that medicine. Many of us had believed in those prewar remedies and, indeed, as I say, some had served us well. But in more normal times, we came to see that many of these programs were distorting the balance between the different levels of government and working against the economy.', ""But the leadership of the Democratic Party remained addicted to a policy of government intervention, and we're paying dearly for those past mistakes. For one thing, as I said, there is the trillion-dollar debt. The Government this year must spend $110 billion just to cover the interest on that debt. We wouldn't be worrying about a deficit if we hadn't wallowed in red ink for 21 of the last 22 years. And we wonder why it's been so hard to bring interest rates down."", ""Now, far too many people are out of work, and I share their ache and frustration. Every American should be aware of the economic chaos which created today's needless results, so we won't repeat our past mistakes. It's excruciating to me that there is not a quicker, easier cure for this terrible economic illness. But it was a long time coming, and it is worldwide. Indeed, we have been in the longest sustained period of worldwide inflation in the history of man. Many other countries went down the same garden path of spend, tax, and borrow. The further they went, the worse off they are today. Our administration is determined to cure the disease, not just treat the symptoms with make-work, quick fixes. And I pledge to you today that I will not be satisfied until every American who wants a job can find a job."", ""From our first moment in office, we've been working around the clock to make America well again. And we're opposed by those who have never given up their belief that government's economic fine tuning and tinkering is superior to the free marketplace and the abilities of a free people to run their own lives."", ""Well, let me tell you something. Despite their resistance, we are beginning to succeed. We've pulled America back from the edge of disaster. Yes, I'd hoped that we'd be further along by now. But make no mistake, we're better off than we were 20 months ago. The problems that were destroying America in 1980 are being confronted today, and they're paving the way for recovery."", ""Our first emergency priority was to beat down double-digit inflation. Until people are convinced that inflation will come down and stay down, they'll demand higher rates of interest so the dollars they lend won't lose value. Expectation of double-digit inflation caused interest rates to zoom, as I said, to 21½ percent. High interest rates made it impossible for families to get home mortgages, for consumers to carry auto loans, for firms to modernize machines to keep product prices competitive. Double-digit inflation and high interest rates crippled the economy's ability to provide the jobs our people must have, even as they squeezed the earnings and buying power, forcing more families to seek a second income in the job market."", ""Our program has been on the books now for just 1 year and 11 days. The inflation rate that hit a peak of 18 percent in January of 1980 has been beaten down to 5.1 percent for the first 8 months of this year. Experts said it couldn't be done. For those experts, I've got news. We're going to do even better. The prime rate has dropped 40 percent, from 21 1/2 down to 13. And on Friday, the Mellon Bank announced it was going further, that tomorrow it will be 12 3/4. And that isn't the last word—[At this point, a 10-year-old girl fainted in the front row of the audience. She was attended to by paramedics. ]"", ""All right? We've got a doctor here. The young lady that I think that—all right. They tell me it's going to be all right."", 'The Federal Reserve, as you know, has dropped the discount rate from 10 to 9% [percent] just a few days ago.', ""Progress against inflation and the first real tax cut for everyone in nearly 20 years have produced more savings, higher real earnings, and more purchasing power. Families' paychecks are buying more."", ""We hear so much in Washington about fairness and compassion. Well, we're providing compassion that never existed under the policies of the past. A family of four today on a fixed income of about $20,000 is about $1,500 better off than if inflation and taxes had stayed at the 1980 rate. But take it below that, to the family with a poverty-level income. They are $500 better off than they were at the previous rate of inflation alone, because they don't pay taxes."", ""Some decisions were not easy. It was going against the wind of the times to curb runaway spending. Likewise, when we went to bat for taxpayers when others before us had refused, we revived an old idea that the earnings of the people of Texas belong to them, not to government handymen in Washington, D.C. And here's what that tax commitment means to you and your family. As of when the third installment comes in July next year, it will have been a 25-percent tax rate cut. We are then indexing the tax brackets to end the bracket creep when you get a cost-of-living pay raise—doesn't improve you any, except it pushes you into a higher tax bracket; a reduction in the marriage penalty; an increase in the child care credit for working mothers; new incentives for retirement savings; raising the estate tax exemption to $600,000 for farmers and family businesses-and, of even greater help, there will no longer be any estate tax for a surviving spouse. It's not right that widows and orphans must lose a business or a farm that generations of love and toil had created, just in order to pay the government a tax because of death. And now they won't. Of course, according to our opponents, there's no compassion in this."", ""Our program, I think, is beginning to work. It's bringing down inflation. It's bringing down interest rates. It's increasing purchasing power, and it's promoting new savings. It's doing the things that must be done to clear away wreckage dumped in our laps by today's Monday morning quarterbacks. Yes, we will have recovery from recession, but we will not have another counterfeit recovery like before that sent inflation and interest rates right back through the roof. Unlike those before us, we're going to get the job done, and for once, we're going to get it done right."", 'Now, you heard the charge that our program has failed and that we must change course. Well, I have one question: Has anyone heard a single proposal by our critics who say that, as to what they would do instead?Audience. No!', ""The President. Not one. They constantly criticize what we're doing, but they've offered no real alternative. If what we're doing is wrong, how do they explain the tremendous surge of investment in our equity and bond markets in the last few weeks—from small investors to those who manage billions of dollars, including workers' pension funds?"", ""The world knows that America is on her way back. And I'm pleased to announce a little news item right here. It's just happened. At the closing bell of the stock market on Wall Street a few minutes ago, the stock market was over the magic 1,000."", ""Now, so some of my friends in the press, if they get a later figure won't jump on it, let me point out— [laughter] —the bell had rung, the market was closed, but the tape-there was so much trading, the tape was 4 1/2 minutes behind. Now, in those 4 1/2 minutes, if somebody sells some stocks or the price comes down, well, they take a profit. But it did pass the 1,000 mark at the bell."", ""Investors have watched inflation fall and interest rates drop for months. Their commitment to put cold, hard cash on the line signals a strong vote of confidence in America's future. People are beginning to understand that we mean business in this battle against inflation, and they're absolutely right."", ""Markets will go up and they'll go down, but the recent trend has been dramatically higher. That's important, because the stock market has traditionally been a leading indicator of what's coming down the road."", ""Unfortunately, unemployment is not. It's one of the last indicators to turn around. Until it does, we'll provide assistance with extended unemployment benefits. Last week, I signed an export bill that can create several hundred thousand jobs. And this week, I will sign legislation for a program to train up to a million unemployed people or more per year, for permanent, real, private sector jobs."", ""I think it's tragic that the House leadership recessed to campaign, leaving so much unfinished business behind, as Jim Collins told you. Enterprise zones, we've been trying to get for almost 2 years, to create jobs in the inner cities; tuition tax credits; regulatory reform; programs to crack down on crime and make our streets safe again. Let me ask you, don't you think that rather than simply campaign and complain about deficits, it's about time they proved they were willing to make the decisions that would bring down deficits?"", 'Well, as Jim told you, they voted down the constitutional amendment to balance the Federal budget. They voted against the will of you, the people, and the financial security of every family in America.', 'And I just told a few people before coming out here today that immediately after that voting down of the balanced budget amendment, which all the polls showed that the people, about 80 percent of you wanted that amendment, he appeared on national television—Jim Wright appeared on national television and smilingly announced that, and then said, ""Well, if the President wants a balanced budget, why doesn\'t he present one?""', ""Well, Jim Wright has been one of the prime leaders in increasing the budgets, the two budgets that I have been able to send to the Congress since I've been there.-He has made them bigger with added spending than the budgets that I requested. So, I think there's a little hypocrisy in Mr. Wright's statement about the balanced budget amendment.People don't want delay and demagoguery. They want action, to reduce the burden of that terrible trillion-dollar debt on their children and grandchildren, and it's up to us to provide it. And I'm so happy that today, just like every day where I've been in this campaign, to see so many young people on hand, because they're what this campaign is all about, and the kind of country they're going to live in."", ""Now, you know, I have to say, of course, there are some things that are current today and sweeping the country that I haven't had time to get familiar with—Pac Man, for example. [Laughter] I don't know about him. I asked about it, and somebody told me that it was a round thing that gobbled up money. [Laughter] I thought that was Tip O'Neill. [Laughter]"", ""But I want to make a request. If you believe, as I do, that too many people in Washington are out of step, if you believe that we need reforms like the balanced budget amendment, then please send us a Congress that will pass these programs so we can make this great country of ours number one once again. If the liberals do have an alternative, it's the same one they've always had, and maybe that's why they're not mentioning it. They mean to raise your taxes and give government a blank check to spend more money, and we've been down that road now for more than 20 years."", ""We're on a new road now. Unless we have the courage to stay on course and lick inflation for good, we'll never have lasting recovery. Our problems will grow worse than before. And that's the sad, sorry history of past decades—lost nerve and squandered opportunities."", 'Well, I intend to stay the course. I need your support. I want you to promise me that you will mobilize an army across this State to get out the vote for a great Republican victory on November 2d. And let us remember that we Republicans have a rendezvous in this city in 1984. Let us remember that we have a mission to renew all the dreams and opportunities that our nation was placed on this Earth to provide. And let us remember the best way to make those dreams come true is to elect Jim Collins to the Senate, your fine candidates to the House, George Strake as Lieutenant Governor, Allen Clarke as treasurer, and to send Bill Clements back to your capital as Governor of this great State.Thank you very much, and God bless you.']"
8,Ronald Reagan ,"October 20, 1982","['The President. Senator Percy, the representatives, the Members of Congress who are here, the candidates who are here, Corrine Michel, who is here, and I too am very proud of my two good friends from another life that are here with us tonight—Mr. Mayor and, of course, the man whose campaign has brought us here, Bob Michel.', ""You know, I've been here before. I don't mean during the campaign. I was here then of course; and I don't mean in this fine, new facility. That's a first for me. But I remember coming here to play football against Bradley. And Bradley won that night, or I wouldn't have brought the subject up. But as enthusiastic as you are, I'm sure that you were—I thought maybe you were expecting the Bradley Braves. Bradley University has given us not only last year's NIT champions—and I just met them outside here—but it's given us that outstanding Republican leader of the House of Representatives, Bob Michel."", 'Bob is a graduate of Bradley. He\'s received an honorary doctorate from Bradley. He\'s a member of the board of trustees of Bradley. Bob, have you gone out for the team yet? [Laughter] Well, I tell you, if he did he would make a fine captain. He is one of the most effective Republican minority leaders of this century. But I dream of a day—I know it cannot happen in just one election—but I dream of a day when I can stand up here and say, ""a fine majority leader of the House of Representatives.""', ""Let me tell you something about Bob. He's been your Congressman for 13 terms, not because he likes the prestige—that gets old fast. He's not a Congressman because he likes being away from his family. He is not in it for the money. He could do a lot better out in the private sector. Bob Michel is a Congressman because he believes in something. He believes in the values of Illinois and the values that built this country. For 26 years he's been working for those beliefs and for you, the people who share them. I don't know what this country would do without the sacrifices of people like Bob Michel."", ""You know, there were times this year when he could have taken the easy way out on certain votes; yet he did what he believed was best for America. He put country before politics. Now he doesn't always agree with me, like on the pipeline sanction, but he makes his arguments genuinely and honestly, and they cannot be ignored. And that kind of integrity is hard to find."", ""I know how you feel, so I'm just going to say something. I think a man of Bob Michel's character and principle deserves a standing ovation from all of us, an ovation born of appreciation for what he has done. [Applause] Now, if I were still in show business, I'd have quit right there. [Laughter]"", ""Illinois has a lot of other fine Republicans, like Governor Thompson, whose reelection victory— [applause] —we'11 be celebrating his election victory in less than 2 weeks."", ""And there's another excellent Illinois Republican I'd like to mention—Ed Derwinski, one of the highest ranking Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. We don't want to lose Ed's experience when he leaves the Congress at the end of this session, so we've taken care of that. Tonight I'm announcing that I intend to nominate Congressman Derwinski to the post of Counselor at the State Department, a good man in one of the most important posts in our country."", ""But I also wanted to come tonight so I could speak directly to the people of this area, to the people who've lost their jobs at Caterpillar and Pabst and Hiram Walker. Bob has told me personally—and, I might say, eloquently—of the hardships of the people in his district. He understands what's going on out there. So, perhaps this might be a good time to say something about those pipeline sanctions."", ""I know they're not popular with Peoria or Bob Michel. But a President sometimes has to make decisions that are painful to even his best friends, and it's one of the toughest parts of the job. We must remember the sanctions were imposed as tangible evidence of our opposition to the Soviet inspired repression of the Polish people. But there were additional reasons, even had that not happened."", ""It seemed to us that our European friends and allies were putting themselves in a dangerous position of dependency on an undependable provider, the Soviet Union, for the energy that would run their industry. And it also seemed to us that, inasmuch as that dependency would turn over about $10 billion a year in hard, cold cash to the Soviet Union, it would enable them to further build up their military might which is the greatest buildup of military might the world has ever seen. And so, we felt that something had to be done. The sanctions have substantially hurt the Soviet Union already, but, of course, they've hurt some of our own companies such as Caterpillar as well."", ""The Siberian pipeline will be a major source, as I said, of hard cash income for the Soviet Union for decades, and I won't go into all the geopolitical reasons why that could be dangerous. I know it's the loss of jobs that's of more immediate concern to Peorians right now."", ""We're receptive to alternative measures that would be equally or more effective than the current sanctions. Certainly, if we can establish restrictions that put greater pressure on the Soviets and less on our own companies, we will enthusiastically consider them. And we've been in constant consultations with our NATO allies trying to bring that about."", ""Tonight in homes across the country, including a home at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, unemployment is the problem uppermost in everyone's mind. Getting Americans back to work is an urgent priority for all of us, and, other than keeping the peace, I have no higher priority."", 'You know, there\'s a story about a fellow who said to a friend of his, ""I was sorry to hear that your wife ran off with the gardener."" And the fellow said, ""Well, that\'s all right. I was going to fire him anyway."" [Laughter]', ""When it comes to the economy, that's about how scrambled the logic has been in recent years. And scrambled thinking led us to a scrambled economic mess."", ""Americans are asking themselves, how do we straighten out this mess? Well, you can't solve unemployment without solving the things that caused it—the out-of-control government spending, skyrocketing inflation, and the interest rates that led to unemployment in the first place. Unless you get at the root causes of the problem-which is exactly what we're doing—you may temporarily relieve the symptoms, but you'll never cure the disease."", ""I realize there is hardship in Peoria. And if I thought what we were seeking to accomplish would he only temporary, I wouldn't ask for your patience. But for the first time in our postwar history, we're trying to build a recovery that will last and not just a quick fix to see us through the election."", ""You know, before we went to Washington, those in charge of the economy ran it with the accelerator to the floor; then they'd slam on the brakes; then they'd swerve to miss the oncoming crisis; then they'd swerve back; and then they'd floor it again. But you can't run an economy or a ear that way without eventually wrecking it. And that's exactly what was happening."", 'In January of 1977, just after Jerry Ford left the White House, inflation was at 4.8 percent. The prime interest rate was under 7 percent. You could get a home mortgage for 9 percent, and consumers could afford not only mortgages but auto loans. But then America took a giant step backward.', 'How many of us remember we had 5 economic programs proposed in 4 years? Our economic policy was flip-flopping like a fish on dry land. And those five programs of the last administration left us with five gigantic headaches. But wait a minute-maybe I should only say four, because the fifth economic program was proposed in August just before the 1980 election, and that was the only one that proposed a tax cut. They said it would be $27 billion. Well, they never gave us the tax cut, and the program was never implemented.', ""By the time we took office, we faced double-digit inflation, high unemployment, a 21 1/2-percent prime interest rate, runaway government spending, and the highest peacetime tax burden we have ever known. We also had nearly a trillion-dollar debt. Now, that means that this year, before the Government can spend a dime to feed the hungry, care for the sick, or protect our freedom, it must plan to spend $110 billion in this one year just to pay the interest on that debt. $110 billion is much more than the total Federal budget was just 20 years ago. And still the big spenders wonder why the American people want what a stubborn minority in the House denied them—a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. They're going to get another chance to vote on that, because we're going to keep shoving it at them."", ""Our nation is still paying the penalty of those tragic excesses of the past. Unfortunately, many are paying with their jobs. I didn't cause this recession. Bob Michel didn't cause it. But I do have a responsibility for getting us out of this recession, and I can't do it without Bob Michel in the Congress."", ""We all want a strong and lasting economic recovery. And there isn't a Member of the House of Representatives more critical to making recovery happen than Bob Michel. Recovery means jobs. Bob Michel's reelection means jobs. From our very first day, we've been working to undo the economic wreckage that was left behind. As a matter of fact, when I finished taking the oath on office on that January Inaugural Day, the first thing I did was go back into the Capitol Building—and I didn't even take off my topcoat—I signed a memorandum freezing the size of the Federal Government."", ""At my age, I didn't go to Washington to play politics as usual. I didn't go there to reward pressure groups by spending other people's money. And most of all, I didn't go there to further mortgage the future of the American people just to buy a little Short-term, political popularity. I wanted to try and solve some problems, not sweep them under the rug and leave them for those who would come along later."", ""Now, I don't pretend for a moment that in 21 months we've been able to undo the damage of 20 years or more. Twenty-one months ago, we faced five immediate and critical problems: runaway spending; double-digit inflation; the worst interest rates in a hundred years; the highest peacetime tax burden, as I've said, in our history; and high unemployment. But we've made dramatic gains on four of those five problems."", ""The inflation rate that reached a high of 18 percent in January of 1980 has been cut to 5.1 percent for the first 8 months of this year. The experts said it couldn't be done, but we did it. The prime interest rate, that had reached 21 1/2 percent before we came to office, is now down to 12 percent, and we're not finished with it yet. We've cut the annual growth in spending—government spending—by nearly two-thirds. And we will have cut tax rates 25 percent by next July."", ""And look what's been happening to the stock and bond markets. They're trying to pooh-pooh that a little bit on the other side. But if you haven't noticed, the market today closed 20 points up at 1034 plus .12, and that is the highest point the market has hit since early 1973, 10 years ago."", ""Confidence is returning to America's economy. Sadly, unemployment is always just about the last to feel a recovery. If you'd look at the charts that they can show you of those seven preceding recessions, and they go up in a big—and then they go down. But each time, when they come out of the recession, unemployment stays a little higher than it was the time before. So, it always starts from a higher level. That's why the other day I said that I'd take the responsibility for the 2.7 percent that unemployment's gone up since I took office, if they'll take responsibility for the 7.8 percent that it was up before we took office. But we're going to beat that just as we're beating the rest of the economic problems. And when we get it licked, this time, it's going to stay licked."", 'Now I just want to see if you\'ve been paying attention this evening. So, I\'d like to give you a little true-false exam. Having gone to school not too far from here, I\'m feeling very academic. [Laughter] If the statement I read is true, you say ""true,"" and if it\'s false, you say ""false.""', ""First question, we've knocked the inflation rate down by half and—or more—and we're going to keep it down there.Audience. True."", ""The President. We've reduced interest rates in this country, and we're going to reduce them even further.Audience. True."", ""The President. Here's a hard one. We've cut both the growth in Federal spending and Federal income tax rates, and we're not letting either one of them rise again.Audience. True."", ""The President. We're going to beat that devil unemployment and provide real and lasting jobs for the people of this nation.Audience. True."", ""The President. I want the people of Illinois, the people of America—well, wait a minute, here's the last one. Bob Michel is the best darn Congressman this district ever had.Audience. True."", ""The President. We'll send you your certificates of graduation right after November 2d. Well, you pass. I knew this was a smart area; that's why you keep sending him back to Congress."", ""We're on a new road now, a road that's leading America to better times. But we've got to keep the courage to stay our course. It's the only way to lasting recovery. If we don't, our problems will just grow worse than they were before. And that's the sad, sorry history of past decades—lost nerve and squandered opportunities. The people deserve better from their leaders. And I want all of you to know this: that I intend to stay the course and to turn this economy around, and I need your help to do that."", 'So, please promise me that you will mobilize your friends and neighbors to get out the vote for a great victory on November 2d for Bob Michel. We have a mission to renew all the dreams and the hopes that our nation was placed on this good Earth to provide.', ""I met someone else before I came out here tonight—a young lady, sixth grade of Sterling School, who has won a statewide essay contest. And she won it with a letter that she wrote to our country. And I was pleased to meet her. Maybe you've all seen the letter, but let me just remind you, if you haven't, that first sentence. She wrote, as I say, it as a letter."", '""Dear America, I just thought I would write you a letter to let you know how great I think you are."" And at the close of her letter, she said, ""It really doesn\'t matter whether we\'re black or white, atheist or Christian. Your doors of opportunity are always open. So, knock, knock, America, here I come.""', ""The Stacy Hodgkins and all those young people and the young people that are here tonight, they're what this election is all about—what kind of an America we're going to leave them. And I pray every day of my life that before we leave the stage, we will have made some payments—installment payments on that trillion-dollar debt and not leave all of it for them to take care of. And the best way, the most immediate way to keep our rendezvous with destiny and to achieve those dreams and those hopes that I spoke of is to reelect Bob Michel and those from other districts—send these other Representatives back, Send these candidates into office, and let's have a turn at being the majority in Washington and see what we can do for the people of this country.Thank you all, and God bless you.""]"
9,Ronald Reagan ,"October 21, 1982","[""The President. Thank you very much. I can't tell you how pleased I am to be here at this nonpartisan gathering. [Laughter] No, it's great to be back here and to see so many friendly faces. I feel like I'm coming home to old friends and neighbors. As a matter of fact, the Governor just informed me a little while ago that he used to listen to me when I was Dutch Reagan on WHO-Des Moines. Of course, he then added he only listened to me when the Cards were playing the Cubs, because he was a Card fan. So, he's a very happy fellow today."", ""But, you know, there's one big difference between Nebraska and Washington—you've got your priorities straight. Now, in Washington, too many in the Congress vote against balanced budgets so they can run up big, red-ink deficits. Here in Nebraska, a balanced budget is an article of faith between you and your leaders, and the only Big Red in your State is a football team. Back in those broadcasting days, I have described that team a number of times when I was a sports announcer doing play-by-play football broadcasts."", ""But let me just say a few words about your Governor, and I'm mighty proud to stand here with him today. He doesn't just believe in your Nebraska bedrock values-values like self-reliance, love of family, patriotism, and faith in God. I've known Charlie Thone and valued his friendship for a long time. I've seen the job he's done, and no one works harder or has done more to increase Nebraska's farm and industrial exports. He doesn't play both sides of an issue; he's a man who says what he means, means what he says, and does what he promises. Charlie Thone has stood by Nebraska through sun and storm. He's earned your support. And if you give it to him—and I mean all of it—he'll stay right where he belongs, doing his great job as your Governor."", ""Now, we gave him a problem in Washington. I understand how your tax system is geared to the Federal income tax. And then when we changed the Federal income tax and reduced it, he was faced with having to make a rate change in order to not change your tax. But those who said that he raised your taxes in doing that are lying in their teeth. He had a hard decision to make, and he made it. And now I understand that he is faced, as we're faced in Washington, with having in these hard times to make some adjustments in State budgeting and in cutting government spending. And that's the approach that he's taking. And I'd like to know who in America—well, I do know who in America, but I don't like them- [laughter] —thinks that's wrong. The right way to change is to reduce government spending."", ""We need your excellent Representatives that he named up here—Doug Bereuter, Hal Daub, Virginia Smith—back in Washington. And wouldn't it be great if we had an outstanding Senate candidate, Jim Keck, be the outstanding Senator that I know he could be?"", ""Let me, if I could, because there is some mystery to many people about the way things work there in Washington and what that means—as he told you, the first time we've had a Republican Senate in 26 years. As a matter of fact, all the past Republican Presidents, all the way back to the war, only for one 2-year period, has a Republican President served with a Republican legislature, a Republican Congress."", ""And here's what it means to have—we only have a slight majority in that Senate. But that slight majority is so important, because having that majority means our party names the committee chairmen; our party names the majority to the committees. And look at the difference in this last session that we've just been through. The balanced budget amendment, which 80 percent of the people in this country said they wanted, passed out of the Senate with a two-thirds majority. For a year, it was held in the House in committee and not allowed to come to the floor for a vote, because they control the majorities and the chairmen of the committees in that other House. Finally it came out when 218 signed a petition to bring it to the floor. And it got a majority vote, but it fell short of the two-thirds it needs. But I've got news for them: They're going to have another chance to vote on that balanced budget amendment, because we're going to keep presenting it."", ""Your train here today—and I might add with a very lovely cargo—represents a great success story—an industry of new growth, of jobs, and progress, carrying your people and their goods toward brighter horizons and a better life. It wasn't long ago that people were saying that rail industry couldn't make it without government subsidies. Well, we're seeing proof of how wrong they were. This industry has turned around; it's getting stronger. The payoff is more jobs and opportunities, and that's darn good news for Nebraska. And part of the reason that it can do that is because we've been lifting the stultifying hand of government regulations that's been hindering business and industry in this country for too many years."", ""Let me speak a moment about another turnaround, another comeback story: Our economy is turning around. Our critics are saying our economy is on its knees. Well, you know something, if the economy is back on its knees, that's quite an improvement because 2 years ago it was flat on its back."", ""A little less than 2 years ago when we went to Washington, all those years of government living beyond its means had come to roost with a terrible vengeance. Today's Monday morning quarterbacks have already forgotten the monster they left us: spending shooting up at an annual rate of 17 percent; double-digit inflation, 2 years in a row of that; high unemployment; a 21 1/2-percent interest rate, the highest in more than a century; and nearly a trillion-dollar debt, which if we don't correct things soon is going to be handed as a heritage from us to these wonderful young people who are here today. And I'm determined that must not happen. And we were having the highest tax burden, peacetime tax burden, that the people of this country had ever known."", ""Now, I don't want it reported that I'm being partisan here, so let me quote a source from the other side—way on the other side. [Laughter] It happens to be the senior Democratic Senator from the State of Massachusetts. In May of 1980 Ted Kennedy warned that under his party's leadership America was sliding into the worst recession since the Great Depression. So you see, it isn't true that he and I don't agree on everything."", ""In 1980 government was growing like toadstools after a rainstorm, spinning out of control like a washing machine that was out of cycle. Washington and the bureaucracy were growing fatter and fatter while they were making everyone else poorer and poorer. Think about that trillion-dollar debt. This year, the Government will have to spend $110 million just to pay the interest on that debt. That is much greater than the total Federal budget was just 20 years ago. That's about $3,500 for every time your heart beats."", ""We wouldn't be worrying about a deficit today if big spenders hadn't wallowed in red ink for 21 of the last 22 years. And we wonder why it's so hard to bring down interest rates, make more money available to your consumers and small businessmen and family farmers. But those in the Congress who have spent your hard-earned dollars with such glee still resist the medicine of a balanced budget amendment. They claim it would be a dangerous risk. Well, there is no more dangerous risk to America or the loved ones that we'll leave behind us than deliberate, planned inflation that would destroy our country, and we're not going to permit that."", 'Here in America\'s heartland, farmers are still paying dearly for the mistakes of the past. The sky-high inflation and interest rates of the late seventies and that mistaken Soviet grain embargo led to a vicious cost-price squeeze and lost markets. Confidence in America as a reliable supplier was shattered. Those in Washington forgot what Dwight Eisenhower once warned: ""Without a prosperous agriculture there can be no prosperity in America."" Well, we\'re remembering, and with your help, we\'re going to put the pieces back together.', ""As I told the people of this country in my television address last week, I didn't go to Washington to play politics as usual, to spend other people's money, to sweep long-neglected problems under the rug. I went there to face up to those problems and, with your support and prayers from wonderful Americans like yourself, to begin to solve them."", ""Together we have pulled America back from the edge of disaster. We are solving those problems. No, we haven't been able, in 21 months, to clear away the wreckage that had built up for more than 20 years. Bob Dole kind of described that the other day in a speech out in Kansas another way. He kind of likened it to a stable that you couldn't unpile what—well— [laughter] .—"", ""Much of the legislation that we need still hasn't been enacted, but we're taking action. And of those five critical problems I mentioned—runaway spending, runaway taxing, double-digit inflation, record interest rates, and high unemployment—we've already made solid progress on four. And in anybody's league, four out of five's not bad."", 'First, we cut that bankrupt government spending growth by nearly two-thirds. Second, despite tremendous resistance from the big spenders, we passed the first real tax reduction for all American taxpayers in nearly 20 years. And that tax bill was not a giveaway to the rich; that was an across-the-board tax cut that benefited everyone in this country and today is benefiting those at the bottom of the scale probably even better than it is those at higher earnings and at the upper level of the scale.', ""Here's what it means for your families: When next July 1st comes and the third installment of the income tax cut is put in place, it'll be a total of a 25-percent personal rate cut. Then indexing will follow in 1985, to protect you from being pushed into higher tax brackets when you get a cost-of-living pay raise. And that's what's been happening. Inflation has been one of the finest tax increases—the highest tax increases—that our government has managed for all these inflationary years."", ""A reduction in the marriage penalty—the unfairness of the fact that a working husband and wife were cheated in the amount that they had to pay, it being greater than if they weren't married. A reduction—or an increase in the child care credit for working mothers—does that sound like it's a benefit for the rich? New incentives for retirement savings—again, hardly something that benefits the rich. And a major benefit for family farmers and family businesses. We're raising the estate tax exemption, in installments, to $600,000. And of even greater help, there will no longer be any estate tax for a surviving spouse. It's not right for widows and children to lose a business, to have to give up a business or a farm that generations of love and toil had created, just in order to pay the Government a tax because of death in the family. And now they won't have to do that."", ""Third, that double-digit inflation rate hit 18 percent in January of 1980. It is now down for the first 8 months of this year to 5.1 percent and has been even lower in the most recent of those months. The experts said that it couldn't be done. They said that it was institutionalized inflation in our system; no way to get rid of it. Well, we've got news for them. We did it, and we're going to do even better. It's going to come below where it is."", ""And fourth, we don't have a 21 1/2-percent prime rate anymore; we have a 12-percent prime rate, and that's not finished going down yet, and I predict it'll go down more before this year is over."", 'Now, that leaves unemployment, which everyone knows is far too high. But just as surely as single-digit inflation started the interest rates tumbling, getting interest rates down will drive unemployment back down to single digits, too. And then we will have delivered the knockout blow to the recession once and for all.', 'We are on course to recovery, but not another counterfeit recovery like all those other seven in the past that sent inflation and interest rates shooting right back through the roof. I wish you could see some of the charts that we have of what has been happening in recent years: to see this peak and then drop into recession, and then this artificial stimulant of the money supply and so forth, the quick fixes that they employed, and things would go back up, only 2 years later to go back down into a recession. But each time the recovery came we have noted that the unemployment rate stayed higher than it was before the recession, so that each time we started increasing unemployment from a higher base, and now we have the present rate of unemployment.', ""But we're on course to recovery, not, as I say, another counterfeit recovery. Unlike some before us, this administration is determined to get the job done and to get the job done right. You hear so much in Washington, of course, with all of this, about fairness and compassion. Well, we're providing compassion that never existed under the policies of the past. It's easy for all of us, because we're the most generous people on Earth, to feel sorry for that person who through no fault of their own must have help from the rest of us. And nothing is ever going to change that in this country. We're going to continue doing that. But under the policies of the past, in the empire building that goes on in government, there was only one way to go in enlarging those programs and enlarging the bureaucracy. They had to keep raising the levels at which people became eligible for those helpful programs until people who had no moral right to be receiving benefits from their fellow taxpayers were getting them."", ""But, yes, we've cut back on some programs, trying to correct that and be able to continue helping the people of real need. But what we've done without any expensive government programs is bring them help of a different kind. You know, a family at the poverty-income level today is about $500 better off because of the drop in inflation. Their purchasing power has increased that much. The average family of four on a fixed income of about $20,000 is about $1,500 better off than if inflation and taxes had stayed at their 1980 rates. And none of these called for any bureaucracy or none of them called for any high administrative overhead on presenting some kind of a grant. We've just made their money buy more than it was buying. Inflation is the tax they were having to pay, because those at the bottom level didn't have any income upon which to pay a tax."", ""There's an example that has to do with the Aid for Dependent Children. During the decade of the seventies, their grants were increased by a full one-third. In that same decade, their ability to purchase declined by almost a third. So that now, even the people on those benefit grants, because of their need, are better off and have more purchasing power than they did before."", ""For farmers trapped in that vicious cost-price squeeze, our progress against inflation and interest rates spells R-E-L-I-E-F, if a well-known football player in a commercial will forgive me for saying that. It can make a life and death difference. The price of fuel, so important to farmers, has actually dropped in real terms. And each decline of 1 percentage point in the interest rate on the farm debt will translate into a $2 billion reduction in interest costs to farmers in America. And that's not all."", ""We didn't put that Soviet grain embargo on your farmers, but, as the Governor told you, we took it off. And as you heard last Friday, we want to sell the Soviets a lot more grain, a total of 23 million metric tons, and we will guarantee—give assurances of reliable delivery. And we share Governor Thone's determination to increase your exports throughout the world."", ""From the first moment we took office we've been working to cure our terrible economic disease and make America well again. Oh, yes, I hear those who say that we haven't done enough. And there's a double standard there. Why won't they accept responsibility for what they did during the last 25 years when they controlled both Houses of the Congress? But they insist on demanding that we take full blame for not producing a miracle in less than 25 months."", ""But I've listened and I've listened to their criticism, and I've waited to see if they'd propose an alternative. And they don't. All they have to offer is a blind return to big spending, big taxing, more regulations, meddling, and make-work, more government coming through the windows, under the doors, and down the chimney. And I don't think that's an alternative for the American people."", ""And if you don't believe that the big spenders will go back to their old ways, then you believe that J. R. Ewing 1 when he promises that he'll never be unfaithful again.

With all the hopeful signs we now see—inflation and interest rates down sharply, real wages, savings, retail buying, housing starts, and investment up again—why do our critics seem so down in the mouth? Why do they seem so ready to stir up more fear and anxiety which can only hold back recovery? There is a psychological element to a recession-if people just start hunkering down and saying it\'s going to get worse, but if people say, ""Wait a minute. You know we\'ve done it before, we can do it again."" You have to ask, do those critics in this election year, do they really want a recovery? Or would they be smiling broadly if things were getting worse, simply because it might be politically advantageous to them?', 'Franklin Roosevelt warned that fear can paralyze us. Let us turn away from voices of fear and doom, and move forward together to embrace recovery with confidence and courage.

10,Ronald Reagan ,"October 26, 1982","[""Your Senators, your Representatives, the officials of our party, our national chairman, the candidates who are up here, you ladies and gentlemen:Nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina. Your beautiful State is rich in tradition and strong in character, dreams, drive, courage, refusing to quit—they've made the difference in North Carolina before, and they make the difference now. If you want the proof, watch the Wolfpack and the Tar Heels."", ""You know, you taught me a thing or two about that winning spirit. I haven't forgotten a great turning point in my life, our great primary victory here that got everything rolling in 1976. And I haven't forgotten an even bigger victory in 1980, when we were together again. Now, of course, I should be saying a thank you, but really I'm back to ask a favor. Please, go out there and work for your great candidates so this year we can make it three for three."", ""You have great candidates. First is Congressman Bill Hendon from your 11th District. He's been a real star in his freshman class—and I'm a member of that class, too. Bill is locked in a tough race, and it would be a tragedy if we didn't have him back in January. With your support, he'll be back."", ""And then there's Congressman Gene Johnston, another great Congressman from the Sixth District. I've been very grateful to have his support, and we can't afford to lose him. Nor can we afford to lose your two fine, experienced Representatives from the 9th and 10th Districts, Congressmen Jim Martin and Jim Broyhill."", ""Let me just say a few words about these tigers you have for challengers. Bill Cobey from the Fourth District, he's bright, and I understand he's done some mighty good recruiting for one of your great universities. I think that anyone who can produce that many champions is a champion himself and deserves to be elected."", ""Then there's Anne Bagnal from the Fifth District. She was part of our ticket in 1980 and just barely fell short. And if you can convince responsible Democrats and Independents to get behind her this year, she's going to make it, and we need her."", ""There's someone else coming on real strong in the Eighth District. He's put together a great campaign, and today, Harris Blake is in a position to win."", 'And how about that articulate challenger running in the Second District? With your help, Jack Marin will score big on November 2d, just like he scored all those baskets for the Duke Blue Devils.', ""Now, on election day let's also remember Jim McIntyre and Ed Johnson, two dedicated, principled conservatives, running hard in the First and Seventh Districts. And I want to mention one other candidate. He was commanding officer of the aircraft carrier the U.S.S. Lexington. A POW in North Vietnam, he was condemned to a living hell of torture for a period of a long 6 years. The Communists hadn't reckoned on this man's courage. They didn't realize you can't destroy the spirit of a true American hero. You can't trample on his faith; you can't kill his feelings of hope and love when he's tasted the truth of a better life."", 'In his book, ""Scars and Stripes,"" Red McDaniel wrote that the greatest moment of his life was seeing his wife Dorothy waiting with open arms, a reunion he dreamed about every night for those 6 years. And when he threw his arms around his family, he said it was worth it all for this moment. I think it\'s time to give him another fine moment, being elected your Congressman from North Carolina\'s Third District.', ""Well, like Red McDaniel, I, too, have a special moment I've dreamed about, and I think that many of you've shared this one. It'll be that day when we can tell our children and our grandchildren that we have begun to pay off this nation's national trillion-dollar debt, and some of the burden will be spared that coming generation."", 'Now, the problems we face today don\'t require the same sacrifices that heroes like Red were called upon to make. But they do require courage—courage to look to the future rather than cling to the past; courage to say, ""I will carry on,"" rather than, ""I give up;"" and courage to believe in our hopes rather than to be ruled by our fears. Only by believing in each other, by living up to the values we share, by trusting in the God who has blessed our land, can we Americans solve the problems that have hit our nation.', ""Well, I have some good news for you. Just as you were told a few moments ago, we are changing the direction of America. We're putting her back on the course of hope that was charted by our Founding Fathers. We've begun to handcuff the big spenders, to get the Federal Government off your backs, promote economic recovery, and put you, the people, back in charge of your country again. With your support and with the help of your fine Representatives and your two great Senators, Jesse Helms and John East, we're clearing away the economic wreckage that was dumped in our laps."", ""Now, of course you'd never believe that if you listened to the drumbeat of doom and gloom from our critics. They say our economy is on its knees. Well, do you know something: If our economy is on its knees, that's a big improvement, because 2 years ago it was flat on its back."", ""Today's Monday morning quarterbacks have already forgotten the monster that they left us: spending shooting up at an annual rate of 17 percent; double-digit inflation; high unemployment; a 21 ½-percent prime interest rate, the highest in more than a hundred years; nearly a trillion dollars in debt; and the highest peacetime tax burden this country had ever known."", ""But those in Congress who spent your hard-earned dollars with such glee still resist the medicine of a balanced budget amendment. They claim it'd be a dangerous risk. Well, let me make one thing plain: There is no more dangerous risk to America or to the loved ones we leave behind than deliberate, planned inflation such as they gave us, and which could destroy our country. Only we're not going to let it."", ""Let me assure you, there are two other struggles we'll never give up on: protection of innocent human life of an unborn child and the right of your children to begin their school days the same way the Members of the United States Congress begin theirs—with prayer."", ""Together, we've pulled America back from the edge of disaster. Of those five critical problems that I mentioned that we inherited—runaway spending, runaway taxing, double-digit inflation, record interest rates, and high unemployment—we have already made solid progress on four. And that's a pretty good beginning—four out of five."", ""First, we cut that bankrupt government spending growth by nearly two-thirds. Second, we passed the first real tax cut for all American taxpayers in nearly 20 years. And, by the way, I've been biting my tongue about something that needs to be said. The people who constantly beat their breasts about fairness are the same ones who raised taxes during the seventies in the biggest single tax increase our nation has ever had—raised it to the unbearable levels on hard-working American families. And then, when we arrived in 1981, they tried to stop us from giving you any kind of a tax cut."", ""And now they say they aim to repeal the third installment, that third year of your tax cut that's due next July 1st, and indexing-which will follow that—which is to stop you from being shoved up into higher tax brackets simply because you get a cost-of-living pay raise. Now, that would mean, if they had their way, a loss of about $2,500 over the next 5 years for the average American family. It's about time the people who blow so much smoke about compassion started showing some real compassion for the people who pay this country's bills. We will • protect your tax cut."", ""Third, we're helping to lighten the load of your own bills by beating down that double-digit inflation and the price increases that it brings. Inflation hit 18 percent in January of 1980. We're doing a little better than that; we're doing a lot better. It's back to where it was—believe it or not—well, I just have to say that, as of yesterday, I would have still had to say that we reduced inflation from that 18 down to 5.1 percent. But this morning at 8:30 eastern time, the news came out about September. And it's kind of an interesting coincidence. The inflation rate now for this year, the 9 months of 1982, is 4.8 percent. And, by coincidence, it is exactly the same 4.8 percent that it was when Jerry Ford left office—the last Republican President—because that's what it was then."", ""You know, it's hard to mince words, because in these difficult first 21 months we've managed to undo much of the damage of those irresponsible big tax and big spending policies that those who came after President Ford insisted were good for America."", ""You know, as a matter of fact, someone asked me this morning before I got on the plane up there about the situation, and I just happened to think that they're blaming us, you know, consistently for the high unemployment, which is a great tragedy—and they're blaming us for that. And if we're to blame for that, how come they say that we're not responsible also for all these reductions that I've just told you about?"", ""That progress against inflation has reduced that prime interest rate from 21 1/2 percent by nearly 50 percent. It's down to between 11½ and 12. And whether your livelihood is farming or homebuilding or steel or automobiles, retailing or other, this great progress means more hope, more jobs, confidence, and security for America—and that's mighty good news."", ""Certainly, as I indicated, as we meet today, unemployment remains far too high. But just as surely as single-digit inflation started interest rates coming down, getting those interest rates down so that people can buy automobiles and take mortgages out on homes and so forth, that will dramatically drive unemployment back down to single digits, too. And then we will have delivered a knockout blow to recession once and for all. So, unlike some before us, we intend to get the job done and get it done right this time so that it'll stay."", ""And I hear those who say we haven't done enough. I think there's a double standard there. They won't accept responsibility for what they did in 25 years that they controlled both Houses of the Congress, but they want us to take the full blame for not producing a miracle in less than 25 months."", ""But the real truth is, our critics are playing with the people's fears, trying to scare them into believing that things will get worse so their own political fortunes will get better. The picture of fear and despair that they paint on the network evening blues— [laughter] —that's a picture of America where she was, not where she's going. We didn't create the grain embargo, and we didn't create double-digit inflation or 21½-percent interest rates that caused so much misery. We ended them."", ""America has a future of courage and hope—hope that grows brighter as more people respond to the drop in inflation, tax rates, and interest rates. Not every statistic is strong yet, but look at the trend. Real wages, adjusted for inflation—real wages are up. Retail sales are up; housing starts and permits are up; the value of the dollar is up; productivity is up; research and development spending is up; venture capital in small business near a record. And, while you're hearing all the story about bankruptcies in these times of stress, business new starts—the starting up of new businesses is near a record high."", ""Personal savings is at a 6-year high, and new IRA accounts are pumping $30 to 35 billion into savings and investment that can then be used to provide jobs. Can there be any doubt that what all this means—that slowly, surely, confidence is being restored, and America will lead the world out of this worldwide recession that we're all in?"", ""This great country of ours is ready to move again. It's time that others stopped trying to scare the people and subvert recovery. If they can't encourage, if they won't work with the rest of us, then let them get out of the way."", ""We all could recite the criticisms. We've all heard all the things that they've said that we're supposedly doing wrong. But has anyone heard them suggest an actual alternative? All they can talk about or think about—they don't dare mention it in this election year—is they'll go right back, if given the chance, to more big spending, big taxing, more regulations, more meddling and make-work, more big government coming through the windows, under the door, and down the chimney."", ""One week from today you and millions of Americans will have a private moment in a voting booth, the place where you have as much influence and power as any other American in this country. When all of you prepare for that moment, I urge you to consider some very important questions. Ask yourselves: Will we create more jobs by returning to the old policies that sent those interest rates skyrocketing? Will we create more jobs by returning to old policies that gave us back-to-back years of double-digit inflation? Will we create more jobs by going back to the old policies that taxed working families as if they were millionaires? Or is there a better way? Do you think that the program that all of us worked so hard to pass, a program that is still so young, but that has already brought down the spending growth, the tax rates, the inflation, the interest rates—do you think that program deserves just a little more time to fix the one remaining problem—unemployment—so we can put people back on the job and get this country back on its feet?

As chairman of the Subcommittee on Public Lands and Reserved Water, he shepherds legislation crucial to your State."", 'Leadership, hard work, experience, loyalty to Wyoming—that\'s what Malcolm Wallop is all about. But he has something else that\'s mighty important—honesty and honor. Malcolm Wallop is the ""real McCoy,"" because he sticks to his word, and he sticks by you, the people of Wyoming. And, you know, that\'s very important, because many of us have tended to forget that in the beginning of our country, the two Senators from each State were sent there by the State to be a body representing the States, the sovereign States, keeping alive the idea that this nation is a federation of sovereign States, not 50 administrative districts of the Federal Government. Whether it be working for prosperity and peace—the peace we all want for our children, for these young people who are here today, or protecting the pensions of senior citizens, who\'ve already given so much, Malcolm Wallop has a solid record of keeping faith.', ""And, you know, having mentioned those senior citizens, I can predict that in these last few days of the campaign nationwide, our opponents are going to broadcast widely one of the most dishonest canards that has ever been fostered in a political campaign. They are going to tell you that we—and I really include myself, because I'm kind of a target of that—that we are some way out—some way we're on our way to changing or reducing or doing away with social security. And let me tell you that is what I said before—a falsehood."", ""I pledged during the campaign, when we were aware that social security has some fiscal problems that must be resolved to keep the program's integrity, those problems must be solved, but not at the expense of taking anything away from the people who are presently dependent on their social security checks.

Dick's leadership as chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee is remarkable for someone who was just first elected 4 years ago. We need his strong leadership back in the House in Washington."", ""And I know that your former statehouse speaker, Warren Morton of Casper, is a man of great experience, and he would make a fine Governor. And I'm an ex-Governor saying that. He will bring to Wyoming the same responsible principles of government that we're trying so hard to bring to Washington.

They say the economy is on its knees. Well, you know, if the economy is on its knees, that's quite an improvement, because 2 years ago it was fiat on its back."", ""The truth is, thanks to your courage, your patience, and your support, we've already accomplished a minor miracle: We've pulled America back from the edge of disaster. Of the five worst economic problems that we inherited—runaway spending, runaway taxing, double-digit inflation, record interest rates, and high unemployment-we have already made solid progress on four of them, and that's not a bad beginning."", 'First, we cut that bankrupt government spending growth by nearly two-thirds. Second, we passed the first real tax cut for all American taxpayers in nearly 20 years.', ""You know, so many of those people who constantly beat their breasts about fairness are the same ones who raised taxes during the 1970's to unbearable levels on hardworking American families. In 1977, they passed the biggest single tax increase in our history, and it still has further installments of increase built into the law that will go into effect between now and 1990, the payroll tax. And then when we arrived in 1981, they tried to stop us from giving any tax cut at all."", ""And now that we've got some of it, they're aiming and they've made public that it is their intention to repeal that third-year tax cut, the 10-percent income tax cut that is due next July—and the indexing, which keeps you from being pushed into a higher tax bracket when you get a cost-of-living pay raise.You know, inflation has not been an accident. It's a tax by which government, without having to bear the onus of passing a tax bill, can get more money out of your pockets through that thing called bracket creep. So, their idea of fairness means the average family of four, if they have their way, would lose more than $2,500 in tax benefits over the next 5 years."", ""It's about time the people who blow so much smoke about compassion start showing some real compassion for people like you who pay the country's bills. Well, I know and I cannot only speak for myself but for these gentlemen here on the platform, and that is, we're going to protect that tax cut, and you're going to continue to get the other installments that are still due."", ""Just consider one Of the features of that tax cut which Malcolm and Alan and Dick worked so hard to get. It contains a major benefit for you: family farmers, for ranchers, for family-owned businesses. We're raising the estate tax exemption to $600,000. Of even greater help, there will no longer be any estate tax for a surviving spouse."", ""Now, some say when you talk about fixing the estate tax, you're talking about very rich people. No, you're not. You're talking about the corner grocer. You're talking about the farmer. You're talking about the people who, because of inflation having increased the value of the property, find that, if there is death in the family, the widow and the children who might remain no longer have that source of support because it has to be sold to pay the government's tax on death. Well, that's not going to happen anymore."", ""And third, we're trying to lighten the load on your family budget by beating down double-digit inflation. It hit 18 percent in January of 1980. We're doing a little better. As a matter of fact, we're doing a lot better, Inflation is all the way down to 4.8 percent in 1982. And, you know, I could have said it's back down to 4.8 percent, because the last time it was 4.8 percent was when the last Republican President, Jerry Ford, left office. And we're not finished yet. We're going to bring it down even lower. 1982 could go down in history as the best performance against inflation in the last 10 years."", ""Fourth, our dramatic progress against inflation has enabled us to knock down that 21 1/2-percent prime interest rate that we inherited by nearly 50 percent. It's now down to between 11 1/2 and 12. I say that because it's 11 1/2 in some banks, 11 3/4 in others, and 12 in the rest. And that's going to come down more."", ""So, that's four out of five, and that leaves us with unemployment, which remains far too high. But just as surely as single-digit inflation started the interest rates tumbling, getting these interest rates down will drive unemployment back down to single digits, too. And then, we'll have delivered a knockout blow to the recession once and for all."", 'And I say ""once and for all,"" because it won\'t be like those seven previous recessions that we\'ve had since World War II, when our opponents had controlled the Congress for 26 straight years, and every time there was a recession they applied the gimmick of big government spending, bigger deficits, and the quick fix. And all it led to was a little temporary boost, and then 2 years later we were right back in another recession.', 'Just this week, the National Association of Realtors came to Washington to report to me a surge of homebuying in early October that was far above the average for this time of year. That surge of buying means that housing is becoming affordable for more Americans again, and this will mean more jobs. Unlike some before us, this administration intends to get the job done but to get it done right for a change.', ""Now, I hear those who say that we haven't done enough. But, you know, there's a kind of a little inconsistency, a double standard there. They won't accept responsibility for what they did in the 25-plus years they controlled the Congress, but they demand that we take full responsibility for not producing a miracle in less than 25 months."", ""Well, the truth is, our opponents sometimes sound to me, particularly in this election year, as if they don't really want a recovery. Their only concern is a political victory. Well, we didn't create the grain embargo. We didn't create double-digit inflation. We didn't create the 21 1/2-percent interest rates which caused so much misery on Main Street and the farm; we ended them. And while not every statistic is strong yet, the trend is unmistakable. Real wages are up; real retail sales are up; housing starts and permits are up; the value of the dollar is up; productivity is up; research and development spending is up; venture capital in small business is near a record. And while there's been a lot of talk about the bankruptcies which the high interest rate has brought on—and it did—there is now a figure of business starts—new businesses coming on line, that is virtually a record in our history."", ""Personal savings rates are at a 6-year high. New IRA accounts are pumping 30 to 35 billion into savings and investment for more jobs, and the stock and bond market is sharply higher. Tell me: Does all of this sound like an economy that's getting weaker or getting stronger? Confidence is being restored. You and your children can look to the future with hope again. And that's good news for America, and it's the thing that our opponents are not talking about."", ""Don't let the doomcriers and the scaremongers frighten our citizens and subvert recovery. All they offer is a return to their failed policies of the past: more big spending, more big taxing, more regulations, more meddling, and more make-work-more big government coming through the windows, underneath the door, and down the chimney. And that's an alternative we don't need. If they can't encourage, if they can't work with the rest of us, then let them get out of the way, because we're going to do it."", 'Next Tuesday, you and millions of Americans will have a moment to spend in a voting booth, the place where you have as much influence and power as any other American. As all of you prepare for that moment, I urge you to consider some very important questions. Ask yourselves: Will we create more jobs by returning to the policies that sent interest rates up to 21 1/2? Will we create more jobs by returning to the policies that gave us back-to-back double-digit inflation for 2 years? Will we create more jobs by going back to the policies that taxed working families like millionaires? Or is there a better way?', 'Well, the program all of us worked so hard to pass, the program that is still so young but that has already brought down the spending growth, the tax rates, the inflation, and the interest rates—does that program deserve a little more time to fix the one remaining problem, unemployment, so we can put people back on the job and get this country back on its feet again? [Applause]', ""You know, another thing you're hearing in this election year is that, well, we've had our program, gave it a try, and it didn't work. Well, my friends, yes, we've been there 21 months, but the program didn't start going into effect until 13 months ago. And there are still further installments of it to come next year, as I told you. I urge you, when you vote next Tuesday, vote for your hopes, not your fears. Vote for your children's future, not for the return of a failed past. Vote for the real hope of Wyoming: Malcolm Wallop, Dick Cheney, Warren Morton, and your statewide candidates."", 'There\'s a passage in the Psalms which says, ""Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning."" Well, America\'s endured a long and terrible night of economic hardship. But now we\'re entering a new season of hope—genuine hope which springs from the vitality of the American spirit.', 'Before I go, I\'d like to read you just some lines from a letter I received from a Wyoming mother not too many miles from here. Her son had written an essay, ""What America Means to Me."" And in the essay the young man said, ""I\'m glad that I\'m a citizen of the United States. I should help this country in any way I can. I think America is the best country in the world to live in; America has very good standards so that you and I can live in peace."" Those are only a few of the lines the young man wrote. But I think we all get the general idea of his essay.', 'Well, with your continued help, with your determination, and with the mighty force of your prayers, I know that we can live up to those standards. And I know, too, that a great new season of hope will bring the better world that we owe to our children-children like that young lad who wrote that essay—and one day to their children.', ""I thank you for your support. I thank you for your courage. Thank you for being Americans. Send these people back to Washington—Malcolm Wallop, Dick Cheney. And I know that Warren Morton and these State candidates should go back to your State capital. I know, of course, that Alan Simpson is going definitely back to Washington, not being in this election. But we need them all there. We need your continued support, and then we'll do the job together, I guarantee you.And God bless you all. Thank you.""]"
12,Ronald Reagan ,"October 28, 1982","['Thank you very much. It\'s great to be back in Montana and at Charles M. Russell High School again. I have to be honest with you, though. Some of my hard-working aides recommended against leaving the Capital and coming all the way out here. So, to keep them happy, I decided, I said, ""Okay, we\'ll flip a coin to decide whether to visit your beautiful State or stay in Washington."" And you know something? I had to flip 14 times before it came out right. So, then I got them all together, and I said, ""Boys, we\'re going where the people think big and the sky\'s the limit."" You know what I meant; they didn\'t. They all headed for Tip O\'Neill\'s office. [Laughter]', ""But it's all so wonderful again to see the incredible beauty of this State and of the wilderness, and I don't feel so bad now about where we're sending Tip and the Democrats next Tuesday."", ""Besides getting to come to Montana, there are some other advantages to being President. On the way out here I told Air Force One's pilot to fly low over Mount Rushmore. I just wanted to see if they were adding any new faces. [Laughter]"", ""Seriously, though, it really is refreshing to see the Rockies again. You know, we don't have anything like that in Washington. We have one mountain. The big spenders have been working on it for 40 years. It's called the national debt. [Laughter]"", ""But our incredible national debt and what led to it is one major reason why I'm here today. We're approaching an election that is every bit as crucial as the election of 1980. Americans remember all too well the days of double-digit inflation, skyrocketing interest rates, the days of hostages in Iran and the national malaise, the days of leadership in Washington that blamed you, the people, for their mistakes. Now, none of us wants to return to those days. But make no mistake: The decisions made by Americans next Tuesday and throughout this decade will determine whether we stay the course and maintain our national renewal or whether we stagger off on one more economic binge—a binge that we and our children would have to pay for. And we'd pay for it with another pounding hangover."", ""Take that mountainous debt as an example. Today it stands at more than a trillion dollars, that the Government will spend this year just in interest payments on the debt. That's as much as it took to run the whole Federal Government only 20 years ago. But our trillion-dollar debt is only one small part of the chaos, confusion, and all-purpose mess left us by the failed policies of the past. Farmers, miners, housewives, and small businessmen are still paying dearly for these mistakes."", 'Remember when inflation was in double digits for 2 years in a row? Remember when interest rates hit 21 1/2 percent? Can you remember when the growth in the gross national product had gone down for the third year in a row, and the money supply had increased by 13 percent in the last half of 1980—the highest rate in postwar history? Remember when unemployment was already a serious problem, business failures were increasing, and a recession was on its way that would hit us with hurricane force—a recession that was the legacy from all those years of boom and bust, of wild spending, erratic monetary policy, and of tax and tax, and spend and spend, and borrow and borrow?', ""Now, I'll admit that these statistics aren't at the fingertips of every American. But I do know that in their own quiet way, Americans fully understand the mess we inherited in 1980 and the obstacles we faced in trying to straighten it out."", 'And what a job we did face 21 months ago. In the last 10 years, Federal spending had tripled. In the last 5 years, Federal taxes had doubled. In 1980 alone, Federal spending had gone up 17 percent. The budget for the Department of Health and Human Services, the one that does all the charity programs and so forth, had become the third largest budget in the world, just after the national budgets of the United States—the total budget—and of the Soviet Union.', 'Those automatic spending programs we call ""entitlements"" were completely out of control. Those are the programs that the Congress doesn\'t have to change them every year. They\'re there with automatic increases built in. The food stamp program alone had grown in 15 years from $65 million to $11.3 billion—an increase of more than 16,000 percent.', ""Well, on Inaugural day, just minutes after I took the oath of office, I went back into the Capitol and I signed a memorandum-without even taking my coat off before I did it—that put a freeze on Federal hiring. In the next three and a—or a year and three-quarters, I should say, we cut the rate of growth in government spending by nearly two-thirds. We got individuals and businesses their first real tax cut in nearly 20 years and achieved the historic reform of tax indexing. That was stopping government from moving people into a higher percentage tax bracket just because they'd gotten a cost-of-living increase. We cut into the thicket of Federal regulations that were smothering economic growth, and we saved businesses and citizens at least $6 billion annually. Now, that's not a cut in the spending of government; that was a savings out in the private sector to the people who had to do all the paperwork connected with those regulations. And we reduced the number of man-hours of paperwork the citizens were performing by nearly 200 million man-hours."", ""We knew it would take time. But even though our economic recovery program has been in effect for only 13 months, the dollar is stronger than it's been in any time in 10 years. Inflation—once the number one concern of every American; double digit for 2 years—is down to 4.8 percent so far this year. And you know, it's a very interesting coincidence, because 4.8 percent was exactly what inflation was when the last Republican President, Jerry Ford, left Washington. And that 21 1/2-percent prime interest rate is all the way down to 12 percent and even in some banks 11½ percent. We're still working to bring them down further. But let's face it, we've already come a long way from that 21 1/2 percent that we inherited."", ""And you know, the source of our economic problems is even beginning to dawn on the bafflegabbers and those fancy dudes in Washington. They're finally realizing what Montanans have known for a long time: Government is too big. It spends too much of our money. You can't drink yourself sober or spend yourself rich. You can't prime the pump without pumping the prime."", ""But all these gains that we've made are now in jeopardy. Already the national leadership of the Democratic Party is talking about taking back your third-year tax cut scheduled to go into effect on July 1st and revoking the historic reform of tax indexing, which I mentioned. If they have their way, the average family of four would lose over $2,500 in tax relief over the next 5 years."", ""Now, that's why the election here in Montana is so important. We have to maintain control of the Senate. We couldn't have done what we've done if we didn't have a majority in the Senate, slim as it is. 'And we must have control of the key committees of the Senate which comes with having a majority. We have to put men and women in the House of Representatives who have a record of being part of the solution, not part of the problem.Now, I ask you, is there anyone who's fought harder against big government, anyone who's fought more eloquently against higher spending and more taxes than your own candidate for the United States Senate, Larry Williams?"", ""As head of your National Taxpayers Union, Larry has led the battle here in Montana for the tax indexing initiative and for an amendment to balance the Federal budget. Montanans aren't going to have to worry about where he's going to stand or how he's going to vote at the crucial moments in the next Congress. Now, let me tell you, he's no rubber stamp; I know that. And there are probably going to be times when Larry and I won't always agree. But I do know this: I know his personal integrity and his conscience will always be his guide. I need Larry Williams; Montana needs him; the country needs him. We need a proven fighter in the battle to get government off our backs, out of our pockets, and back to the standards of excellence once envisioned by the Founding Fathers."", 'And I especially want to address some remarks today to those voters in Anaconda and Butte and the other towns around this State, many of them miners and traditional Democrats. This is their chance to send a message to the national leadership of the Democratic Party. This is their chance to tell them, ""Leave the tax cut alone, stop stonewalling the balanced budget amendment and the school prayer amendment, and stop bottling up those legal reforms that would crack down on professional criminals."" This is your chance and their chance to tell the national leadership of the Democratic Party, ""Quit bowing to the liberals in the grandstand and quit playing deep left field."" This is their chance to tell them, ""We\'ve had enough of warmed-over McGovernism, we\'re voting Republican this year not because we\'ve left the Democratic Party, but because under the present leadership the Democratic Party has left them.""', ""And I say that as someone who's spent more than two-thirds of his life as a member and a worker in the Democratic Party, and I just couldn't follow the leadership any longer when it took the turning it took and the path that it has taken in these recent years."", ""Now, just let me add something right now that I hope all voters from all parties in this State know: There isn't a single Congressman who's done more to help not just this district and State, but the entire country in the areas of agriculture, defense, and controlling big government—not one-more than Ron Marienee. We need Ron back in the House. And I don't have to ask you—it's apparent that I ask you for your support—but when you go out of here, start buttonholing friends and neighbors and make sure you get their support, too."", 'One other prediction for you: If we can get our message out to the Independents and the Democrats in this State, another personable and strong-minded Montanan named Bob Davies is going to steamboat with Larry and Ron right into the next Congress.', ""Now, let me insert just one thing. It's a kind of warning. I can predict that in these last few days of the campaign, nationwide-and this touches on something that Larry spoke of up here a moment ago—I can predict that our opponents are going to broadcast widely one of the most dishonest canards that has ever been fostered in a political campaign. They're going to tell you that we—and I really include myself, because I'm kind of a target of that—that in some way, we're on our way to changing or reducing or doing away with social security. Now, that is sheer demagoguery, and it is an outright falsehood. I pledged back in 1980 during the campaign, and before that in the primary campaign, that social security-we all are aware has some fiscal problems that have come upon it that must be resolved to keep the program's integrity. But these problems must be solved and will be solved not at the expense of taking anything away from the people who are presently dependent on social security. And you know, I said once during the campaign: Anyone who will tell a lie about that is just like a fellow that says he enjoys a cold shower in the morning—they'll lie about other things. [Laughter]"", ""So, here are the stakes. Do we go back to tax and tax, spend and spend? Do we go back to economic stagnation at home? Do we go back to dishonor and retreat abroad as we've known it in recent years? Or do we stay the course? Do we offer hope and incentive and opportunity? Do we keep alive the beacon of faith and freedom that is the American dream?"", ""I know the answer we'll get from those of you out here in the wide country and under the big sky. I know that all of you believe in these things—the love of freedom, the belief in the basic values, the sense of daring that we've returned to Washington. It's in your very being. It's in the ground you walk on, the air you breathe, and the grandeur that you see every day."", ""Believe me, this election is important to our future. Help me, help your State, and help this country. Send Larry Williams to the Senate and Ron Marlenee and Bob Davies to Congress. And together, we can make America great again—not just for ourselves, but I'm so happy to see all these young people here, because that's what this election is all about—America great again for them."", 'Thank you, and God bless you.

The only thing I ask of Nevada is to send us another Senator just like him—Chic Hecht."", ""You know, some folks in the East don't really understand how ingrained the pioneer spirit is out here. Quitting wasn't something that our forefathers dwelled upon. And although the going was rough-sometimes the mountains were steeper and the deserts were hotter than expected-they weren't the kind of people to turn back. And that same spirit still thrives out here on the Nevada plains. On November 2d the people of Nevada, just like honest, hard-working people in the rest of the country, are going to give a message to the quitters and the Washington gloom-and-doomers. And that message is going to be: Stay the course."", ""We charted a new direction, because things were not right with our country. You know it, and I know it. And as much as some politicians want the American people to forget what it was like 2 years ago, we're not forgetting, and we won't go back."", 'Let me ask you: Does anyone here really want to go back to the double-digit inflation of 2 years ago?Audience. No!', 'The President. Does anyone want to go back to the 21 1/2-percent interest rate of 2 years ago?Audience. No!', 'The President. And does anyone want to go back to the runaway government taxing, spending, and borrowing that brought our country to the brink of disaster?Audience. No!', 'The President. Well, the Running Rebels are ready.', ""You know, when we got to Washington, this country was in the fast lane headed toward economic oblivion. The folks who'd been at the wheel were more reckless than the Dukes of Hazzard 1 — [laughter] —they'd been spending, taxing, inflating, and borrowing as if there were no tomorrow. But there was one thing different than them and the Dukes of Hazzard: The Dukes of Hazzard are funny when they do it. And there wasn't anything funny about what was going on in Washington."", '1 Television Program.', ""When you go into the voting booth on Tuesday, November the 2d, think about what's being offered. Runaway spending is finally under control. We cut an annual growth rate of—annual Federal spendings from 17 percent by almost two-thirds-down to 6 percent. You only have to listen to the opposition to know that no matter how they try to disguise it, what they're talking about is reopening the floodgates."", ""And more spending means more taxes. Taxation has been called the art of plucking the feathers without killing the bird, but before we got there the folks in Washington didn't seem to know when to stop plucking. We've put in place the first real tax cut rate—or rate tax—rate cut—it works both ways, I guess— [laughter] —in almost 20 years. And when you go into the voting booth, remember that those who oppose our program did everything in their power to stop us from cutting your taxes, and they still want to take those tax cuts away from you. They're aiming right now at the remaining installment—10 percent in the income tax that is due next July 1st—they want to cancel that."", ""And what about inflation? When we got to Washington, it was public enemy number one, running at double digits for 2 years back to back, hitting 18 percent in January of 1980. Well, for 9 months so far of 1982, it is 4.8 percent. And you know, there's an interesting coincidence about that. The last time it was 4.8 percent was when the last Republican Governor [President], Jerry Ford, was leaving Washington. They haven't gotten their hands on it yet-on the other side."", ""Now, let me tell you what that reduction means to you in inflation. If we'd let prices continue going up the way they were, keep the same rate that they had, an average family of four would now be paying $25 more a month for their groceries, and almost all of your everyday expenses would be substantially higher."", ""But what about those of you who are retired? If we had permitted inflation to continue as it was, a pensioner on a fixed income of $8,000 would now be $640 poorer in purchasing power. I don't have to tell you what that means to an older person trying to make ends meet. Because of what we've done, your pension is going farther. It buys more food and the necessities of life. Older people, as a result, are more independent."", ""Today, with inflation dropping and with the upward trend of the stock market, billions of dollars have been added to the Value of the assets of this country's pension funds, making those pensions stronger and more secure."", ""So, when you go into that voting booth, remember that those who oppose our program would return to policies that produced one of the worst inflations in the Nation's history.

Make sure that your friends and your neighbors know that that's what this election is all about.Audience member. What about jobs?"", ""The President. What we've done is lay the foundation—we'll get to jobs—what we've done is lay the foundation for solid, inflation-proof economic progress."", ""Yes, unemployment remains too high. It was too high when we got here. It'll be too high as long as there is one American who wants to work and can't find a job. But it would be no favor to the unemployed to go back to the policies that knocked the wind out of our economy in the first place. We're building a lasting recovery that will mean real and lasting jobs."", ""There are other industrial countries that have continued down that economic path that we left 21 months ago. And today they're far worse off than us, suffering both high unemployment and high inflation with little relief in sight. By contrast, America is heading into a period of growth and stability. All we need is the courage to stick with it and get the job done."", ""The positive direction of the financial markets underscores this, as does the drop in the interest rates. Rates that were going through the roof before we took office are now down to 12 percent. In fact, some banks are at 11 1/2, some at 11 3/4. And they'll soon be breathing new life—those lower interest rates—into farming, construction, and the auto industry."", ""And those telling us that our program can't work—politicians who'd rather exploit our trouble than make things better—ought to realize that they're yelling down a blind alley. Their negativism is being drowned out by the ever-building buzz of economic recovery. Real wages are up. And, in addition to real wages, retail sales are up; housing starts are up; the value of the dollar is up more than it has been in the last 10 years; productivity is up; research and development spending is up; venture capital investments in small business are at a near-record high; new IRA accounts are pumping some 30 to 35 billion dollars into savings and investment for jobs."", ""Lasting economic progress doesn't happen overnight, and in 21 months you can't cure problems that were more than 20 years in the making.

And that's why this election is so important. We're headed in the right direction, but we've got to make sure that we're not derailed before we reach our destination.

Chic Hecht will be a steady hand holding the reins, a man we can count on. Along with Peggy and Barbara, he offers Nevadans a chance to play a significant role in restoring vitality and opportunity to our country."", ""And remember, this is not a fight between Republicans and Democrats. It's a choice between those who are building a better tomorrow versus those who only 2 years ago, when they held the reins of government, were suggesting that we should lower our expectations. Do you remember those litanies, those songs they gave us that we'd have to learn to live with lower standards of living, that America's best days were behind us, we were entering an era of scarcity?"", ""And while putting our economic house in order, we've also taken the first steps to give back to the States and to the people the powers that have been usurped by Washington. It's bad enough that the Federal Government owns most of the land of your State, but in recent years it's been trying to own the people also. We want to bring government back closer to the people. And if that's going to work, we need strong leadership at the State level. And that's why I'm proud that Governor Bob List is with us today—he and these other State office candidates. He's been a source of strength and encouragement in our efforts. Back when I was Governor of California, I got into a habit of relying on Governors from Nevada.

Well, if they mean that was the sound the economy made 2 years ago when it fell off the edge and hit bottom, okay.

But our administration is a little old-fashioned. We still believe that the dollars you work so hard to earn actually belong to you, not to the Federal Government.

We're determined to find jobs for our people, to balance the budget, to protect the tax cut, and to whittle away at the national debt. There's one thing our generation must do before we leave the stage and that is not turn over to these young people that are here today that trillion-dollar debt without at least making some effort to reduce it before we go."", ""Now, no President can do all that alone. I need all the help I can get in Washington. And that brings me to the point of this visit. I count on Utah's delegation in the Congress. I'm talking about Jake Garn, Orrin Hatch, Dan Marriott, and Jim Hansen. And without them, we couldn't have made the progress that we have. Without them, America would risk a further slide to economic ruin—the return to bigger, more intrusive government, higher, more punishing taxes, growing deficits, more spending, soaring inflation, and record interest rates. Well, we've left that litany of despair behind. Together, we've turned a corner in the history of America. We've put aside the policies of fear and despair and replaced them with a program of hope."", ""Each week brings fresh evidence that our program is working and momentum for recovery is building. Yesterday, we learned that productivity increased sharply in the third quarter. This morning—I don't know whether the news has reached here yet or not, but in the East it has been announced already—Americans awoke to see another patch of blue. The leading economic indicators, which measure the vital life signs of our economy to forecast its future direction, were up in September, and that's the fifth month of increase in the last 6 months. And I might add that at the same time the 1 month out of the 6 in which those indicators were down, they readjusted and corrected, because in August they had said that the economic factors were down ninetenths of 1 percent. Well, they were only down two-tenths of 1 percent. So, the whole 6 months looks pretty good. And those are the statistics, small as they may seem, by which we indicate whether the economy is going up or going down. Pretty soon, even the diehard doom-peddlers will have to admit it: America is on her way back, and we will lead the way out of this worldwide recession."", ""America has a future of courage and hope—hope that grows brighter as more people respond to the drop in inflation, tax rates, and interest rates. We've begun to receive reports of a surge in homebuying during October that is way above normal for that particular period of the year. As mortgage rates decline, the average monthly payment for a new home has dropped by as much as $200. This makes housing affordable again for up to 4 million families. As homes are built, more jobs will be created, and you and I know that's mighty good for America. Not every statistic is strong yet, but the trend is unmistakable."", 'With all the crying today that the issues of this campaign, based on that one factor of the unemployment which is always the last to recover, what are our opponents ignoring? What are they trying to keep you from realizing? Listen to this: Real wages are up; retail sales are up; housing starts and building permits are up; the value of the dollar is up higher than it has been in 10 years; productivity is up; research and development spending are up; venture capital in small business near a record; business starts—in spite of the bankruptcies—new starts of business near a record; personal savings rate at a 6-year high; new IRA accounts pumping $30 to 35 billion into savings and investment for more jobs.', 'Tell me something, would you? Does all this really sound like an economy getting weaker, or might it just be that our economy is beginning to grow stronger every day?', ""We are doing everything we can to make a sick nation well again. But is it too much to ask those who controlled the Congress for 26 years and who spent this country to the brink of bankruptcy that they stop trying to reap political gain by preying on the people's fears? All they offer is a return to the past—more big spending, big taxing, more regulations, meddling, and make-work, more big government coming through the windows, under the door, and down the chimney, and that's something the American people don't need. If they can't at least acknowledge the truth and at least encourage, if they can't work with the rest of us, then let them get out of the way, because we're going to keep on."", ""Just 2 years ago, our critics warned that double-digit inflation was here to stay. Well, we ended double-digit inflation, and we're putting the Age of Inflation behind us."", ""One year ago—one year ago—they warned that interest rates would soar back above 20 percent, breaking all the old records. Well, they were wrong again. The prime rate, as we've told you, has been cut nearly in half, and we're not finished yet. We're going to keep it heading down."", ""One year from now they will be warning us that the recovery cannot be sustained. But with the help of your Jake Garn, Orrin Hatch, Dan Marriott, Jim Hansen, and others like them, we can give the American people something brand new—a recovery built to last, not just another cure of a recession like the seven that we've had since World War II. We can do it if we finish the job and get Federal spending under control once and for all."", 'Audience member. We love you! [Applause]', 'The President. Thank you very much. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. Believe me, I love all of you.', 'Your Senator and my friend, Orrin Hatch, is one of the leaders in our quest. He led the fight to pass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget this year. That proposal was one of the most important to pass the Senate in this Congress, but, as you know, a minority of big spenders in the House blocked it, thwarting the express wishes of the people of Utah and the overwhelming majority of Americans everywhere. The liberal House leadership claimed the balanced budget amendment was too much of a risk. Well, I think you and I should make something plain: There is no bigger risk to America or to the children we leave behind than deliberate, planned inflation that would destroy our country, and we will not permit it.', ""Key votes on issues like the balanced budget amendment show why it's so important to reelect Orrin, Jim, and Dan, and to send Howard Nielson to Washington. Utah needs them. You didn't think I was going to leave him out did you? [Laughter] No, you know your delegation in the Congress may be small, but they're scrappers. They remind me of something that Dwight Eisenhower once said: It's not the size of the dog in the fight that counts; it's the size of the fight in the dog."", ""As a people we've suffered setbacks in the past, but we've never given up when the cause was a good one for America. We aren't about to quit now. Together we can make our nation great again."", ""Please do me one favor. I know how you feel, but mobilize an army of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents between now and Tuesday. Tell the good people of Utah: Vote for your hopes, not your fears. Vote for your children's future. Vote for your children's future and not the return of a failed past. Vote for the real hope of Utah—Orrin Hatch and Dan Marriott and Jim Hansen and Howard Nielson."", ""Let me just interject something here. We've heard cries from the other side that in this time of tragic unemployment—and no one could feel worse about it than any of us and, certainly, not someone like myself and those of you who lived through the Great Depression. We know the tragedy of unemployment. But we've heard so much about, well, we should resort to more make-work programs as they have in those seven other recessions in the past—spending money for temporary jobs that don't do anything but add to the deficit and set the country back. And I think we have a better approach."", ""We have passed and are going to put into effect a job training program. It's going to be a little different than some in the past, because the Federal Government is going to work with local officials and community business and industry leaders all across the country to train the people in those communities for the jobs that are open in those communities. And even in this time of great unemployment, the need for this kind of improvement in job skills and training and spreading of job skills to newer lines of activity can be indicated by the fact that, well, just a week ago Sunday, I counted the pages of help wanted ads in the Washington Post—34 full pages of employers advertising for people to work. It doesn't mean that people were shirking and not taking those jobs. It means there were people—that we lack the skill and training and enough people to fill them. On that same day in Los Angeles, across the country, it was 52 full pages in the Los Angeles Times. And this is true of metropolitan newspapers on Sundays all over the United States."", 'Well, previous work training programs by the Government before averaged spending about 18 cents out of each dollar for training. Our program will spend 70 cents out of each dollar for actual training.', ""I thank you all for the help that you've given me and our party. With leaders like yours and with the help of the people of America and the God who watches over us all, we will secure our way of life for generations to come.Thank you, and God bless you.""]"
15,Ronald Reagan ,"October 29, 1982","['The President. Thank you very much. I thank you very much, and I thank the Senator for his very kind words, the Governor for his—[laughing]—and I may be a little previous with that, although I\'m sure—for his words of greeting. And in all the things that Senator Domenici said about the State here, he kind of left out the fact that you must be kind of a crosswords, because someone just held up a sign over there, ""Ex-Iowans,"" greeting me. When I got out of school, I became a sports announcer in Iowa, and I have just found out that over here is a lady that was in first grade in Galesburg, Illinois, when I started to school.', ""Well, I am happy to be here on behalf of New Mexico's Republican Party and all of its fine candidates for office. And right off, let me pay special thanks to Corky Morris and all the campaign workers who are going to bring us the Republican results that we need next Tuesday."", 'It feels good to be here in the land of enchantment and far away from a place of disenchantment on the banks of the Potomac. Jack, are you sure you want to go back there? [Laughter] Of course, having once been an astronaut, Jack Schmitt is probably the only one who feels at home there, because Washington is in orbit most of the time about one thing or another. [Laughter]', ""You know, when he was first elected to the Senate, he probably thought that, like E.T., 1 he had landed on another planet. He was one of the few among those alien big spenders, big taxers, who was working to bring economic order to our nation. If the entire Congress had voted like Jack, we wouldn't be in a recession now. Think of it. If only half the Members of the Congress had voted with his integrity and foresight, there wouldn't be 11 million people in our country unemployed. There wouldn't have been the double-digit inflation or crippling interest rates that caused recession. And there would have been prosperity. It seems to me that a man with that kind of perceptiveness is the kind that you want in the United States Senate."", '1 A character in the movie ""E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial.""', ""And you know, as Jack could tell us, there is something out in space that is called a black hole. And that's what this economy was falling into until we got a Republican Senate majority and turned things around. Now, Jack is one of the Senators who brought logic, common sense, and strong character to the task of making government work again. He has shown the grit and the honesty it takes to make the hard choices, to cast the tough votes. I came here to tell the people of New Mexico I need Jack Schmitt in the Senate. And I need Manuel Lujan, Joe Skeen, and Marjorie Bell Chambers in the House just as much."", ""And let me add a word about John Irick. As you know, we're working on something back there called federalism, in which we intend to restore the 10th article [amendment] of the Constitution, which means giving back to the States, to the local communities, and to the people, the powers that have been seized over the years by the Federal Government. And to do that, you need someone in charge here who knows about accepting those responsibilities. And incidentally, our plan is not one of dumping those responsibilities on the States. We intend to also provide the means to support them that have also been taken and usurped by the Federal Government. So I know that I can count on John Irick as an individual, just as the people of New Mexico can count on him."", ""But with Jack's, Manuel's, and Pete Domenici's and Joe's help, we've been cleaning away the economic wreckage that was dumped in our laps. Now, of course, you'd never believe that if you listened to our critics. They say this economy is on its knees. Well, if that's true, that's quite an improvement, because 2 years ago it was fiat on its back."", ""But I realize there is still hardship among our people. And if I thought that what we were seeking to accomplish would be only temporary, ! wouldn't ask for the American people's patience. But for the first time in our postwar history, we're trying to build a recovery that will last, not just a quick fix to see us through the next election. There have been seven previous recessions since World War II. All of those in the 26 years in which the Democrats controlled the Congress, both Houses—all of them have been treated with a quick fix. Yes, temporarily they seemed to bring an answer and then, a couple of years later, there was another recession."", ""When we took office in '81, the American economy was being cannibalized. It was being devoured by runaway Federal taxes, Federal spending, and Federal borrowing. And the result was double-digit inflation for 2 years in a row, high unemployment, a 21 1/2-percent interest rate—the highest in more than a century—nearly a mjillion-dollar debt, the largest peacetime tax burden the Americans had ever known, and government spending shooting up at an annual rate of 17 percent a year. And still the big spenders wonder why the American people want what a stubborn minority in the House of Representatives denied them—a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Well, they're going to get another chance to vote on that, because we're just going to keep pounding on the door with it until we finally get it."", ""You know, from our very first day there, we've been working to undo the economic mistakes of the past. When I finished taking the oath of office on that January Inaugural day, the first thing I did was go right back into the Capitol Building—I didn't even take off my topcoat—I sat down and signed a memorandum freezing the size of the Federal Government, that it would not increase in size."", ""You know, at my age, I didn't go to Washington to play politics as usual. [Laughter] I went there to face up to our problems, and with the support and the prayers from wonderful Americans like yourselves, we are beginning to solve them."", ""Now, I don't pretend that in 21 months we've been able to undo the damage of more than 20 years. Twenty-one months ago, we faced five immediate problems: runaway spending, double-digit inflation, catastrophic interest rates, the highest peacetime tax burden ever, and high unemployment."", ""Well, we've made dramatic gains on four of those five problems. The inflation rate that reached a high of 18 percent in January of 1980 has been cut to 4.8 percent for the first 9 months of 1982. And you know, there's something interesting about that 4.8-percent figure. The last time inflation was down to 4.8 percent was when the last Republican President was leaving office, Jerry Ford. The prime interest rate that was 21 1/2 the month I was sworn in is now down to 12 percent, and we're not finished with it yet. We've cut the growth in Federal spending by nearly two-thirds, from 17 down to 6 percent. And we will have cut your tax rates by the first of next July by 25 percent."", ""Now, that leaves unemployment, which is much too high. In homes across this country, including a home at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, unemployment is the problem on everyone's mind. Getting Americans back to work is an urgent priority for all of us, and other than keeping the peace, I have no higher priority. And just as surely as lower inflation has started the interest rates tumbling, lower interest rates will reduce unemployment."", ""Unfortunately, unemployment is always just about the last to feel a recovery. It has been in all the other seven recessions. The interest rates have to come down. People have to be able to afford mortgages again and installment payments on cars and so forth. And then as that takes place, more and more people go back to work. Well, the big difference now is that we're going to do it right. We're building a lasting, inflation-proof recovery instead of a quick political fix."", ""And make no mistake about it, America's future is a future of hope, and it grows brighter each day as more people respond to the drop in inflation, tax rates, and interest rates. That's where the trends are pointing."", ""Just today in the East—I don't know whether the news has reached here yet, but it was announced this morning in the East that again the economic indicators, that indicate whether we're dipping deeper or whether we're coming up out of it, for the fifth out of 6 months was up, continuing the climb toward prosperity. And also, interesting enough, that 1 out of 6 months, which was August, when they said that the indicators were down nine-tenths of 1 percent, they corrected that this morning and said, no, they were only down two-tenths of 1 percent in August. So, it's been a pretty good show for the whole 6 months."", ""But look at the other indicators that the opponents of these candidates are denying or refusing to recognize. Real wages are up. Retail sales are up. Housing starts are up. The value of the dollar is up higher than it has been in the last 10 years. It's the highest priced money in the world. The stock market is up—about 220-odd points in the last 10 weeks. Research and development spending is up. Business starts are near a record. Personal savings rates are at a 6-year high. And new IRA accounts are pumping some $30 to 35 billion into savings and investments that will be able to help provide jobs. Confidence is returning to America."", ""This great nation of ours is on the move again. And I say to our opponents, if they aren't ready to get on aboard and help, then tell them to get out of the way. But all we can read in what they say is they want us to return to the policies of the past. Well, I don't think the American people want to return to the policies of failure. Audience. No!"", ""The President. The policies of the past have burned to the ground; they failed. And those who would turn America back have nothing to offer except more of the same old programs that got us into this mess. So, I say let's stay the course and finish the job."", ""We've worked for a better alternative, an alternative that offers hope for the future and is already making real progress. We're on a new road now, a road that's leading America to better times. And I want you to know that we intend to stick with it and turn this economy around."", 'In Illinois the other day, I met a young lady named Stacy Hodgkins. Now, don\'t jump to conclusions, Stacy is only in the sixth grade. [Laughter] And Stacy had just won a statewide essay contest, and she was pretty imaginative, because her essay was a letter to our country. And it started, ""Dear America, I just thought I should write you a letter to let you know how great I think you are."" I\'m not going to read the entire essay, but she closed her letter to America saying, ""It really doesn\'t matter whether we\'re black or white, atheist or Christian, your doors of opportunity are always open. So knock, knock, America, here I come.""', ""Well, Stacy Hodgkins and all our young people—they're what this election is all about. What kind of an America are we going to leave them? I pray that I will see the day when we will have made some payments to reduce that trillion-dollar debt that is hanging over that young generation, and that they will know that at least we tried and we didn't want to leave it all to them."", ""Now, when you go into that voting booth next Tuesday, vote for your children. Vote for the men and women who are looking to the future and to your children's future, not to those who look to the failed policies of the past. Jack Schmitt is a man who understands the future. He's seen it out there in space, and he's seen it in your children's faces. Jack, along with all of these fine candidates—John Irick for Governor, Manuel Lujan, Joe Skeen, Marjorie Bell Chambers, all of them in the House—all of them will bring to government the responsible principles that will serve future generations."", ""Together we can make our country the source of all the dreams and opportunities that we wish for our children. And it's only fair enough, because some generations that preceded ours left us a pretty good deal to take over. We can make America what she was placed on this good Earth to provide."", 'And I can\'t close here, in this place of all, without saying something else—that with all of these economic problems we face and that we\'re trying to solve, I was asked a question many times during the campaign of 1980—because I had said that it was going to be necessary to, once again, restore the defensive capability of this country, our security in a very dangerous world—and I would be asked the question, ""Well, if it comes to a question of balancing the budget or rebuilding our defenses, which will you choose?"" And every time I said, without fail, I would have to come down on the side of the defenses of this country, because that is the prime responsibility of this nation.', ""And you know, with all those uniform caps that I saw waved there, I want to tell you something about this all-volunteer service of ours. There were people that were pessimistic and said that it couldn't work, that we'd have to use compulsion. Well, it's working. And the morale, the quality of your men and women in uniform should make every one of you proud. And that's not because we're warlike; that's because, more than anything else, we want peace. And with them we have a far better chance of keeping the peace than when we were looking helpless and unilaterally disarmed in the eyes of the world."", 'I\'d like to just tell you one little last thing about this. And it isn\'t meant to sound warlike because, as I say, I believe that it is in this way, it\'s this that has brought the Soviet Union into negotiations with two of our negotiating teams in Geneva, Switzerland, to try and reduce down—and hopefully to zero—the number of strategic weapons, nuclear weapons in the world. But I received a letter from our Ambassador to Luxembourg one day, and he said that he\'d been up on the East German frontier and visiting the 2d Armored Cavalry Regiment. And he said a young trooper followed him over to his helicopter and asked him if he thought he could get a message to me. And the Ambassador allowed as how he could, and the young fellow said, ""Will you tell him we\'re proud to be here, and we ain\'t scared o\' nothin\'.""', ""So, God bless you all, thank you for being here, and thank you. Go out there and get your fellow New Mexicans to send all of these people, all of these candidates who are up here to the statewide jobs they are seeking, to the House of Representatives. And please don't send a Senator up there who would cancel out Pete Domenici's vote. You send Jack Schmitt.Thank you.""]"

And if I can remember the way we used to do the call letters, ""Where the West begins in the State where the tall corn grows."" And it\'s good to be back with hard-working people who share an abiding love for God and family. You don\'t listen to the worldly cynics; you\'re too busy making America\'s future better.', ""It's wonderful to see so many of you here. There are almost as many of you as there are Democratic Presidential candidates. [Laughter] You know, I'm a little curious about some of the things those fellows have been saying. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, because you're closer to the situation than I am. But aren't these people who talk so much about fairness for all Americans the same ones who can't see you unless you belong to a special interest group? And don't you get a little nervous when those born-again budget balancers tell us there's only one way to reduce deficits, and it begins with raising your taxes?"", ""But let's be fair. This is one area where all our liberal friends are willing to cut spending. There is one area. They'll cut what America needs to protect her national security. Oh, they say they're for a strong national defense. But ask them if we should build the B-1 bomber or the MX missile or the Trident submarine or the cruise missile or the aircraft carriers or the M-1 tank or rebuild the battleship Iowa—but that's another story."", ""I don't know how they feel about slingshots— [laughter] —but I do know that with them in control our defenses would still be growing weaker. Oh, troops would have landed in Grenada all right; they just wouldn't have been American troops."", ""The Grenadians wouldn't have been applauding, and our American students might not have been saved. You know, I'm going to interrupt right here, because—I wasn't going to tell you this, but I have to."", 'One of our young men, a lieutenant in the Marine Corps, pilots a Cobra, was in Grenada, and then he went on to Beirut. And this young lieutenant wrote back to the Armed Forces Journal at the Pentagon. And he said that in every story about Grenada, in every paper, he read in every one of them the same line: Grenada produces more nutmeg than any other spot on Earth. And he had come to the conclusion that that was being repeated so often, it was a code. And so he wrote back to say he had broken the code.', ""Six stages. Number 1: Grenada produces more nutmeg than any other spot on Earth. Number 2: The Soviets and the Cubans are trying to take Grenada. Number 3: You cannot make good eggnog without nutmeg.

Our administration did not answer a problem of national security by slapping an unfair grain embargo on Iowa's farmers. We removed that grain embargo and began rebuilding America's defenses. And now we're doing our best to help farmers work their way back, strengthen their prices, increase their exports, and regain their reputation as reliable suppliers."", 'We can do better. But we must never shy from telling the truth. And we have some important truths to tell between now and November 6, election day 1984.', 'The first truth is the old reliable: People who live in glass houses should never throw stones. Or, to put it another way: The liberals who had total control over government but who saddled America with double-digit inflation, record interest rates, huge tax increases, too much regulation, credit controls, farm embargoes, no growth at home, weakness abroad, and phony excuses about you having a malaise are the last people who should be giving sermonettes about fairness and compassion.', ""Now, I have to say there was one thing fair about their policies. They didn't discriminate; they made everybody miserable. And now these critics say that we can do nothing right. The spending and tax cuts were too big, all their special interests have been hurt, and the recovery can't last. If pessimism was an Olympic event, they'd win a gold medal for sure."", 'You know, their attitude reminds me of a comment that a great American leader made about a similar situation. He said, ""Those who are frightened by boldness and cowed by the necessity for making decisions complain that all we have done is unnecessary and subject to great risks. Now that these people are coming out of their storm cellars, they forget that there ever was a storm."" Those words were spoken by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the fall of 1934—which brings me to the second truth we must tell between now and November: America is better off today than we were 3 years ago. We\'re better off because we\'re through placing faith in more government programs. We\'re restoring our faith in the greatest resource this nation has—the mighty spirit of free people under God.', 'It was you at the grassroots who reminded Washington that we are a government of and by and for the people, not the other way around. And it was you who said it is time to put earnings back in the hands of the people, time to put trust back in the hands of the people, time to put America back in the hands of the people.', 'And that\'s why America is moving forward with confidence again. We\'re seeing a new dawn of hope for our people. As the psalm says, ""Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning."" We\'re still not where we want to be, but look how far we\'ve come. We don\'t have 12.5-percent inflation anymore; inflation is less than 4 percent and has been for 2 years. We don\'t have interest rates over 21 percent; the prime rate is now down to 11. We don\'t have taxes doubling in 5 years; we cut everyone\'s tax rates. And next year, your taxes will be indexed so that government can no longer use inflation to profit at your expense. And we eliminated estate taxes for spouses, so that Iowa families won\'t have to sell the family farm just to pay the government a tax.', 'In 1980 we had economic stagnation; in 1984 we have a sparkling recovery that is reducing unemployment by the fastest rate in nearly 33 years. America is back.', 'But if the dream of America is to be preserved, we must not waste the genius of one mind, the strength of one body, or the spirit of one soul. We need all our people-men and women, young and old, individuals of every race—to be healthy, happy, and whole. And I assure your fine Governor and all of you here today, we must not and will not be satisfied until every person who wants to work can find work. This is our goal. And for each of the last 13 months, an average of 300,000 people a month have found jobs here in this land of ours.', ""Recovery in the farm community has been more difficult. The worldwide recession, large crops in other countries, last summer's drought, East-West tensions, and unfair trade practices have all contributed to cash flow problems for our producers, and they've made it harder for us to correct the legacy of the past. But make no mistake: We are working our way back from despair to hope. We've made a commitment to help, and we're doing our darn level best to carry it out."", ""We said we would lift the grain embargo, and we did. We said we would help restore the reputation of American farmers as reliable suppliers, and we negotiated a new long-term grain agreement with the Soviets. We promised to lift the burden of surpluses off the back of agriculture, and most surpluses have been cut. Prices are still too low, but they're stronger than they were, and this year farm costs will decline."", 'As proof of our commitment to expand exports, I recently approved a $1 billion increase for agricultural export credit guarantees in fiscal year 1984. The new total of $4 billion is almost twice what the previous administration made available in any year.', ""Let me interject some words here about a person who's been a rock of support in Washington for Iowa's farmers. He reflects the values of your people, and he represents you well. His Joint Economic Committee hearings on the next generation of agricultural policy were among the most important ever held in Congress. He's been a leader in controlling government spending and reducing taxes. He doesn't leave any doubt that he's Iowa's Senator. And if all of us work together, Roger Jepsen will be reelected as Iowa's Senator."", 'The third district of Iowa can also be proud of their Representative, Cooper Evans.', 'Audience. [Chanting] Coop! Coop! Coop!', 'The President. I must say, a moment ago you scared me when you started yelling for Coop. [Laughter] I have a little problem with one ear; I thought you were booing.

These men, along with your other Iowa Republicans—Jim Leach, who is with us today, and Tom Tauke, who will join me in Des Moines—make an important contribution to the country."", ""We had a plan to rescue this nation in 1980, and that plan is working. Now it's time to take freedom's next step, to make sure that the progress that we've made will continue—not just through the next election, but through the next generation. And once again we're the ones with the clear idea of what must be done. In the coming months we must build a great coalition of Republicans, Independents, and disenchanted Democrats around our bold vision of an opportunity society for the future."", ""Let others appeal to greed and envy, pit group against group, treat people as helpless victims, and seek to weaken our national defense. Let them promise the Moon-they'll deliver green cheese. Their first promise begins with taking back all the tax reductions that we were able to pass with your help. They're ,captives of an antigrowth, dinosaur mentality that offers nothing for the future but repeating their failures of the past. For 44 of the last 50 years they controlled both Houses of Congress. They gave us annual deficits and a national debt of nearly a trillion dollars. But far from objecting then, they said this was good for us. Well, big government wasn't good for us then, and it isn't good for us now."", 'We have a positive vision of our citizens and our country: America moving confidently forward, her people united by shared values of faith and, as the Governor said, family and work and neighborhood and peace and freedom. We seek to bring out the best in every person, because we know every man and woman carries the spark of greatness.', ""As an opportunity society begins, it begins with growth, and we know how to create it. Our tax incentives spurred this recovery, but tax increases can destroy it. We are on the side of the little taxpayers, not the big tax spenders. I consider stopping them from taking more of your earnings an economic responsibility and a moral obligation. If the big spenders get their way, they'll charge everything on your taxpayer's express card and, believe me, they never leave home without it. [Laughter]"", 'That\'s why we\'re urging needed reforms to bring greater responsibility to government spending. The Congress should stop fiddling and pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget. Do you know who first started that idea and how long ago? And he\'s been touted as a Democrat hero ever since. I don\'t think he\'d be happy with them. Thomas Jefferson in 1787, looking at the Constitution, says, ""It lacks one thing. It lacks an article preventing the government from being able to borrow.""', ""We also seek a line-item veto to prevent pork barrel projects from passing just because they're attached as amendments to important legislation. And if this Congress won't pass these reforms—and I'm excepting present company—then let's elect men and women who will."", 'Greater growth will also come from simplifying the tax code. We want to make the tax system more fair and easier to understand. And we want you to have the incentives of personal tax rates coming down, not going up. Along with these reforms, we will encourage growth by continuing to modernize our industries, expand our import markets—or export markets, I should say, and develop the new frontiers of high technology and space.', ""But America can only move forward if the foundation of our society and freedom is secure. Our families and communities must be able to live and work without fear of being mugged, robbed, and raped. We have a comprehensive crime bill that would provide long-overdue protection to law-abiding citizens. It would put an end to the liberal era of coddling criminals. The Senate with its Republican majority has passed that bill, but the House with its Democratic majority is sitting on it. Maybe it's time they felt some pressure from the grassroots. You know, you don't have to make them see the light; just make them feel the heat. [Laughter]"", ""Building an opportunity society also means providing our children the best possible education. And here, too, we're the ones with courage to call for basic reforms. Overall spending on education soared by 600 percent over two decades, but the test scores—the SAT scores—went down, down, down. So, what do our critics want? More money for more programs. What America's schools really need are tougher standards, more homework, more discipline, merit pay for teachers, and our parents finally in charge."", ""Now there's one other reform that I hope you'll help us on—an amendment making it clear that the God who loves us be welcomed back into our children's classrooms. [Applause] I thank you, because as far as I'm concerned, He never should have been expelled in the first place. And just maybe, just maybe, speaking for nationwide, if we can get God and discipline back in our schools, we could get drugs and violence out."", 'Ben Franklin asked the Constitutional Convention in 1787—and he was speaking of the Lord—he said: ""Have we now forgotten this powerful Friend? Or do we imagine we no longer need His assistance?""', ""An opportunity society, reaching for its future with confidence, sustained by faith, fair play, and a conviction that good and courageous people will flourish when they're free—this is our vision of a strong and prosperous America, at peace with itself and the world."", ""Just as America has always been synonymous with freedom, so, too, should she become the symbol of peace all over the Earth. I'm confident that we can keep faith with that mission."", ""Peace is our highest aspiration. A lasting peace must be anchored by courage, realism, and unity. We must go beyond the control of nuclear weapons to actual reductions. And my dream is to see a day when nuclear weapons will be banished from the Earth all together. We remain flexible in our bargaining. I've repeatedly stressed this to the Soviets, and we're beginning to see some positive signs. But I must make one thing plain: As Commander in Chief, I have an obligation to protect this country, and I will never allow political expediency to influence these crucial negotiations."", 'I believe with all my heart that America is more prosperous, safe, and secure today than 4 years ago. Hope has been reborn, confidence is rising, a spirit of optimism is spreading across our land. We have made a new beginning, a dramatic and far-reaching step toward a much better future.', ""I urge you: Take our message, the Republican message, to the people. Remind them where we were, what we've done, and how far, together, we can still go. You—you have always been our greatest strength. You made the difference before; you can do it' now. With your talent, your drive, and your heart, we can make history again. We can make 1984 the next great wave of a Republican renaissance. And in doing that, we can make our beloved country the source of all the dreams and opportunities she was placed on this good Earth to provide. We need only to believe in each other and in the God who has so blessed our land."", 'Thank you. God bless you all, and God bless America.']"

I know and respect your values, your love of God and family, your belief in the dignity of work, and your honest patriotism. I learned about this when I lived and worked here many years ago. And during that time I came to know and work with an Iowan who was destined to one day be called ""the conscience of the United States Congress."" His name was H.R. Gross. And long before either of us had any thought of a political career, H.R. and I worked at WHO Radio. And that was where I had, among other things, some lessons in the words—or in the economy of words.', 'One day Ed Reimers—you remember Ed Reimers—you\'re in good hands. Ed was an announcer on the staff there, and he and I were in the studio. And Ed had just done the station break. It takes about 20 seconds before you went back to the network program. And not having a commercial or anything to fill the time, he said, ""This is radio station WHO, Des Moines, Iowa."" And in a few minutes the studio door opened and our boss came in, B.J. Palmer. And he said, ""I heard the station break, Ed."" Ed said, ""Yes, B.J."" He said, ""You know, advertisers pay a lot to get their messages on the air. We should eliminate as much unnecessary conversation as we can."" And then he said, ""You don\'t need to say, \'This is.\' [Laughter] If they\'re listening, they know \'this is.\'"" [Laughter] Ed said, ""Yes, B.J."" And he says, ""And, Ed, you don\'t need \'radio station.\' That\'s all their sets can get."" [Laughter] And, again, Ed said, ""Yes, B.J."" Now he\'s down to ""WHO, Des Moines, Iowa."" And B. J. started to leave, got halfway through the door, and then turned back and over his shoulder said, ""Ed, there\'s only one Des Moines, and it\'s in Iowa."" [Laughter] From then on, we knew the station break would be, ""WHO, Des Moines.""', ""Well, in the coming election the political rhetoric is going to be pretty thick. You've had about a year of it already. Our biggest challenge as Republicans is to focus public attention on what is behind the words and promises and not get lost in the excess words."", ""The candidates in the other party have already laid out a strategy of promising everything to everybody. You've had a gang of them swimming all over the State in the past few weeks. They've got so many candidates vying for votes in today's caucuses that there haven't been enough promises to go around. [Laughter]"", ""Yes, we Republicans make promises, but not to special interest groups to be paid from the public treasury and not promises that cancel each other out, because if you keep one promise to one group you'll have to break the promise you made to another group."", 'Four years ago, the inflation monster was loose in this land, mangling the middle class, destroying the value of the lifelong savings of older Americans, and hitting the poor and minorities hard. A family on a fixed income of $10,000 at the beginning of 1979, by the end of 1980, he had lost $2,000 in purchasing power just because of that inflation. The experts were telling us it would take a decade to wring inflation out of the economy.', ""We promised to put that monster back in a cage, and that's just what we've done. We took runaway, double-digit inflation and brought it down to less than 4 percent last year, and it's been that way for 2 years now."", ""Government spending was growing at a rate of 17 percent per year when we got to Washington. We have cut that more than half. To pay for that Federal growth, the tax system we inherited was siphoning off an ever-increasing share of the people's money. The Federal tax take doubled just between 1976 and 1981."", ""We promised an across-the-board tax rate reduction. And that's exactly what we provided. We're also indexing tax rates beginning in 1985, so that government will no longer be able to make a profit from inflation at the people's expense."", ""And there's one tax reform of which I'm particularly proud. The inheritance tax had gotten to the point where it was destroying the right of hard-working people to pass their family farm or family business to their children or their widows. We were restoring that right by increasing the inheritance tax exemption for the children and eliminating it altogether for surviving spouses. As far as I'm concerned, we should never have been taxing widows like that in the first place."", 'We inherited a prime interest rate that was going through the roof at 21.5 percent when we got to Washington. We promised to bring the prime rate down.', '[At this point, the President was interrupted by a heckler. Others in the audience booed the heckler. The President then resumed speaking.]', ""Don't tell me one of the eight is here? [Laughter]"", 'We have cut that prime rate down, almost in half. And we can and must make more progress in reducing interest rates.', 'Now, we also inherited economic stagnation. Productivity was actually falling. Major industries were just hanging on with little hope in sight. We promised to turn this situation around, to reinvigorate the economy and get America moving again.', ""It's taken time to put our program in place and for it to take hold. And, my, aren't we happy we stuck to our guns? This year no Republican should hesitate asking people if they're better off than they were 4 years ago."", ""We're in the first phase of a recovery that has astounded the experts. The gross national product was up a healthy 6.2 percent last year. Unemployment is dropping sharply. Retail sales are soaring. Housing starts and auto sales are up. Last month, new housing starts were at the highest level since 1978. Productivity, after falling in the 2 years before we took office, rose 3.5 percent last year. Venture capital, which was under a billion dollars in 1980, was $4 billion last year. Because of progress in controlling inflation and our tax cuts, real take-home pay has been rising during the past 2 years after having dropped significantly in the 4 previous years."", 'This recovery is going to benefit everyone, especially the less fortunate, by creating—', '[At this point, the President was again interrupted by heckling from a section of the audience.]', 'Is there an echo in here? [Laughter]', ""By creating more jobs and providing all Americans with more opportunity, we're going to benefit everyone. And those who suggest that somehow our policies are unfair are the same ones who gave this country economic stagnation and ruinous inflation. The only thing fair about their program was that they didn't discriminate; they made everybody miserable."", ""Listen carefully when you hear screeching accusations about fairness. Just below the surface, you'll hear an appeal to greed and envy totally inconsistent with the American spirit. I predict when given the chance, the American people will choose opportunity and economic growth over greed and envy any day of the week."", ""The opposition will try to sell the American people the same old idea of Federal control and regulations, only this time it'll be packaged in a bright new box."", 'One regulation being promoted is a domestic content law, which would be interpreted by our trading partners in Japan and Europe as another restriction on international commerce. This is just the kind of tinkering that can backfire on the American farmer. We should be trying to open up markets and stimulate trade between nations, not protect special interests by throwing monkey wrenches into the works.', 'If history suggests anything, it is that government, even when directed by well-meaning individuals, usually causes more problems than it solves.', 'How many of you can remember the howls of anguish from the liberals when one of my first acts as President was to decontrol the price of oil? They ranted and raved that the consumer would be taken to the cleaners. Well, instead, by freeing the market, we unleashed a stampede of exploration. Production went up, contributing to a developing world glut of oil, and today the price of oil and gas at the pump is lower than it was 3 years ago.', 'Now, one more thing. If the inflation we inherited had continued, the price of gasoline would be $1 a gallon more than it is today, just by virtue of inflation. The cost of doing business and the price of energy are now substantially less. And that\'s what I call ""Republican fairness.""', ""Over these last 3 years we've proven that we can be trusted to keep our word. Now, we must let it be known that we're not expecting people to vote for us because of what we've done, but for what we will do. We, as Republicans, have a bold vision for the future, and unlike our opposition, it's not based on increasing government taxing, spending, regulating, or inflating. Real progress comes not from expanding the power of government, but, instead, in increasing freedom and opportunity."", ""Nowhere is this more clear than in one of America's biggest industries—agriculture. I don't have to tell you how the inflationary spiral and economic uncertainty of the last decade devastated the American farmer. The interest rates, the incredible rise in the cost of doing business, and the high taxes were bad enough. Then, to add insult to injury, your own government cut your legs out from under you by making you bear the full burden of a grain embargo against the Soviet Union."", ""Well, during the 1980 campaign, we promised to end that ill-conceived embargo. And that's another promise we kept. We went one step further. We negotiated a new long-term grain agreement with the Soviet Union that requires the Soviets to buy 50 percent more U.S. grain than they did under the old agreement."", ""These last 3 years we've been trying to keep American farmers going till they, like our economy, recover from the destructive liberal policies of the past. It's a long and arduous process. Sometimes progress comes step by step. But we've been doing our best to open new markets for our farmers and make certain they aren't undercut by unfair competition. Given open and free markets, along with stable economic conditions at home, I have faith that our farmers can produce more, sell more, and do it more efficiently than anyone else in the world."", 'You know, there are other parts of the world where farming is done on a different basis than here. And I happen to have a new hobby. I\'ve taken to collating jokes that I can confirm from defectors and refugees that are actually told by the Russian people among themselves, and that sort of display a lack of respect or some cynicism for their own government. And one of the latest that I heard had to do with a Commissar in the Soviet Union who went out to one of those state collective farms, grabbed the first worker he came to, and said, ""Comrade, are there any complaints?"" And he said, ""Oh, no, Comrade Commissar, no complaints. I\'ve never heard anyone complain."" And he said, ""Good. How are the crops? .... Oh,"" he said, ""the crops, never been better, just wonderful."" And he said, ""How about potatoes? .... Oh,"" he said, ""Comrade Commissar, if we could put the potatoes in one pile they would reach the foot of God."" And the Commissar said, ""This is the Soviet Union. There is no God."" And he said, ""That\'s all right, there are no potatoes."" [Laughter]', ""Creating stable economic conditions has been the reason that we've fought so hard to get spending and taxes under control these last few years. It's been one of the pivotal economic battles of our time. And I just want you to know how proud I've been to have Congressmen Evans, Tauke, and Leach at my side. All I have to ask is, send me more like them. And on election day, don't just go out and vote for them, tell your friends and neighbors to get out and vote for them, too."", ""And then there is Senator Jepsen, who works side by side with your other fine Republican Senator, Chuck Grassley. I don't have to tell you how important Republican control of the Senate has been to the progress we've made. We couldn't have done any of it without controlling that one House. Senator Jepsen has been a mighty force for responsible government and the farmers best friend in Washington. We couldn't have accomplished what we did without him. Senator Jepsen and his lovely wife, Dee, reflect all the good qualities for which the people of Iowa are so admired. And you should all be proud of the job he's doing as your United States Senator. He deserves all our support for reelection."", 'When you leave here, those of you who are going to your Republican caucuses, keep in mind that in a free country like ours the future will be determined not only by what we believe but by what we do. Iowans have much of which to be proud. Together, we can keep America the decent land of freedom and opportunity that God intended it to be.', ""I thank you, all of you, for what you've done and what you will do. God bless you.

18,Ronald Reagan ,"July 25, 1984","[""The President. I want to thank you for always reminding me that if you want to see where America's dreams reach toward wide open sky, where her spirit of progress is as strong as her heart is big, then come to the Southwest and come to the great State of Texas."", 'I\'ll take up where the Vice President left off on one point: At their convention, the leadership of the Democratic Party gave Texas the back of their hand. Well, we\'ve come to give you a message from our heart: We care about Texas. We care about your citizens and the values that you all live for. But rather than saying ""your,"" maybe I should be saying ""our,"" for you\'ve made me feel at least like an adopted son.', 'And you\'ve also given me and the country one of your finest. Believe me, Texas has no more loyal son than my partner, George Bush. And I use that term, ""partner,"" advisedly. With all due respect to those who have served in that office before, I don\'t believe there has ever been a Vice President that has been so involved at the very top level in all that is going on in our country and in the decisions that are being made. He is untiring, totally faithful, and I am so grateful for what he brings on the basis of his experience as a Congressman, his experience as the Director of the CIA, as our Ambassador to the United Nations, and as our representative to the Republic of China. I just happen to think he\'s the best Vice President we\'ve ever had.', ""Now, I'm also thankful for the friendship and the support of great Texans like John Connally, Bill Clements, John Tower, and Phil Gramm. They've worked with courage and common sense for growth, for stable prices, and for a strong America."", ""But, you know, when Phil Gramm tried to help us control government spending and taxing, he infuriated the national Democratic leadership. So, he did the honorable thing—he left his party. He joined ours. But then, where he didn't need to do this, having just been returned to office, he went back to the voters of his district to give them a chance to register approval or disapproval on the action he'd taken. And thank heaven—they registered approval."", ""They stuck with him then, and I'm confident that Texas will stick with him now. I'm confident that Republicans, Democrats, and Independents will join together to elect Phil Gramm your next United States Senator."", 'Now, with this talk about switching parties, I remember when I cast my first vote. I was a Democrat. And I cast it for Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932. He ran on a platform to reduce the Federal budget by 25 percent, to eliminate useless boards, commissions, agencies, and bureaus, and restore the autonomy of State and local governments that he said had been unjustly seized by the Federal Government. Ask yourselves which party could run on that platform today?', 'Audience. Republicans! Republicans! Republicans!', 'The President. Certainly not those we heard and saw in San Francisco. But then, with all respect to millions of fine, patriotic citizens who are Democrats in this country today, let us ask, were those people in San Francisco truly representative of those millions of rank-and-file Democrats across this land?', 'Audience. No!', ""The President. To those of you who are still Democrats—and I know there must be many here—and who might share my belief that government should not plunder more of our earnings, should not seize greater power over our lives, but should work to ensure the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with an orderly society, then I extend an invitation to you, and to millions of others: Come where you will be welcome and appreciated. Join George Bush and Phil Gramm and me, and together we'll make history on November 6th, 1984."", ""You know, when I heard some of the things that were being said last week in San Francisco—and I didn't watch all the convention— [laughter] —there's some punishment you just don't deserve. [Laughter] But from what I did hear, and then maybe the next day read about, I couldn't help but think that maybe the fog is so thick out there that it was getting inside their heads. [Laughter] But maybe there's another explanation. The national Democratic leadership is going so far left, they've left America."", ""I'm sorry they seem to see only misery and feel only fear and never stop pining for the days of tax and tax and spend and spend. They offer a three-point program: Fear the future, ignore the present, and forget the past."", 'And one promise that was made at that convention by one of them made me think of a suggestion I got for the income tax. It was a plan we will not adopt. It was a sample form. On one line, you put down how much you\'d earned, and on the other line it said, ""Send it."" [Laughter]', ""But they offer a three-point program—as I said—forget the future, ignore the present, and forget the past. I've found a way to put their pessimism to constructive use. It's a sure-fire diet that you can use to lose weight. And there's only one rule: You only eat on the days the pessimists say something good about America."", 'Well, permit me to make three small points of my own.', 'Point one: Those responsible for punishing America with record inflation, record interest rates, record tax increases, credit controls, farm embargoes, gas lines, no growth at home, weakness abroad, and phony excuses about malaise are the last people who should give sermonettes about misery, unfairness, and compassion.', 'Point two: Today they offer new realism. Well, forgive me, but their new realism seems to begin right where their old ideas left off: billions in new spending; higher taxes on small business, family farms, and every other working family. And we must answer with a firm unequivocal no.', 'Audience. No!', ""The President. Point three: A little barometer of discomfort that Jimmy Carter and his Vice President used in 1976. They created the misery index by adding the inflation and unemployment rates. In '76 that came to 12 1/2 percent. And they said our candidate had no right to seek reelection with a misery rate as big as 12 1/2. Well, since the Democratic leadership devoted hours in San Francisco to talk of misery, I hope I'll be pardoned for taking 10 seconds to say we cut their misery index almost in half from the 19 1/2 it was in 1980 to 10.3 today. And we'll bring it down even more if they'll just get out of the way."", ""We'll campaign on our record—and, yes, on theirs as well—and for ideas we believe will bring new hope to all Americans. We intend to represent only one special interest group—you, the people."", ""Let me pose the question they never got around to in San Francisco. Which major industrial nation today has the strongest currency; the strongest economic growth—7 1/2 percent for the last quarter—inflation of only 3—well, it's only been 3.3 percent for the last 3 months; labor force participation at an all-time high; fastest rate of job creation, as you've just been told. There are 7 million more people employed in the United States today than were working in 1980."", 'Last year there were a record 600,000 business incorporations, its fastest growth in business investment in 30 years; the largest increase in real after-tax personal income since 1973; and leadership in developing jobs and markets for the future in science and high technology, both on Earth and in outer space.', 'Well, I think you know which nation fits all of those, and the initials are U.S.A.!', ""I'm sorry the other side still doesn't know any of this, but then they never have understood the economy. They still think that GNP stands for gross national promises. [Laughter] They've never understood that incentives are the driving force of growth and human progress, that if we work or save more than before, our reward will be greater than it was, and we'll be challenged to lead more productive, worthy lives. They don't understand, but America does; and I believe that challenge will be the choice of a new generation."", ""Incentives, initiative, and innovation are sparking a revolution in America. We see it here in Austin with your great commitment to technological leadership. But we mustn't stop until we simplify the entire tax system, until we make taxes more fair, easier to understand, and most important, until we bring your personal tax rates further down; because if we bring them down enough, the underground economy will shrink, the world will beat a path to our door, and no one will be able to hold America back. So, please, don't let them bury the American dream in their graveyard of gloom and envy."", ""Endless tax increases, deeper dependency, planned protectionism, certain sacrifices, and veiled quotas—we don't need that kind of progress, do we?"", 'Audience. No!', ""The President. I've always been told that if you want to make a Texan's neck swell, you tell him where to line up and what to think. Well, this election offers the sharpest, most important choice in modern times-greater freedom or coercion."", ""Last night I asked the leadership of the Democratic Party to support six key measures for our future—legislation that will benefit all Americans, legislation that's been bottled up by a do-nothing House leadership. For example, they seek to reduce deficits, but the futile way—by raising taxes on America's families."", 'Audience. No!', ""The President. Right. I'm asking—why not do it the right way, the fair way, the effective way? Why not insist that government spend no more than government takes in? Why not insist that Speaker O'Neill permit a vote on."", 'Audience. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. I hope they're listening in Washington.

But how about a little help for the real families who sustain our neighborhoods, our churches, and our schools? The forgotten Americans in all those years of their domination have been those parents who sit around a table at night deciding how to pay their bills and put their kids through school. How about a little compassion for them, too?"", ""Then there's our bill offering incentives for investment in 75 enterprise zones that would bring jobs and growth and hope for people in inner cities and in other distressed regions.

Well, do they want to end the welfare bondage or they just want to filibuster forever about the nice things they'll do someday, somewhere, somehow, for somebody?"", ""We think it's not asking too much that Americans be able to take a walk after dark without having to cringe in fear. We have a strong anticrime proposal that would provide new restrictions on bail, tougher sentencing, and stricter enforcement of drug trafficking laws. Lives are at stake. So, if we still can't get a vote on that, maybe it's time to move some politicians out of office to get the criminals off the streets."", 'And finally, last night I asked the House to pass the equal-access bill. It would permit religious student groups the same freedom that other student groups now have to meet in public high schools in their vacant rooms during off-hours.

I believe the God who blessed this land of ours never deserved to be expelled from our schools in the first place.', ""Well, I'm pleased to give you some good news, and just received—take out your pens, members of the press— [laughter] -today I have just been informed the House of Representatives finally passed, despite stubborn resistance by its liberal leaders, the equal-access bill, 337 to 77. But let's make one thing plain: While this long-overdue action is welcome, it's certainly not sufficient. They should put their new realism to work and take action on each of those other five requests that they've bottled up for so long; and together we will make America great."", ""And let me just suggest to you the steps that we've taken, the steps we've taken to reverse years of neglecting our military security-shameful neglect—have not made America less secure; the steps we've taken have made us more secure. If the sons and daughters of this nation can risk their lives to protect our freedom in a dangerous world, then we have a moral obligation to give them, in the way of protection, the finest we can in weaponry, in machinery."", ""I want to tell you something. When you see one of those young men or women out on the street in uniform, if you haven't done it already, give them a smile and maybe ask them where they're from and tell them, maybe, you're a little grateful for what they're doing. I have to tell you that nothing in this job has made me more proud than the young men and women who are representing our country in uniform. They have the highest level of intelligence and education of any who have ever represented our country in the past in uniform. They are the best trained. They have an esprit de corps that just won't stop."", ""And I know—I was an officer once, and I know that in civilian clothes you're not supposed to salute.

Tell me, are you better off today than you were 4 years ago?', 'Audience. Yes!', 'The President. Well, all right. Let me ask another: Is America better off than she was 4 years ago? [Applause]', 'Audience. Reagan! Reagan! Reagan!', ""The President. Then I'm going to assume—I won't even ask this one—I'm just going to assume that you don't want to go back to the days of America being second best."", 'Audience. No!', ""The President.

19,Ronald Reagan ,"July 26, 1984","['The President. Senator Denton and Carroll Campbell and Paula Hawkins, thank you all very much—and for those kind words.', 'You know, a few weeks ago I was down in Alabama at a rally, and I told the people there that I\'m always happy when I\'m in the South. I guess I feel kind of at home here. The South has always given more than its share to this country, more than its share of greatness and courage. Here are the traditions, in this special place, that shaped our country, and they endure. There\'s a steadiness of purpose, a fidelity to ideals, the type of thing that made someone say, just a few years ago, that ""the South is where this country will be saved.""', ""Now, this is an interesting time in our national life. Last week the Democrats picked their nominees. The election year has begun now that both sides have their tickets. I've been in Georgia and in the South a number of times since I was elected President; I'll be back a number of times."", ""But I want you to know something. The other party apparently thinks the South just isn't important this year; it just doesn't deserve much attention. Well, I'll tell you how George Bush and I feel about the South. We won't write it off; we won't kiss it off, or try to buy it off. The South is worth fighting for; the South is worth listening to."", 'The South is America at its best. You know those folks who are writing off the South out there in the fog in San Francisco, they were busy talking and filling the air with eloquent-sounding words; as a matter of fact, big clouds of words. But a lot of those words contained what Winston Churchill called ""terminological inexactitude."" [Laughter] That\'s a nice way of saying they said a few things that weren\'t true.', ""The future, according to them, is dark and getting darker, and Americans are very unhappy. According to the other party, there's nothing to hope for but despair, and we have nothing in store but fear itself. In fact, I thought it sounded a little bit like one of those disaster or horror movies in which they picked me to play the monster. [Laughter] Do you get the feeling—I don't know whether you did or not, but do you get the feeling that they don't like me very much? [Laughter]"", 'Well, it was great dramatic rhetoric, but the fog has cleared, and this is a good time to look at the record, to look at the facts. Now, the plain truth is that 4 years ago our economy was in a shambles. Inflation, their disease, has come like a thief in the night to rob our savings, rob our earnings, and take the bread off our tables.', ""Four years ago a tyrant held our diplomats hostage. Four years ago our defense had deteriorated to the point where many of our ships couldn't leave port. Many of our aircraft were so old that they'd been flown by the fathers of the pilots who are now flying them. And 4 years ago the Soviets took the free nation of Afghanistan for their own."", 'American prestige seemed like a memory. Our standing in the world had fallen. Our government was talking about a malaise. You remember that talk, and you were the ones that were supposed to be having the malaise.', ""Well, 4 years later America is a very different place. And the Democrats are saying that it's my fault. They keep insisting that I take responsibility for it. Well, they've talked me into it. [Laughter] But I'll only take the blame if you'll join me, because we couldn't have done anything we've done without your help."", ""So, if you'll join me, I'll take the blame for inflation falling by almost two-thirds, as you've been told. And I guess that makes us responsible for the economy expanding and the country growing and building again. And it's our fault that the prime interest rate fell from that 211/2 percent, our defenses are stronger, that we cut taxes for every American so that everyone can keep more of the money they earn and spend it on their children and their families and their neighborhoods."", ""Now, you'll have to be patient with me here, because I've got a lot of admitting to do. [Laughter] 106 million Americans now have jobs. That's more than at any time in our history, and it's 7 million more jobs than were held in 1980. That's right—it's our fault. [Laughter] We've created 6.7 million new jobs in the last 18 months. That's our fault again, too."", ""Their misery index, as you've been told, was almost 20, and now it's barely half that. And I apologize. That's our fault. [Laughter] You remember the misery index. Our opponents invented it for the 1976 campaign by adding the unemployment rate and the rate of inflation. And it was 12 1/2 in '76. And they said that was disgraceful. So, in 4 years they ran it up to about 20. As a matter of fact, as of 4 years ago right now, it was 21.8. And in 3 1/2 years we've brought it down, as you've been told. It's now 10.3. And that was one thing they didn't mention—was having a misery index this year. [Laughter]"", 'You know, when you start to talk about the facts, the fog really lifts. And when the fog lifts you can see the country the way it really is.', ""Now, I'm not talking about big statistics that exist way off in the air someplace. Things are better right here in Atlanta, too. Between 1980 and 1983, total employment increased in Atlanta by almost 11 percent. By the end of the year, it is expected to have increased by 14 percent. Housing starts in your city have gone up 93 percent since 1980."", ""And our progress isn't only economic. Nationally, violent crime fell last year for the first time in a decade. And here in Atlanta, violent crime is down almost 16 percent since 1980."", ""The plain truth, the economy—or the recovery is real. It's based on commonsense fact: that if you allow the people to keep the fruits of their labor, then they'll work hard and make money and save money and invest money. They have an incentive. But kill that incentive, and you kill economic expansion. And that's precisely what the opponents would do."", ""They talk about the budget deficits. But they don't tell you that the budget problem is a spending problem. They don't tell you that all spending originates in the Congress, which has been controlled by the Democratic Party for 46 of the past 50 years."", ""They don't want to control their spending. They want to keep spending and raise your taxes so they can keep on spending. And that's what they say they'll do. And believe me, of all the promises they made, that's the one they'll deliver on if you give them a chance."", ""When they talk about austerity, they don't mean tightening Tip O'Neill's belt. [Laughter] They mean tightening yours, around your neck."", ""I want to interject something here. The other night in the press conference, I made a statement with regard to the pledge at the convention about their candidate would promise he would raise taxes. And he means it. He's never missed a vote on raising taxes. But then I gave my own position, which is that, no, we have no plans and will not raise taxes. But I added one qualifier, and it seems to be presently being distorted. And let me make it plain what I said."", 'They have suggested that I put an ""if"" in there and said, ""Well, if, you know, we get all the spending cuts that we can and still we haven\'t gotten the balance between taxes and spending together, why then we\'ll have to look at the tax."" That isn\'t what I said. What I said was, if and when we bring government spending down to where we have a government that can fulfill its responsibilities and do those things the people require of government, and then, at that bottom level, that still is above what our tax system is bringing in in revenues, yes, then we would have to look and make those two balance so that we would be spending within our means. But we\'re a long way from getting down to that bottom line of what is absolutely necessary for government\'s expenses.', ""It's kind of interesting to note that in a half dozen years before this administration came here, taxes in the United States were tripled and the deficits totaled $650 billion. Raising taxes just gives them a license to keep on with their deficit spending."", ""The plain truth is, our administration is on the right track. We've turned away from failed ideas about a huge government taking your money and redistributing it. We've moved on to ideas that work. The plain truth is that we're finally making our defense system stronger, and for only one reason, because weakness invites trouble and strength deters it. And yet, in spite of all of their rhetoric about our gigantic deficit-causing defense spending, our defense budget is lower than the one that their President in 1980 had projected for this particular time—because Presidents must project about 5 years ahead under the law as to what they think's going to happen. We're spending less than they said they were going to spend on defense and doing a better job of it."", ""The plain truth is there's a mood in this country, a general feeling that, indeed, America is a decent and a just place, and it deserves our love and fidelity."", ""There's a mood, a general feeling that patriotism isn't something to be embarrassed about, but something to be proud of. There's a mood in the country, a general feeling that once again, there's a lot to be hopeful about. Our optimism has once again been turned loose. And all of us recognize that these people who keep talking about the age of limits, are really talking about their own limitations, not America's."", ""The plain truth is, things are better. Facts are facts, and the other side is hoping that you won't look at the record. Well, we're hoping you will."", ""I couldn't be addressing a crowd in this place, and of this number, without realizing that I must be speaking to a great many Democrats who are here. But your Democrat Party has been a great party. I was a Democrat, too. And I supported and campaigned for Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, because I felt they were for a strong America, a fair and decent America that wouldn't shrink from its responsibilities in the world and wouldn't retreat or run from the challenges of the times."", 'I was a Democrat longer than I have presently been a Republican. But I think that the current leadership of the Democratic Party, the leadership that we saw last week in San Francisco—I think their instructions for getting to the convention were: Go west to San Francisco, and then turn left.', ""They've gone so far left that they've left the mainstream. And I know that those of you who still are Democrats, or who have been, I know that you've been thinking about these things, and you're aware of them, also. So, I want to put out my hand, and let you know that if you're starting to feel that your party has abandoned you, then we're holding out a hand and asking for your continuing help. We can't do it without you.From my own experience—"", 'Audience. 4 more years! 4 more years! 4 more years!', 'The President. Thank you. I give in. [Laughter]', ""My friends, we want the support of every group, of every individual in this country, and we're going to fight for it from one end of this country to the other. We're going to ask you to help us build a new America, a freer nation. We're going to barnstorm this country. We're going to get out on the stump out there, and from stump to stump, we're going to tell the plain truth. We believe in freedom. We believe in America."", 'The 1984 election will determine the course this country takes for the rest of the country [century]—as Senator Hawkins told us. This election offers the clearest choice in many years—the clearest philosophical choice, the clearest choice between principles and visions.', ""This election is about leadership. It's about what we want for our children—a free nation, or more bondage of the tax-and-tax and spend-and-spend variety, a strong nation that is deeply proud of the ideals that it presents to the world, or a nation that begs on its knees for kindness from tyrants?"", 'Audience. No!', 'The President. Right, no.', 'We want a free nation where our children can grow and become anything they want to be, or, on the other hand, those who want a tired place where a big government far away will take everything they work hard for.', 'Audience. No!', 'The President. No. I think like you.', ""We all want a great nation to be greater, a nation of free and equal Americans who stand together in the glow of fellowship and in the light of God. That's the country I'm working for, and that's the road that we want to walk down.

And I could say that for the others who've spoken here."", 'This is a special day for us, and already you\'ve given us many gifts. As we flew into Newark, we saw the lovely steeples of Elizabeth. It almost seemed that they were reaching up to say, ""Come over to see us."" And you do make us feel that welcome.', 'Along with Congressmen Rinaldo and Courter; and our outstanding candidate for the Senate, Mary Mochary; our Secretary of Labor, Ray Donovan; and reverend clergy—I have the—our great Governor, Tom Kean—and of meeting and being able to give my heartfelt thanks to your fine mayor, Tom Dunn, of being able to listen to one of the best bands in New Jersey, and maybe even in America, the Elizabeth High School Band—and, of course, meeting all of you.', 'Your devotion to your city makes me understand why you say, ""Elizabeth is a proud lady."" You know, so often when people talk of America\'s heartland, they speak of the Middle West or the Great Plains, and certainly those regions are deserving of that description. But there\'s another heartland in America—a heartland of the streets; a kind of place that welcomes tremendous numbers of people—Italians, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Portuguese, blacks, Irish, Polish-Americans, and all the others here that the mayor mentioned; the kind of a place where more than 30 languages are spoken in an excellent school system, and they\'re proud of it. It\'s the kind of place that doesn\'t subtract from America\'s strength, but adds to it by bringing us new dreams, filling us with new strength, and enriching the values, traditions, and patriotism that we share. It\'s a place like Elizabeth, New Jersey, and you be proud of what you give America.', ""You know, somewhere in the history of every American family is a person or persons who became American not by birth, but by choice. I've always believed that ours is a chosen land, that it was placed here by some divine providence, placed here between the two oceans to be sought out and found by people from every corner of the Earth, people who had a special love for freedom and the courage to uproot themselves and leave their homelands and friends and to come here to create something new in all the history of mankind, a country where man is not beholden to government; government is beholden to man."", ""These people came with their faith and their families to work and to build. They didn't come seeking streets paved with gold. They didn't come asking for welfare or some special treatment. They came for freedom and opportunity. And they seized both with such a vengeance that no matter how often they fell down, they kept picking themselves up until they could leave a better life for their loved ones. And their examples of courage, multiplied millions of times over, created the greatest success story the world has ever known."", ""But 4 years ago we knew that dream was being stolen from us. Interest rates were rising to record thresholds of pain. Inflation had come like a thief in the night—as you've already been told here today—to rob us of our earnings, our savings, and to take the bread off our tables. And all this was done, mind you, under the guise of compassion and fairness. Well, it's true that those policies were fair in one sense; they didn't discriminate. They made everybody miserable."", ""But did they have the courage to rein in a government that was growing by 17 percent a year in cost? No. In fact, they said it was your fault. Do you remember when they told you that you suffered from a malaise? They said the problem wasn't government spending too much; the problem was that you weren't being taxed enough. Well, that was nonsense then, and it's nonsense today."", 'Do you mind if I just interject something here and explain something to you? The other night on the press conference, I replied to a question that had to do with someone who has said there will be a tax if he is elected—and then said that there would be a tax even if he wasn\'t because, while I won\'t admit it, I will have to do it. Well, I responded, and I said flatly, ""I will not raise taxes."" And then I went on to explain that there could be one situation that would defeat anyone in that regard. And since then, that has been distorted, and several voices have been raised, the latest one in Washington, to say that I was really waffling and holding the door open, saying, ""Well, I won\'t raise taxes—well, I will."" No.', ""What I said was—and I think you'd all have to agree with the common sense of this—if, when we have gotten government spending in Washington down to the point that it is the lowest that it can be reduced to and still allow the government to provide the services that government is responsible for to the people of this country, and then it should turn out that the percentage to maintain that minimum level is more of the gross national product than the percentage presently being taken in taxes, obviously, you would have to readjust. But that is only if you have gotten government down to where it cannot be reduced one more penny and perform those services."", 'It was not saying that, ""Well, if I get some deductions but can\'t get all I want—"" No, if you raise taxes before you\'ve gotten government down to that point, you will never get rid of government deficits and government spending.', ""Four years ago, a tyrant held our diplomats hostage.

But the American people did.', 'And four years ago, the American people said, ""We want a new beginning."" You reminded Washington—there must be an echo in here. 1 [Laughter]', ""You reminded Washington that we're a government of, by, and for the people; not the other way around. And you said it's time to put earnings back in the hands of the people, time to put trust back in the hands of the people, and time to put America back in the hands of the people."", ""Well, now, 4 years later, America's quite a different place. And our friends out in San Francisco kept saying that it's all my fault. [Laughter] They kept demanding that we take responsibility. Well, all right, I'm ready, if you are, because we couldn't have done any of the things we did without your help."", ""Inflation has fallen from 12.6 percent in June of 1980 to under 4 percent; as a matter of fact, 3.3 percent for the last 3 months. And in that same period of time the Producers' Price Index, which indicates what the inflation rate's going to be down the road, has been zero for that period of time. But if that's what they want, okay, we'll take the responsibility for that."", ""Now America's leading the world with the most powerful economic expansion in peacetime history. Nearly 7 million jobs have been created in the last 18 or 19 months. Investment is rising at the fastest rate in 30 years. And after-tax personal income is up by the sharpest amount since 1973. It's all our fault, and we'll take the blame."", ""The misery index and the inflation rate to the—you know, you add the inflation rate to the unemployment rate. You'll remember that the previous administration, they did that in 1976. They said that Jerry Ford's misery rate, unemployment plus inflation, was 12 1/2, and that was disgraceful and that no man had a right to seek reelection with a misery rate of that size. Well, it was 20 percent the day I walked into the Oval Office, and now it's only 10.3 percent, and that's our fault, again."", 'And, yes—', 'Audience. We want Reagan! We want Reagan!

They're keeping the peace and our freedoms more secure."", ""Look around the world, in the past 4 years, not a single country has fallen to communism, and that in itself makes it a safer world.

Yet our critics in San Francisco were upset, angry, and ashamed. Well, I don't believe that our medical students who were getting an education there in the medical school in Grenada were upset to see those Army Rangers coming. And I don't believe their parents were upset to see them home safe again."", 'We had a little gathering on the South Lawn of the White House after some of our forces came back—about 400 or 500 of those students and then 40, representing the branches of the service, 40 in uniform, who had returned from Grenada, and it was so wonderful. They were all about the same age, those in uniform and the students. And to have the students—they couldn\'t keep their hands off those young people in uniform. And they came back to us and they said, ""We, once upon a time, we didn\'t feel like this, but now, they saved our lives.""', 'And they told me, one group, of how they were lying under the beds in their dormitory with the bullets coming through the building and the gunfight.

And they—these students told me the Rangers put themselves between them and where the firing was coming from, in order to get them to the helicopters. I don\'t believe the people of New Jersey are the least bit ashamed of America standing up for human freedom.', ""You know, sometimes our friends seem so upset by what we do that it makes them talk funny. One speaker in San Francisco called the economic expansion an illusion. That's right. They think prosperity is an illusion. And they think peace through strength is destabilizing.

No. Thank you very much. I'll have an answer in a minute for that, but I just wanted to tell you that despite more than 2 years of waiting, despite support from a majority of Democrats and Republicans, led by your own fighting Matt Rinaldo, the House leadership has blocked enterprise zones from coming to a vote, even though their own membership would vote for it if they would allow them to."", 'Forgive me, but I must ask them: In the name of growth, stop talking billions for dependency, and start creating enterprise zones for opportunity.', 'And now I think they deserve an answer over there.

I could tell you that 600,000 new businesses were incorporated in this country last year and how 6 1/2 million new jobs were created in the past 19 months.

In the last 4 years, 16,000 new jobs have been created here, and it's estimated that over the next 4 years another 7,000 new jobs will be added.

And we didn't set a weathervane on top of the Golden Gate Bridge before we started talking about the American family."", ""The choices this year are not just between two different personalities or between two political parties. They're between two different visions of the future, two fundamentally different ways of governing-their government of pessimism, fear, and limits, or ours of hope, confidence, and growth."", 'Their government sees people only as members of groups; ours serves all the people of America as individuals. Theirs lives in the past, seeking to apply the old and failed policies to an era that has passed them by. Ours learns from the past and strives to change by boldly charting a new course for the future. Theirs lives by promises, the bigger, the better. We offer proven, workable answers.', ""Our opponents began this campaign hoping that America has a poor memory. Well, let's take them on a little stroll down memory lane. Let's remind them of how a 4.8-percent inflation rate in 1976 became back-to-back years of double-digit inflation—the worst since World War I—punishing the poor and the elderly, young couples striving to start their new lives, and working people struggling to make ends meet."", ""Inflation was not some plague borne on the wind; it was a deliberate part of their official economic policy, needed, they said, to maintain prosperity. They didn't tell us that with it would come the highest interest rates since the Civil War. As average monthly mortgage payments more than doubled, home building nearly ground to a halt; tens of thousands of carpenters and others were thrown out of work. And who controlled both Houses of the Congress and the executive branch at that time? Not us, not us."", ""Campaigning across America in 1980, we saw evidence everywhere of industrial decline. And in rural America, farmers' costs were driven up by inflation. They were devastated by a wrongheaded grain embargo and were forced to borrow money at exorbitant interest rates just to get by.

Farmers have to fight insects, weather, and the marketplace; they shouldn't have to fight their own government."", ""The high interest rates of 1980 were not talked about in San Francisco.

The Census Bureau confirms that, because of the tax laws we inherited, the number of households at or below the poverty level paying Federal income tax more than doubled between 1980 and 1982.

No, because the rich are already in the top brackets. But those working men and women who depend on a cost-of-living adjustment just to keep abreast of inflation would find themselves pushed into higher tax brackets and wouldn't even be able to keep even with inflation because they'd be paying a higher income tax. That's bracket creep; and our opponents are for it, and we're against it."", ""It's up to us to see that all our fellow citizens understand that confiscatory taxes, costly social experiments, and economic tinkering were not just the policies of a single administration.

They declared the incumbent had no right to seek reelection with that kind of a misery index. Well, 4 years ago, in the 1980 election, they didn't mention the misery index, possibly because it was then over 20 percent. And do you know something? They won't mention it in this election either.

Well, he\'d heard that Washington cabdrivers were noted for knowing all the Washington answers, so he asked the driver about that motto. ""Oh, that,"" said the driver, ""well that\'s just bureaucrat talk. What it really means is, \'You ain\'t seen nothin\' yet.\'"" [Laughter]', ""Well, as far as we're concerned, that's America's message to the world. We've got everything before us. We're going to build an economy that you can give to your children and say that it will ensure and fulfill the lives of our next generation. We're going to go to work to break the cycles of dependency on government so that free men and women have the surging spirit of boundless opportunity. We're going to build a peace that won't fail if we don't fail. And we're going to be unafraid of exploring all that's beyond this Earth. We're going to leave—and proudly leave—sturdy and indestructible values so that in the 21st century our shield will be their shield."", ""And on this day which celebrates the productive work of men and women everywhere, let us pledge again to revere the past and to learn from it.

[Applause]"", ""You know, I've been traveling around the country quite a bit recently, and I've been noticing something—and please correct me if I'm wrong—but it does seem that Americans look happier than they looked 4 years ago when we were campaigning. You seem like people who even believe in your future again. As a matter of fact, you seem like you're better off than you were 4 years ago."", ""Now, I know that you don't want to hear about interest rates that reached their worst peak since the Civil War, back in 1980, and about double-digit inflation, or about huge, unfair tax increases on working families, growth that ground to a halt, or about the loss of freedom and steady decline of U.S. leadership abroad. So, I won't talk about those things. And believe me, our opponents don't want to talk about them either. But we want to talk about the present and the future, about what Americans are doing together, and what we must continue to do to make America great again and let the eagle soar."", ""What we've done for 21 straight months, and what we must continue to do, is create powerful economic growth while keeping the inflation monster locked in his cage. And that's how we've created what our European friends are calling the American miracle."", ""What we've done, and must continue to do, is help restore an environment in which traditional values can flourish—family, work, neighborhood, freedom, and faith in God."", ""In those values lies the heart of a good and decent people and the golden hopes of a nation as generous and peaceful as the world has ever known. We're seeing a rebirth of these values, not to return to some mythical past, but to build on strengths for a creative future as we renew the quest for excellence at all levels of our society."", ""What we've done, what we must continue to do, is keep America prepared for peace with freedom and human dignity by being prepared to deter aggression, by bringing steadiness to American foreign policy, by being prepared to pursue all possible avenues for arms reductions, by ensuring that our economic strength leads the way to greater stability through growth and human progress, and by having the spiritual strength and self-confidence to reach out to our adversaries."", ""And what we've done and must continue to do is to help push back our newest frontiers in education, high technology, and space. America has always been greatest when she dared to be great. I'm convinced we will be leaders in developing these frontiers, because the American people would rather reach for the stars than reach for excuses why we shouldn't."", ""We can forget that pack of pessimists that are roaming our land. If we strengthen incentives, invest fully in new technologies, and strive for new breakthroughs in productivity, then we can outproduce, outcompete, and outsell anybody, anytime, anywhere in the world.

The truth is, we've already got a good start, so I hope I'll be forgiven for pointing out one difference between ourselves and our opponents. We believe in high tech, not high taxes. The Silicon Valley produces some of the most advanced technology in the world. I'm told that you actually have a computer that was able to add up all the promises that have been made by the other side.

A record 600,000 business incorporations last year? The fastest rate of business investment in 40 years? Handsome productivity gains, the largest increase in real, after-tax personal income since 1973? And, yes, leadership in developing jobs and markets for the future in science and high technology, both on Earth and in outer space?', 'I figure you know which nation fits all of those, and its initials are U.S.A.!Audience. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!', ""The President. Thank you. The American people deserve all the credit for the way that you've pulled us from the depths of the economic mess that we were left with. I think the American people have trouble understanding why some people persist in distorting the facts."", ""Just night before last, a high-ranking official at the AFL-CIO was interviewed on national television. Now, it's hard for me to understand why someone in his position could be as unknowing as he seemed to be about the national employment situation. He charged that our tax program was beneficial to the rich only, and yet, even after they got all that money, there had been very little investment in production facilities to provide new jobs, so, he said, unemployment was getting worse."", ""Well, he might like to know that there are more people today than ever in our nation's history who are employed. And, as I just noted, more than 6 million new jobs have been created in less than 2 years. In the auto industry, there are nearly 150,000 more people employed than were working in that industry in 1980. As far as business and industrial investment, I just pointed out, it is at the fastest rate of any recovery since World War II."", ""Now, I wonder if he knows that a short time ago, his AFL-CIO was supportive of those who wanted to cancel the third year of our tax cut and cancel indexing. That cancellation—Audience. Boo-o-o!The President. —that would have dumped about three-quarters, 74 percent of the tax increase, on all those earning below $50,000 a year. And when he accused me of plotting to destroy the unions, does he know that I'm the only fellow that ever held this job who is a lifetime member of an AFL-CIO union? I was six times president of my union, and I led it in the first strike that it ever had to call."", ""Now, with distortions like these, our detractors would like to have you think we've made no progress."", 'You know, they remind me of a baseball rookie. He had a kind of a know-it-all manager. And it was a crucial game in the pennant race and tied up in the bottom of the ninth. And they put him in as a pinch hitter. And he boomed one way out over right center field and clear over the bleachers into the street. And, of course, by the time he rounded third and headed for the plate, he had a broad grin on his face. Got to the dugout and that manager, that know-it-all manager, was waiting for him. And the first thing he said was, ""Your stance was all wrong. You were awkward up there. You held your arms too high."" And when he paused for a breath in his criticism, the kid says, ""Yeah, but how was it for distance?"" [Laughter]', ""Today, America is moving in a new direction. For the first time since the administration of John Kennedy, the flow of earnings and power from the people to the Government is not increasing, it's going the other way—flowing from the Government back to the people. And we intend to keep on going in this new direction for a brighter future."", ""We want to enact an historic reform of tax simplification that makes the system easier to understand, fair to all, and that can bring everyone's tax rates further down, not up. Might we consider taking our cue from our Olympic athletes? Rather than discourage risktaking and punish success, rather than raise taxes, let's go for growth, and let's go for the gold."", ""We want to handcuff the big spenders by enacting a line-item veto and a constitutional amendment mandating that government spend no more than government takes in. Now, you know there are some that say you can't do that. Well, right here in California we have both of those here in our constitution. I used that veto more than 900 times when I was Governor here, and our budget stayed balanced. And your Governor now stands ready and is armed with that, and that's why you have surpluses and balanced budgets.Audience. Duke! Duke! Duke!"", ""The President. We're pushing for something called enterprise zones so people can get off unemployment and welfare and get the chance for decent jobs that they deserve. Our dream is to help every American climb as high as he or she can go. Now, isn't that more compassionate than keeping people down in dependency for the rest of their lives? That enterprise zones legislation is bottled up by the majority leadership in the House.Audience. Boo-o-o!"", ""The President. We think that it's time for every American to have the protection, also, of our anticrime package; time for spouses working in the home to receive the same rights for IRA's as spouses working outside the home; and time for working families who pay to send their children to parochial and independent schools—and pay their full share at the same time of taxes to support the public schools—that they should receive the simple justice of tuition tax credits."", ""Now, the trouble is our opponents treat each new idea the old-fashioned way—they spurn it, they turn it down. You know, I hate to say this, but the age factor may play a part in this election. No, not mine. It's their ideas are too old."", ""Now, the party whose nomination that I hold may be the minority party for now, but we have the majority of good and new ideas. We believe in opportunity and opportunity for all. GOP doesn't stand just for Grand Old Party, it also stands for great opportunity party. We believe that everyone deserves an even place at the starting line. And the more we encourage economic development, the more jobs that are created-jobs for young people just getting out of school, jobs for people denied opportunity in the past—the more all Americans can share in a dynamic, exciting future."", ""And let me make one thing plain today: We will not be satisfied until all Americans understand that they're welcome with us and belong with us. The Republican Party won't be complete again until more black Americans feel that it is their home again. The Republican Party won't be complete until Hispanic Americans and every individual in this country understands that we are the party of opportunity, the party of growth, the party of the future—and that party is America's party."", 'We take no one for granted.

And because of your efforts, people in this valley and throughout New York State lead fuller, freer lives. On behalf of all Americans, I thank you."", ""Traveling today, we've flown over a good part of the Empire State. New York is lovely this time of year. And I thought, looking down from that altitude, that I detected just a touch of color beginning to appear in the trees. And there were great rivers like the Susquehanna threading their way across the land. And I couldn't help thinking of those majestic towers of Manhattan, the hard-working, patriotic neighborhoods of the boroughs, and the thriving cities and towns that dot your upstate— places like Rochester, Buffalo, Syracuse and, yes, Binghamton, Vestal, Johnson City, and Endicott."", ""You know, it occurred to me that maybe the other side thinks that we'll just concede this great State of New York. Well, they're in for a little surprise. We're not conceding anything to anybody; we're in New York to win."", ""I know that this valley holds a special story—one of hardship overcome, of determination, hard work, family, and faith. And in many ways, your story is America's story."", 'It began almost a century ago, when one of the men legendary in the history of this valley, George F. Johnson, came here and established a shoe factory, the Endicott-Johnson Corporation. Soon the factory prospered, word spread all the way to Europe, and when immigrants from Poland, Russia, Czechoslovakia, Italy, and a dozen other countries reached America\'s shores, thousands of them are said to have asked the way to this valley of opportunity in the only English they knew—""Which way E.J.?""', 'They came here with few possessions, many with nothing but the clothes on their backs. And they asked only the chance to work, and work they did—long, hard hours tanning hides, cutting leather, stitching together the finished shoes. And as family helped family and neighbor helped neighbor, schools were built, houses were constructed, churches and synagogues were established. And this valley became home to some of the proudest communities in our nation, towns that had seen firsthand all that free men and women can accomplish.', 'In time, however, the shoe business changed. The factories in town began to offer fewer jobs, and some feared that prosperity would leave this good valley forever. Yet one group of men and women had a great vision, a vision to bring this valley prosperity it had never before dreamed possible, a vision to launch a revolution that would change the world.', ""Their leader was Thomas Watson, Sr. He had grown up in a small town called Painted Post, down the road from here, where he learned how to stick with a job until it's finished. Watson started with a company whose mainstays were punch card machines and time clocks. And in 1953—a long time ago for some of you, but just the other day for some of us— [laughter] —the company that Watson had renamed IBM began making the first mass-produced commercial computer in history—the 650—less than a half a mile from this spot."", ""Scores of the IBM workers were sons and daughters of immigrants who had worked in the shoe factories. When they began, the best market researcher predicted that fewer than 1,000 computers would be sold in the entire 20th century. Well, IBM's first model sold almost twice that number in just 5 years, and now there are IBM plants in Endicott and around the world. And the computer revolution that so many of you helped to start promises to change life on Earth more profoundly than the Industrial Revolution of a century ago."", 'Already, computers have made possible dazzling medical breakthroughs that will enable us all to live longer, healthier, and fuller lives. Computers are helping to make our basic industries, like steel and autos, more efficient and better able to compete in the world market. And computers manufactured at IBM Owego—where some of you work—guide our space shuttles on their historic missions. You are the people who are making America a rocket of hope, shooting to the stars.', ""Today, firms in this valley make not only computers but flight simulators, aircraft parts, and a host of other sophisticated products. The shoe business has adjusted to the economic conditions and is working again. Your schools are better than ever. Your neighborhoods are strong. You still have a vigorous sense of ethnic pride. You can't talk to Mayor Corino for long without feeling how proud she is to be an Italian American. And here, you carry a sense of civic loyalty that shows up in organizations like the Tri-Cities Opera and the Roberson Center. I know how proud you all must be to live here. You've shown me that. And I just have to believe that the lesson of this valley is a lesson for our entire nation: With opportunity, there's no limit to what Americans can achieve."", 'Opportunity, the chance to work hard and make our dreams come true—this is just what our administration is laboring to provide.', ""You know, in 5 years, taxes doubled, average monthly mortgage payments more than doubled, and the real after-tax income of the average American actually began to decline. Our opponents preach a great deal about fairness. Well, it's true, their policies were fair in one respect: They didn't discriminate; they made everybody miserable."", ""Now, we could go on, but we don't want to talk about their failures, do we? I can assure you, they don't. Well, then, let's talk about how, by working together, we're achieving great successes today, and we'll go on to build an even greater nation tomorrow."", ""On the economic front, we've knocked inflation down from 12.4 to 4.1 percent.

It was awfully cold then, but your warmth made up for it. And I remember that day that I talked about the problems of the time—inflation, the energy crisis, and high taxes.', ""Well, that was 4 years ago, and since then, all of us together have managed to do something about those problems, haven't we? [Applause] Four years ago, unemployment in Waterbury was over 9 percent, and now it's way below 6. In the last 4 years, Waterbury has created almost 5,000 new jobs."", ""Across the country, take-home pay is up, and families have more to spend. And retail sales are up, and industrial production is up. So much is up that I hate to give you the downers: The tax rates are down; inflation is down; so is the prime interest rate, which by 1980 had reached the highest level since the Civil War. I guess that's what the other side means when they say there's a down side to the Reagan recovery. [Laughter] But let me correct something that has been misnamed, misnamed the Reagan recovery. It's the American recovery, because you did it. All we did was get government out of your way, and now it's the American expansion."", ""So, it seems to me things are a little bit better than they were 4 years ago.

Well, it's nice to know we agree. [Laughter]"", ""But I don't think the American recovery is confined to economic matters. There's a new mood in the country these days. Uncle Sam is seeming mighty jaunty. Our brilliant and optimistic young students and scholars and workers are all the leaders in this, and our young people, particularly.

Now, 4 points doesn't sound like very much. It is just, however, the biggest increase in those scores in the last 21 years, and it's the second increase in 3 years. But it's not enough; we've got to do better."", ""So, I propose a challenge to all of us: It's time for America to lift her sights, time for us to resolve that before this decade is out we'll raise scholastic aptitude test scores nationwide. We'll make up half of all the ground that was lost over the last 20 years, which was more than 100 points. We must also reduce the dropout rate in our schools from 27 percent to 10 percent or less. And this will require a great national commitment by students, teachers, administrators and, most certainly, by American parents."", ""The challenge isn't easy but, my friends, we can meet it, just as we can continue to champion strong economic growth with greater individual opportunity."", ""We can simplify our tax system. We can make it more fair, easier to understand, so everyone in the country won't be sick with worry and confusion every April 15th when you face that complicated tax form.

[Laughter] But if we do that, if we simplify the taxes, we'll be able to push yours and everybody's income tax rates further down, not up. And with that money they're saving, Americans could spend and save and invest, and that would further boost the economy, and more jobs would be created."", ""We can pass an enterprise zones bill that would declare the older, distressed parts of cities to be special zones where business life would be encouraged through tax incentives to start up, train, and hire workers. The House Democratic leadership has bottled up that bill in committee. For 2 years, they've refused to allow the Congress to vote on it."", 'And we could add to enterprise zones a youth employment opportunity wage for teenagers, so that employers would be encouraged to hire those who are disadvantaged and, particularly, members of minority groups.', ""As Secretary Baldrige told you, we've created 6 million jobs in the last 20 months. It's a good record, better, in fact, than any other nation, but still not good enough. And I pledge to you that I won't rest until every American who wants a job can find a job."", 'So, I propose that we lift our sights toward a second challenge for America: By this time next year we must have passed enterprise zones, passed the youth opportunity wage, found ways to simplify the tax system, and all of us must go forward to make this expansion so strong that millions of jobs will be created in distressed areas where our fellow citizens need help the most. This, America can and must do.', ""There's more to be done, but we're on the right track—not only on the right track, but I think we're chugging along like a pretty big, strong locomotive."", ""But do you know what the other side would do? The other side has put up a giant stop sign to stop the economy dead in its tracks. They've come up with an idea so old, so tired, that it could very well be called a cliche. Their wonderful idea is-can you bear the suspense? Their wonderful idea is to raise your taxes again and again and again."", 'Audience. No!', ""The President. Now, I know I'm mixing metaphors here, but it seems to me the other side is so upset at the good health of the economy that they've decided to give us a dose of the medicine that made us sick. [Laughter] You know, even Waterbury never had that much brass. [Laughter] Maybe the other side just made a miscalculation. They heard the American people have a lot more moneys to spend, so they thought that we would buy anything."", 'Do we want to go back to the old days of misery, misfortune, and malaise?', 'Audience. No!', 'The President. Do we want to return to that time of taxes and timidity—that reign of error?', 'Audience. No!', ""The President. Well, I want to tell you something I've been thinking of since this morning. Over there on the balcony of the Elton one night in 1960, just as the mayor told you, young John Kennedy stood there in the darkness. It was almost 3 o'clock in the morning. His campaign was near ending, and he was exhausted. But the night was bright with lights, and they lit the faces of the tens of thousands of people below who had showed up to cheer John Kennedy on."", 'And he stood down—looked down at them. He smiled in the glow, and even though it was the fall, it seemed like springtime, those days. I see our country today, and I think it is springtime for America once again—so many new beginnings. And I think John Kennedy would be proud of you and the things you believe in, proud of the stoutness of your hearts and the vision in your soul.', ""I hope there are some members of his party here today. I don't believe it would be possible to have this big a crowd in Waterbury without having a lot of Democrats here. Well, I was a Democrat once, for a large portion of my life. And it's a funny thing about party affiliation. Whether you inherited it for generations back in your family, maybe you embraced it on your own when you were young, but it can be a very wrenching thing, I found, to change parties. You feel as if you're abandoning your past. But I tell you truly, the only abandoning I see is that the Democratic leadership has abandoned the good and decent Democrats of the J.F.K., F.D.R., and Harry Truman tradition—people who believe in the interests of working people, who are not ashamed or afraid of America standing up for freedom in the world."", ""And if you see it as I do, I have to tell you, join us. And by us, I hope you'll join John Rowland and Larry Denardis and Hershel Klein, Roberta Coontz, Stewart McKinney, and Nancy Johnson. Don't think, any of you, that you don't have a political home. You will listen to the arguments and issues in this campaign, and I think by the end you may decide your home is with us. And I hope you do. And believe me, you will be welcomed. I hope you'll walk with us down the new path of hope and opportunity."", 'And now I\'m supposed to end my speech, but I don\'t want to go. Can I stay just long enough to add one more thing? [Applause] It\'s something I\'ve been thinking about a great deal lately. I have to tell you that nothing, and I mean nothing, has made me prouder the past, almost-4 years than the young people who are serving our country in uniform. By any measure, they\'re just the best. You know, someone back in World War II asked General George Marshall what was the secret of America\'s success, what was our secret weapon in that war. And General Marshall said, ""The best damn kids in the world.""', 'Well, those young men and women are serving today are the grandsons granddaughters of those heroes of World"" War II. And I\'ll tell you, they\'re still the best damn kids in the world. Maybe when you, now and then, see one of them walking along the street, you might just go out of your way to nod or smile or say hello, and let them know how all of us feel about them.', 'And now, I do have to go, but it was, believe me, wonderful to be here. Can I come back again?', 'Audience. Yes! 4 more years! 4 more years! 4 more years!', 'The President. Thank you.', 'Audience. 4 more years! 4 more years! 4 more years!', ""The President. Thank you very much. I do have to go, but it's wonderful to be here. I'd love to see you all again. Waterbury's made a real difference in my campaign, just as it did in John Kennedy's, and I will always remember."", 'Thank you. God bless you.']"

Well, your Governor has helped you create economic growth. He's helped you bring unemployment down and is helping you create one of the best educational systems in the country.

You didn't come asking for welfare or special treatment. You came for freedom and opportunity.

These moments show us that America's great because—as a French philosopher said many years ago—America is good."", ""I think there's a new feeling of patriotism in our land, a recognition that by any standard America is a decent and generous place, a force for good in the world.

America's future rests in a thousand dreams inside your hearts. It rests in the message of hope in songs of a man so many young Americans admire—New Jersey's own, Bruce Springsteen. And helping you make those dreams come true is what this job of mine is all about."", ""We hear shrill words from some who were in charge 4 years ago. But may I suggest that those who gave us double-digit inflation, record interest rates, tax increases, credit controls, farm embargoes, long lines at the gas stations, no growth at home, weakness abroad, and told us that it was our fault, that we suffered from a malaise-they're not exactly experts on the future of growth and fairness in America."", ""I will say, however, their policies were fair. They didn't discriminate; they made everybody miserable.

I'd like to ask you some questions, if I could—I know there are some young people present—some questions about a certain country.

That would be the equivalent of about $1,800 more in taxes per household, and it would ruin the growth and your opportunities for the future.For them to introduce that blueprint for bondage in Philadelphia, the very birthplace of our liberty, was a betrayal of the American people. Now, they could have introduced their tax increase in Atlantic City, but then that would have been unfair.

I have talked with our Ambassador, Reg Bartholomew, on the way out here, who, although injured himself, expressed pride on behalf of the dedicated Americans who are serving with him."", ""In this moment of anger and sorrow, our prayers are with those who are bereaved, while our commitment to the cause of peace remains firm.

Believe me, we couldn't have accomplished what we have without our majority in the Senate, and Chuck and Roger are in the front rank of that Senate majority."", 'And I had another greeting that really touched my heart here today, and that was a special greeting from 6-year-old Katie Beckett.

And today, Katie is living where she should—at home with her parents.', 'But like all America, Cedar Rapids has a story to tell. Not so many decades ago, this land around here was open prairie—rugged and unproductive. And while I mention prairie, I have to say you\'ve got a school named Prairie.

And a young lady who\'s a member of our staff, Jan Duvall—now her married name—was a part of the ""I"" in that greeting.

And then the pioneers began to settle here: Yankees, Germans, Swedes, Norwegians, and immigrants from many other nations—men and women as hardy as the land.

And before I begin the remarks that I intend to make today, let me say a few words, if I could, about the cowardly act of terrorism that we learned of early this morning. The suicide attack against our Embassy annex in East Beirut has saddened all of us, of course. It's another painful reminder of the persistent threat of terrorism in the world."", ""I've talked with our Ambassador, Reg Bartholomew, who, although injured himself, expressed pride on behalf of the dedicated Americans who were serving with him. In this moment of anger and sorrow, our prayers are with those who are bereaved, while our commitment to the cause of peace remains firm. And I'm proud, as all Americans should be proud, of the brave Americans serving our nation throughout the world in the cause of peace for people everywhere."", ""But now, we've just been visiting with your good friends in Iowa. And now, what a wonderful way to cap our day to be back with you in the Wolverine State. I can't imagine a better place to begin our Michigan campaign than right here in your all-American city—the center of the 5th District, the home of our 38th President of the United States. And you don't have to be in Grand Rapids long to understand how this town gave us someone as good—no, forgive me—as great as Jerry Ford."", ""Your spirit of hard work, your belief in each other, and your faith in the future are making Grand Rapids one of the best success stories in the Middle West. Now, I've just been out to the Westinghouse plant and seen an unbeatable combination for our future—men and women from labor and management joining together to pool their resources, and not only saving their company but developing advanced technologies to make it stronger, bigger, and better than ever before."", 'Now, some people seem to spend their time traveling back and forth across America wringing their hands in despair. Well, thank heavens for people like you—you, who rolled up your sleeves, went to work, and together have created almost 13,000 jobs for the Grand Rapids area in the last 3 years.', ""This is the brand of leadership that Jerry Ford gave America. He helped heal the Nation's spirit, he brought back our economy, he began rebuilding our defenses. And when Jerry Ford left, America was better off than before."", ""I have to tell you a little personal thing here about Jerry Ford and myself. I can begin it by saying we go back 50 years, except that we didn't know it 50 years ago. It was just that we happened then—without realizing or knowing each other—we happened to share an experience. Jerry Ford was down on the floor of the Michigan Stadium, in the center of the line down there, playing for Michigan against the University of Iowa. And I was up in the press box broadcasting that game on radio."", ""One of the greatest tragedies of our time was seeing the America that Jerry Ford made well and strong again brought to its knees by people who didn't know then-and who don't know today—what common sense and strong leadership are all about. My friends, we—"", 'Audience. 4 more years! 4 more years! 4 more years!', 'The President. All right.', 'Audience. 4 more years! 4 more years! 4 more years!', ""The President. All right. All right. I'll give in, you talked me into it."", ""Well, America made one mistake, and we paid dearly for it. Let's make sure this November 6th we don't make the same mistake all over again."", 'Four years ago, we had to cope with, as Jerry told you, the double-digit inflation nightmare and the interest rates of 21 percent and the highest peacetime tax burden in our history, zero growth, rising crime rate, scholastic aptitude test scores that had been falling for two decades, a foreign policy as feeble as it was fearful, and to top it off, the people in Washington whose only answer was, ""All of you suffer from a malaise."" Well, the American people didn\'t suffer from any malaise; they suffered from leaders who denied them opportunity, and opportunity is what we\'re putting back in the hands of you, the people.', ""You know, with this being football season and Michigan being a powerhouse football State, maybe you've noticed in our Nation's Capital the same thing I have: When all the last team ever did was punt, isn't it great to see America scoring touchdowns again?"", 'Unlike 4 years ago when crime rates were going up but scholastic aptitude test scores were going down, today the crime rate is going down and scholastic aptitude test scores are going up.', ""Our economy is not falling apart. Our defenses are not being neglected. America's being looked up to again as a leader for peace and freedom. And not 1 square inch of additional territory has fallen to Communist aggressors since 1981."", ""Now, Jerry Ford told you about inflation and what it's down to. We won't be satisfied until inflation is 0.0. And while here in Michigan things are looking up after a long period of hard times, we cannot and we will not be satisfied until every person in your State who wants a job can find a job."", ""But let's recognize the progress we have made. I can see there are many students in our audience here today. I heard somebody a little while ago, when I was offstage, asking you some questions. I want to ask some questions, too. I won't give the answer away by naming the country I'd like to ask about, but a little hint: It has three initials, and its first two are U.S."", 'Of all the great industrialized nations in the world, which has shown by far the strongest, most sustained economic growth?', 'Audience.

Nothing illustrates better the nature of that choice than their obsession with raising your taxes and our determination to stop them.

Just to pay for their promises in this campaign would result in the equivalent of an $1,800 tax increase for every household. Now."", 'Audience. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. I know—[ laughter]-you've had a taxpayer's revolt here in Michigan.

That's America. People paying a fairer share, but always keeping a fair share. And that's where we and the other side part company. Their first loyalty is to government; our first loyalty is to the people—all the people."", 'Audience. 4 more years!', ""The President. And that's why we have such dramatically different visions of the future. They want a new so-called trust fund for their tax increases. Well, we don't want their tax increases or their new trust fund; we want a government that trusts you.

[Laughter] Our legacy can be—"", 'Audience. 4 more years!', 'The President. —our legacy can be an American opportunity society with lower tax rates for all.

No!', ""The President. Will we let them erect their giant stop sign and bring America's economy and your families' opportunities for the future screeching to a halt? Audience. No!"", 'The President.

And by ""us,"" I also mean Guy Vander Jagt and Hal Sawyer and Mark Siljander and your fine Senatorial candidates, your candidate Jack Lousma, your other candidates for the Congress—Paul Henry and Jackie MacGregor for the House of Representatives. Come and walk with us down the new path of hope and opportunity, and together we can lift America up to meet our greatest days.', 'No army is as powerful as an idea whose time has come. In 1980, millions of Americans from all walks of life came together for the common cause of freedom. We united under a new banner for opportunity, for growth, and progress. We fought to make a new beginning. We struggled to rescue our nation. And all during those momentous days, our ranks have continued to swell.', ""Today the power of that idea has become a mighty tide for progress. And with Democrats and independents joining us in larger and larger numbers, the power of that idea can become a tidal wave for progress.

And since then, until 1980—or till 1981, they have controlled both Houses of the Congress. And now, since '81, we at last have controlled one, the Senate. And we couldn't have accomplished what we have without that one. But, oh, how far we can march if we have both Houses of the Congress subscribing to our philosophy of more freedom and opportunity for the people."", 'So, I thank all of you. Jerry Ford, I thank you.

They came with few possessions, and they asked only the chance to live and work in freedom and peace."", ""Now, many went into the countryside and began to produce the best cheese and butter and milk in the world. And many stayed right here in Milwaukee. And together, they built a town of muscle, beauty, and pride. They manufactured machinery, produced metal products of all kinds, opened breweries, and made Milwaukee one of America's biggest ports. They gave this city a distinctive flavor, adapting the customs of the old country and the old world to the new. And as they stamped their character on Milwaukee, they enriched the cultural life of all Americans."", ""Today you've shown us that Milwaukee is just as proud as ever.

Americans are working again, and America is working again."", 'Today inflation, as you were told, is down from more than 12 percent to an annual rate of about 4 percent.

And to help those who do not participate in the Farmers Home Administration programs, we will be making available $630 million in loan guarantees."", ""As the economic expansion continues, we're not going to rest until all Americans-and that means Wisconsin farmers and their families—share in the benefits."", ""My friends, our great nation has turned the corner.

And we'll keep government under control by working for a line-item veto. I had it as a Governor, 43 Governors have it; the President needs it. And then a constitutional amendment mandating that government stop spending more than government takes in."", ""A southerner named Thomas Jefferson, back shortly after the Constitution was ratified and put into place, said it had one lack. It needed a clause to prevent the Federal Government from borrowing. Jefferson was right, and it's time we recognized it."", 'Now, you might have noticed that our opponents are trying to appeal to traditional Democrats by comparing themselves to Harry Truman. Well, President Truman kept a sign on his desk that said, ""The buck stops here."" But if our opponents are elected, their sign will say, ""Your bucks stop here.""', ""Forgive me, but Harry Truman believed, with F.D.R. before him and John Kennedy after him, in strength abroad and self-reliance at home. Now, to all those Democrats here today—and I hope there are many-there would have to be, in this place. [Laughter] And I hope that you feel that under its present leadership, the Democratic Party no longer stands behind America's role in the world, that it no longer represents the working men and women. So, we say to you—and I say this as one who, for most of my adult life, was also a Democrat: Come walk with us down the new path of hope and opportunity."", 'Add your strength to ours, and all of us can build something new for America, something far better than before.

We say with no hesitation, yes, there are such things as right and wrong, and, yes, for hardened criminals preying on our society, punishment must be swift and sure. In 1980 the crime rate was rising. Well, last year, reported crime dropped 7 percent, and that's the steepest decline since 1960."", ""No crime strikes harder at the heart of America than drug smuggling, for drugs tear families apart and turn healthy, productive Americans into sick people unable even to care for themselves—men and women who often turn to robbery to pay for their habit. We've established the National Narcotics Border Interdiction System, under the superb leadership of Vice President Bush, to wage war on drugs. And today drug seizures and arrests are at record levels. I know that Coast Guard men and women stationed here in Mississippi are playing a leading role in this vital effort."", ""In a case that just took place, days ago, the Coast Guard cutter Acushnet, right here in Gulfport, came across a fishing boat that flew no proper flag. The Acushnet pulled alongside, and five Coast Guard officers went aboard. Well, the Coast Guard officers knew for certain something was wrong when they saw that all the hatches had been nailed shut. In the end, they confiscated almost 4 tons of marijuana, towed the fishing boat into Gulfport, and made six arrests. I know that you'd like to join me in thanking the officers and crew of the Acushnet for a job well done."", 'In foreign affairs, America is at peace. Since 1980 not one nation has fallen to Communist aggression, while the people of one country, Grenada, have been set free.', 'And as I look south over the Gulf, I can\'t help thinking of one troubled part of the world—Central America. Some would have us take a position of weakness in Central America or withdraw from the region altogether. They want to hang a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on our border and pretend there are o problems. But that would betray the brave people of Central America and ignore our own national interests, for if Central America falls, make no mistake about it, refugees will flood our borders.

In the two decades before we took office, our total fleet had been cut nearly in half. Well, we've turned that around. In the past 4 years, we've added 44 ships to the fleet, bringing the total to 523, and that's well on our way to our goal of 600. Now, many of the new ships have been built right here in Mississippi.

And I have to tell you something—and forgive me for using a word that you children should never use—well, none of us should—but it\'s been said that back in World War II—as a matter of fact, it is a fact that someone asked General George Marshall what was the secret of America\'s success, what was our secret weapon in World War II? And General Marshall said, ""The best damned kids in the world."" Well, the young men and women serving today are the grandsons and granddaughters of those heroes. And I\'ll tell you, he was right; they are still the best damned kids in the world.', ""Now and then on the news a commentator will be talking to one of our young people in uniform. And it's kind of struck me that so often you hear the—when the young man in uniform or woman in uniform answers, you so often the proud and lilting cadence of Charleston or Memphis or Jackson or Gulfport, Biloxi. The South was the home of patriots in 1776, when a southerner wrote our Declaration of Independence. And today, more than two centuries later, the South is the home of patriots still."", ""So, maybe when you see one of our young people in uniform walking along the street here in Gulfport or Biloxi or wherever, maybe, if you think of it, just nod and smile and say hello, and maybe let them know how all of us feel about them.

All I can say, after touring your school, is viva Texas Southmost College."", ""Well, it's great to be in Texas again, and to be here with—as I said a little earlier in different words—one of Texas' greatest contributions to economic sense in Washington, Phil Gramm, and to see this Texas spirit in action here."", 'You know, when we were in Dallas in August, there were some of our people that were driving by the Texas Stadium, where the Cowboys play, and they were remarking about the stadium and how big it was and all, and then they noticed the interesting way in which the top sort of was scooped out to let in the sunlight. And they mentioned this to a Texan who was with them. And he said, ""Sure, we do that so God can watch."" Well, we can use more of that kind of spirit.', ""Now, there are so many things I want to talk with you about today, and just one of them is how the Texas spirit is spreading throughout the Nation. In the past 3 1/2 years, as Phil was telling you, there's been a broad economic renewal in our country. The economy is expanding again, millions of jobs, as he told you, are being created; hundreds of thousands of new businesses are being incorporated. Inflation is down; interest rates are down, not down far enough, but at least they're moving in the right direction."", ""So, there's good news to report. And all of that good news is the direct result of the efforts of the American people, the efforts of all of you. It's your recovery. All we did was get the Government out of your way."", 'You know, the other day I was on a campus—a college up in Ohio, and I was taking some questions from the students. And one of them said to me, ""What do you want the American people to remember most about your Presidency?"" Well, I hope they won\'t have to be remembering soon, but— [laughter] —I was taken aback. It\'s the kind of question you don\'t often hear—and you\'re a little surprised you hadn\'t thought about it—and then I said that I just felt if they\'d remember that I gave the Government back to the people.', ""It's your government, after all, just as it's your country. And our guiding philosophy has been that you know best what's right for you. You don't need a big government in Washington to tell you what's right for you."", ""I look at all of you today, and I think of the people I met this morning as—just a little while ago here, in touring this campus. And it's just so clear that the people of Brownsville are a marvelous mixture of pride and enterprise, and you have a lot to be proud of here in your city."", 'Audience. We want Reagan! We want Reagan! We want Reagan!', 'The President. Thank you.', 'Audience. 4 more years! 4 more years! 4 more years!', ""The President. Thank you. Okay, I'm willing.

And I don't want you to think for a second that you're left out of the American renaissance."", ""Things are better in many cities in our country, but it's not enough, and we've got to do better. There are so many things left to do, so much of the future yet to be seized and shaped. But the first thing we've got to remember is that together we're on the right track."", 'John Kennedy once said that ""A rising tide lifts all boats."" Well, a rising tide of economic growth is going to lift the valley.', ""We must continue to keep forcing personal tax rates down, not up. We're going to fight for the working men and women of this country to keep a bigger share of what they earn. And as they spend it or save it, sales will go up, businesses will expand, the spirit of investment will continue to grow. Expanding businesses and new businesses will mean new jobs. And that'll mean new workers who join the work force and who pay their modest—and I underline modest—taxes. And the Government will get enough to operate. But the people—we, the people—will keep enough to flourish."", ""What I'm describing is a healthy spiral that is already growing and picking up speed like a whirlwind."", 'In contrast, there are those who say that to end poverty in America, we must go back to the old days of raising taxes again and again and again.', 'Audience. No!', 'The President. Oh, I don\'t doubt that they mean well in their own way. But their ideas are hopelessly old fashioned. They just don\'t understand that the American people are tired of the tax-and-tax and take-and-take mentality. And so, I know, are all of you. And I\'m going to be ashamed of myself in a second for what I\'m going to say. But I understand they did borrow their campaign song from your State. It\'s called, ""Deep in the Heart of Taxes."" [Laughter] Isn\'t that awful? [Laughter]', ""But our program doesn't rest only on growth. It rests on creative new ideas that'll make the future brighter for all of us—ideas like enterprise zones, in which the parts of a city that have known steady economic setbacks are revitalized by giving businesses tax incentives to go in and create jobs and opportunity. It's a great idea. And we're not going to stop fighting until enterprise zones flourish in those towns and cities that would benefit from them."", ""Incidentally, that's been before the Congress for 2 years now, and the leadership in the House of Representatives has refused to let it out of committee so they can vote on it."", ""There are ideas that we've already been able to implement. For instance, a year ago yesterday we started a real jobs program that works in partnership with private employers, determining in the local areas what are the jobs that are there available for the trained workers. And, now, there used to be a costly Federal program called CETA, and lots of its jobs were just make-work, and the people who held them didn't receive any sound training. Well, in the first 6 months of our program, the Job Training Partnership helped train 500,000 people; and its placement in jobs, its rate is over 70 percent of those that go through the training, already placed in employment. Now, that's a program that works. And it's a success not just because it involves private employers who know the marketplace. It's a success because it operates on the principle that people don't want a handout; they want some help that will enable them to operate in the world as the independent souls they want to be."", 'You know, there\'s been a lot of confusion about this word ""help."" It\'s an election year, and maybe some people think it\'s in their interest to create a little confusion. But our philosophy has always been to help people achieve prosperity by giving them back their freedom, and to help those who truly need assistance, even if it\'s only for a while, as they try to get their share of the American dream.', ""Now, here at this school, for instance, there are a number of students who are receiving some sort of Federal financial aid for their tuition, and, believe me, they're students who really need that help. And their student loans haven't been cut. In fact, we recently asked the Congress to increase to $3,000 the grant aids for the truly needy."", ""But we've also made it our policy to help only those with a clear, demonstrable need. Those who can do it on their own shouldn't be taking the money we need to help those who couldn't receive a higher education without it. And, believe me, I know whereof I speak, because a long time ago I was on a campus getting a diploma, and I had to work my way through."", ""And I will say I've never regretted it for one minute. It was back in the Great Depression, so had to do it all. But I haven't regretted it. In fact, one of the better jobs I've ever had in my life was at that time—I was washing dishes in the girls dormitory. [Laughter]"", ""Now, some of the people in this valley have really been hurt by the devaluation of the peso. And because of that, last year our administration became the first ever to set up a special southwest border initiative to give you the special attention that the border cities need. And after last winter's freeze, we directed the Farmers Home Administration to make more loans to local families without adequate housing. Now, this has encouraged new construction and employment in the valley."", 'We freed up more Federal funds for small business loans for farmers affected by the freeze. And the city of Brownsville, for example, was given funds to help build a supermarket in a deprived part of the city, and that construction is to create 43 permanent jobs and 30 construction jobs. We also provided financial assistance to help with bilingual programs in the schools of the valley.', 'Now, these are just three demonstrations of prudent Federal assistance in a case of clear and demonstrable need. In the past year alone, our administration has committed over a hundred million dollars to the valley.', 'And if I may make one more point on this: We believe passionately in public-private partnerships in this kind of assistance.', ""The money that we sent for the supermarket here in the valley was matched by $800,000 in private funds. And there's Project HOPE, another public-private partnership. Earlier I toured the labs where local students are being trained to work as health-care professionals here and in other border cities. And I know that program is going to be a great success and a great example of public and private cooperation."", ""Now, I've been talking on about the economy—something I tend to do because I think a healthy economy will truly transform the lives of the people of our country. But there's just one more thing I'd like to say about it. Sometimes it takes patience when you try something new. But I tell you, well, it's hard to hang on when times are tough. But I tell you with complete conviction, that if we stay on the right track nationally, then the people in the towns of the valley will make a comeback. It won't happen overnight, but it will happen in Brownsville as it has happened in much of the rest of the Nation."", ""But let me say in closing that even though economic matters are important-well, the old, old saying is true: Man does not live by bread alone. Man lives by belief, by faith in things that are larger than himself. We really almost diminish all the things we are when we limit the debate to money and how it's distributed in our country. We lose a sense of the mystery in men's souls and the mystery of life."", ""I'm proud that we've tried the past few years to softly encourage respect for the traditional values of faith in God and respect for the family. The family, after all, is the main generator of the good things that people bring to the society at large. We're nothing without the family, and we've tried to reflect that knowledge in all that we've done in the past few years."", 'Now, just one more thing. I know that many of you know the word—and I hope I pronounce it correctly—respeto. Respect. Did I get it right?', ""Respect is an important thing. The United States never wants to be a bully or a braggart, but it's important to show the people of the world that we stand for something and we're proud of it. And though we're patient when provoked, well, Uncle Sam is a friendly old man, but he has a spine of steel."", ""And one of the things that I'm proudest of—do any of you have relatives in the Armed Forces—the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps? Yes? Well, I'm glad to see that. One of the proudest things—or one of the things that I'm proudest of, is that we've helped the men and women of our Armed Forces receive the kind of respect they deserve."", ""Once again, they're being honored as the priceless professionals they are. They haven't had it easy. The men and women who protect this country never do. But we improved pay, improved their standard of living, and we started saluting them again. And morale is higher than it's ever been, and reenlistments are up. And I'll tell you, whenever you happen to see one of those young men and women in uniform on the street, if you just maybe give them a smile and a hello and indicate that you know how proud they make us, I think you'd feel just great after you did it, and I know they'd feel great."", ""Well, I've probably gone on too long here, but"", 'Audience. No!—', 'The President. I like it', 'Audience. 4 more years! 4 more years! 4 more years!', ""The President. Thank you. Okay, all right. Thank you. I don't get here often enough. I like it here. Can I come back? [Applause]"", 'You know, you\'re reminding me of something that I saw yesterday. I went to a swearing-in ceremony for 1,548 new citizens, all being sworn in as new citizens of the United States. And it was wonderful, and it was a very moving experience. The oldest of them was 92, and the youngest was only 2. And as they took the Pledge of Allegiance for the first time, they spoke with such a belief, and I thought that this is still—and will be hearing them always-""... one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all.""', 'For that we must all be truly thankful, and I thank you so much for your wonderful hospitality.

Well, I think he's a little confused. Doesn't he know you don't want greater taxes, you want a greater Texas?"", ""Raising taxes will not encourage people in Texas to work harder and be more productive; raising taxes will not stimulate investment; raising taxes will not give business the incentive to innovate and to make their companies more competitive. America doesn't need higher taxes. America doesn't need my opponent to rescue us from prosperity. America needs more growth."", ""Those who still need help will get help, and every American who wants a job will find a job as we keep on growing.

And those people claimed that our program wouldn't work. They said it wouldn't work before it had even been passed. And incidentally, when you meet somebody that maybe wonders why you're supporting Phil Gramm, you might remind him that one of the two names on the legislation that brought about the tax cuts and the economic progress and the reduction in government spending—the names were Del Latta and Phil Gramm. It was their bill."", ""Those same people warned us that cutting tax rates would lead to super inflation. Well, now that our economy is strong and growing, they're a little stuck, so they tell us now, it won't last.

Of course, when one is so tied to the politics of the past and focusing on the negative, it's hard to have a vision of a better future."", ""But I don't know, I see America as a soaring eagle—strong, proud, and free.

So many of us started out in a country where we knew no matter how beset we were with poverty or what seemed to be lack of opportunity or anything, we knew that anything was possible in this country of ours.

No!', ""The President. Well, we've already seen what happens when we follow the policies that our opponents have so faithfully promised to restore—the failed policies of tax-and-tax and spend-and-spend.

And I don't care what was said tonight or out on the road in the campaign trail, this country was in an economic mess of enormous proportions in 1980."", 'They talk about fairness, but what could be more unfair than that punishing inflation that could take people down through the brackets of poverty simply by raising the prices of things and lowering the value of the money that they had?', 'We saw those interest rates, as I mentioned in the debate—21 1/2 percent. And that closed down the housing industry, that closed down the automobile industry, both of which are dependent on credit buying, mortgage buying.', ""Then we saw the rising unemployment.

And that's the difference between now and 1980."", 'Now, I didn\'t get a chance to reply tonight to all of those frequent references to an arms race. Well, you know, there was a cartoon back when we first started the rebuilding of the military that said it all for me. It was a picture of a couple of Russian generals talking to each other, and one of them said, ""I liked it better when we were the only ones in the arms race."" [Laughter] We\'re going to get them back to the table to talk disarmament. I don\'t mean arms limitations.', ""You know, some of the previous treaties that we've had I know were in good faith and all that, but all they did was set the rules for the continued arms race. When I got there, found out that SALT II, from the time that it was signed until I arrived in Washington—an expert in the field gave me the information that under the signing of SALT II, without breaking the treaty, the Soviet Union had added to their nuclear arsenal the equivalent of the bomb we dropped on Hiroshima. They had added that every 11 minutes in the years since the treaty had been signed."", ""Well, that isn't what we want.

And it didn't come from any multi-billion-dollar Federal program."", 'Yes, we appointed a commission, the best people we could find, and said, ""Come back and tell us, what should we do about education in this country?"" They did. And we passed it on to you, to the people in the communities, the people in the school districts, to the teachers and the parents and the students. And all over the United States it\'s happening. There are now the compulsory courses in math and science that have been abandoned in so many places—there are the added requirements for graduation.

Now, making the economy bear the burden of our opponents tax hike would be like having some of those Olympic swimmers-their coach telling them that they had to swim while carrying an anvil— [laughter] -or a runner would sprint with a ball and chain.

And the last 4 years before we got here, they were telling us that we suffered from a malaise, that it was our fault, that we had to give up the idea of having some of the things we used to have, that there were eras of limits. Don't you believe it."", ""You young people, this is what it's all about. We're going to keep on going the path—he kept saying he didn't know what we were going to do.

And I can truthfully say, nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina in the morning.', ""Well, it's wonderful to see your enthusiasm. It's heartening, because this election is not a contest between Republicans and Democrats or between left and right; it's a contest between the future and the past. I have said on occasion that age is going to be an issue in this campaign—their ideas are just too darn old. [Laughter]"", ""But this contest is being waged for the soul of our country and the will of its people. And it's good to know where you stand, and I'm proud to stand with you. I'm a great admirer of your State—not just because the sky is Carolina blue—I was a little worried that I might not be able to say that if the clouds didn't clear, but they did; the soil is fertile; your mountains are majestic; and it's not also because I feel a special affinity for one of your main industries-you cure tobacco and I'm trying to cure economics— [laughter] —but I admire your State because I admire your people. You were the first to vote for independence. And not too many years ago, when some people were burning our flag, you were waving it. Well, like the rest of the country, I'm impressed by your independence, and because of it, I truly treasure your support."", ""Now, we could begin today talking about how the economy is recovering and expanding, about how we've created 6 million new jobs, and 600,000 businesses were incorporated last year alone—that's a record in our nation's history. But those are national statistics. Here in North Carolina, the unemployment rate 4 years ago was over 8 percent; it's now 6 1/2. Now, that's not low enough, but it's a big improvement."", ""Here in Charlotte, construction is up; take-home pay is up; sales are up. In other words, I'm in a city that I would characterize as part of the national renewal. My opponents, of course, would say it's a pocket of despair. Well, I don't know about them. They go around insisting the economy is in a shambles and people are worse off than they ever were, and they've got to come back and raise our taxes to get things good again.Audience. No!"", ""The President. Well, now, I understand their attempts to convince you that things aren't better—that's what opponents do. And faced with the irrefutable fact of our national renewal, it hasn't been very easy for them. But let's stop for a moment and remember the mess they left us and what all of us have done—all of us—to turn our nation around."", ""In the past 3 1/2 years we've cut the growth of government spending by nearly two-thirds. We have lowered personal tax rates by 25 percent for every taxpayer in the country. We cut inflation from 12.4 percent to 4.2, and we cut interest rates from 21 1/2 to 12 3/4 and, in some banks, 12 1/2."", ""Now, our opponents say the tax cuts were for millionaires. They say they weren't compassionate. But look at the record. Two-thirds of the income tax was being paid by two-thirds of the people, those under $50,000 a year. And two-thirds of the tax cut went to those same people. A typical family of four will have paid about $2,000 less in total income taxes during our administration. Our opponents would raise taxes the equivalent of almost $2,000—$1,890 per household, and that's a $157 more in taxes every month of the year. And they call that compassion."", ""Well, let's look at what their inflation did to us. When our opponents were in charge from 1976 to 1980—or through 1980—grocery bills increased by 50 percent. The price of a gallon of gas more than doubled. And in 1979 and '80, the weekly earnings of working Americans declined in real dollars, in real terms, by 8.8 percent, which was the first—or the worst drop since World War II. And the poor were hit hardest of all."", ""People on fixed incomes saw double-digit inflation kill their purchasing power. Families saw inflation make a joke out of their savings. And the truly needy who depend on government aid saw their benefits eroded by the destructive force of inflation. As a matter of fact, there were three increases during their time in the Aid for Dependent Children grant, and they still couldn't keep up. After the three increases, the people were worse off by several hundred dollars than they had been before.And do you call that compassion?Audience. No!"", ""The President. Well, we cut inflation, and I'll tell you what it means: that 8.8 percent weekly—or decline in weekly earnings-within the last 2 years, weekly earnings have increased by 3.2 percent. Four years ago the weekly food bill for a family of four was almost $87. If my opponents' inflation rates had continued, that food bill would now be almost $128. Well, instead, we've kept the family's food bill down to $98.50, roughly one-fourth the rise that their inflation would have created."", ""Their interest rates were at 21 1/2 percent the day they left office. Soaring mortgage rates meant 10 million families could no longer afford to buy homes. We cut those interest rates, and it helped reduce the average cost of home mortgages by $143 a month. It's brought home ownership within reach of 5 million more Americans, and it's made car purchases more affordable, too-but still not good enough, but far better than the mess that they left us."", 'And as we freed up the economy to grow, we created over 6 million new jobs in the last 21 months. More people are working this year than ever before in our history, and a job is the surest escape from poverty.', ""I want to stop for just a moment and say one of the things that makes us different from our opponents. We understand the need for jobs, real jobs, not make-work jobs. We don't want to keep people on welfare, keep them in bondage as wards of the state. We know that people want to work. They want to contribute. They want to be a part of society. And we don't patronize them with handouts. We give them a chance through economic growth. And that's why I will fight his tax increase proposals, and I will fight to bring everybody's tax rates further down, not up. And I'll fight so that every American who wants a job can find a job, from the Carolina shore to San Francisco Bay."", ""They favor busing that takes innocent children out of the neighborhood school and makes them pawns in a social experiment that nobody wants. We've found out it failed. I don't call that compassion. My opponent helped impose a grain embargo that punished the American farmer for his administration's foreign policy defeats. And I don't call that compassion. The other side continued heavy estate taxes on the family farm. And that is not compassion. Well, we have practically eliminated that tax so that you can keep the farm in the family, and we have eliminated the inheritance tax for a surviving spouse. And that is compassion."", ""Now, they say they're going to bring their kind of compassion back. Should we let them?Audience. No!"", ""The President. You've answered already. Yes, we should keep giving a fair break to every citizen in our country."", ""The truth is, we're on the right track. But our national renewal isn't confined to the economy. More than prosperity, we have peace. I believe that we've made the world a more stable place. We're making quiet progress toward arms control, because we've not been mislead by empty talk and false promises. We've put America in a position of sufficient strength to achieve real and meaningful reductions in nuclear arms. And we did this knowing, as Teddy Roosevelt did, that the cry of the weakling counts for a little in the move toward peace, but the call of the just man, armed, is potent."", ""But there's another peace, the peace of the family, the peace that we're given through faith, through tradition, through fidelity to ideals. Our administration has tried these past few years to softly encourage the values by which our nation has flourished. And that's why we've tried to restore the right of voluntary prayer to our schoolchildren, to give tuition tax credits for parents who want to send their children to independent schools, and to foster legislation that recognizes that the family is the prime generator of the good things young people bring to this society as a whole."", 'We haven\'t always succeeded, but we\'ll never stop trying. And the truth is we have a philosophy and a spirit of renewal whose time has come. The columnists and pundits say that in 1980 the American voters took a turn to the right. Well, I think they missed the point. The fact is that quietly, unseen, and unheard, from Maine to California, a new understanding of the word ""freedom"" has swept this continent—freedom from heavy taxation, freedom from the Big Brother mentality that says that Big Brother knows best how to run your lives, that you\'re not bright enough to run your own lives.', 'America turned away from politicians who patronize, and it wasn\'t just a shift or a turn; it was a sea change. And we\'ll keep the new freedoms born of that change, and we will continue to make America stronger with them. The other day I was asked, ""How do you want your administration to be remembered?"" Well, the first thing I thought was, well, I\'d rather that you not have to remember it anytime too soon- [laughter] —but I thought about it, and I said then—because I never thought about it before—I\'d like my Presidency to be remembered as the one that gave the Government back to the people.And because—', 'Audience. 4 more years! 4 more years! 4 more years!', ""The President. That's a good idea. I wish I'd thought of it. Oh, I don't fear the judgment of my fellow citizens on November 6th, but a fellow once told me that you can't count on victory until all the votes are counted. And I thanked President Dewey for that advice. [Laughter]"", 'In 4 weeks we must all take part in the simplest but most essential of the democratic acts—we must make time and get to the polling place and vote. A vote is an expression of will, and the leaders of the opposition have got to start to understand the breadth and depth of the will of the people.', ""And so I say to all of you who see things as we do, don't take this election for granted. Don't pay any attention to the polls. Get out there and vote and see that your neighbor and your friend on either side votes."", ""And let me say to people of all political persuasions, from Independents to disenchanted Democrats, the welcome mat is out. I know that in a crowd, in this place, of this size, there have to be many Democrats who are here because they no longer can look with approval upon the way their leaders, the leaders of their party, have been taking them and this country. Well, I was one of you. I, too, was a Democrat for much of my adult life and, let me tell you, the welcome mat is out. We hope that you can join us this year because we need you, we want your help, and we know that we can do the things we're trying to do in a bipartisan way, together, as Americans, not just members of one party or the other.Now, I hope to win reelection—Audience. You will!"", ""The President. [Laughing]—but if our great renewal is to take root, I'll need the help and support of good men and women in the Congress, and that's why we need people like Senator Jesse Helms.

[Applause] All right. All right."", ""North Carolina couldn't have a more valuable export this year than Jesse Helms being sent to Washington.

You know, 30 years ago President Eisenhower came here to Charlotte.

And he said, looking out at you, the people of Charlotte,. . . the heart of America is always sound, and America\'s judgment . . . is always correct."" And if a President knows that, he said, and hews to the wisdom of the people, then he can be certain that in the long run he will have done his job well.', ""Well, I look at all of you, and I feel the same way Ike did. And I thank you for continuing your traditions of inspiring Presidents, and thank you for your warmth and your kindness. And I particularly thank the young people of Matthews Elementary School who came here. They'd invited me to go there, and the schedule wouldn't permit that, so they came here. And I'm glad they did, and it's wonderful to see them."", ""But let me also say—and to those of you who back there can't be quite as conscious of it—down here in front are massed so many young people.Audience.

They are what this election is all about. Something happened in the years between when I was that age and where I am now. And some of what we had prided in—taken pride in having in America seemed to disappear, and that was the opportunity, the freedom, the belief that we the people are the most powerful element in our country, not any level of government. And there became in recent years a feeling that, well, there wasn't opportunity, that we had to resign ourselves to a lesser standard of life than we had known in the past."", ""Well, I want to say to all these young people, those who were saying that were blowing smoke. They didn't know what they were talking about. There is opportunity, unlimited opportunity. And that's what we're about to restore for all of you."", 'So, all of you, thank you again.

But there are many things to talk about this October. On the way here, I was thinking of how to sum up 3.5 years of effort by the American people to turn our economy and our nation around, how to sum up your success. And it seems to me that the past 3.5 years have been an historic time in our country, a time of great renewal. Our nation has hope again, opportunity abounds, the American dream is reborn. And this is what I would call the overview. But would you like the facts to back it up? [Applause]"", ""Well, we're enjoying the strongest economic expansion in 30 years. We've created more than 6 million new jobs in the last 22 months. And 600,000 new businesses were incorporated last year alone. And here in your State, in Michigan, brave technologies for men and women are putting forward advanced technologies, modernizing our world and our older industries, working to create new hopes, new jobs, and new dreams. And with labor and management pulling together with renewed confidence and spirit, our competitors are about to learn that once Americans put our minds to it, once we're provided the proper tools and equipment, we can outproduce, outcompete, and outsell anybody, anytime, anywhere in the world."", ""Now, none of this great national renewal happened by accident. It wasn't a matter of chance. Our renewal was the result of a policy aimed at lightening the tax burden on the American people. That's what helped get our economy moving again.

Now, I think you understand that indexing is the reform that we passed to protect you from the cruelest tax—the hidden tax caused by government using inflation to force you into higher and higher tax brackets. As you get a cost-of-living increase you move up. You're not any better off, you just kept pace with inflation. But suddenly you're in a higher percentage of tax bracket."", ""Now, that is scheduled by our tax program to go into effect on January 1st. That's when it begins. But Sunday, he said that he would repeal that protection. In fact, he said it before. But today, I gather that he says now, as of this morning, that he didn't mean that. Well, it's no wonder he thinks he goofed. The price of repealing index would be enormous. For a family earning $30,000, it would mean over $500 more in taxes per year by 1989. For a family earning 40,000, it'd be over $850 more."", 'And, now, you may not like the sound of that. But wait, it gets worse. The greatest hardship in his repeal of indexing would fall on those who can least afford it: everybody below the $25,000 earning line, everybody. The people that he claimed he would protect-the heaviest proportional burden falls on those least able to pay. In fact, it gets so bad as you go down the line that people earning $10,000 or less would have to pay about $200 a year more in taxes.', ""Well, it's nice that my opponent was willing to explain his two-part tax plan: raise taxes and raise them again. But it's the height of unfairness to make hard-working people pay even more taxes just to finance excessive campaign promises."", ""Now, believe me, this is one issue that affects every family in Michigan, every family in this country. One way or another my opponent's tax increases would not only stop the economy dead in its tracks; they would put a new and ever-increasing burden on you and your neighbors and your children. And he would turn us back to the old days where the politicians dance and you pay the piper."", ""The last thing we need now is a return to the policies of tax and tax and spend and spend. Those policies stifled creativity and growth. What we do need is a tax policy that offers incentives for people to work, save, and invest—all the things that'll keep the economy growing."", ""You know, it's hard sometimes to put recent events in historical perspective. We get caught up in everyday things. Sometimes we forget that we're part of a long continuum that stretches back two centuries to a little gathering in Philadelphia."", 'And those who gathered there envisioned and created a totally new thing in history: a splendid union of States headed by a Federal Government whose members would be elected by the people and who would serve at the sufferance of the people. It was made clear from the beginning that the citizenry would allow the government certain rights—rights would not flow from the government to the people; it would be the other way around.', 'All over the world there are constitutions. And most of them promise a lot of the same things that ours guarantees. But there\'s one difference so fundamental that is tells the whole story. All those other constitutions say, ""We, the government, allow you, the people, to do the following things."" Ours says, ""We, the people, allow you, the government, to do the following things.""', 'Audience. 4 more years! 4 more years! 4 more years!The President. All right.', 'Audience. 4 more years! 4 more years! 4 more years!', ""The President. All right. Thank you. That thing about we the people—that was changed a bit. And some decided that it was the state from which all blessings flow. So, we started some years ago to send more money and more power to the Federal Government in the hopes that it would give us better lives. But by the 1970's, it was clear that we had created chaos, disorder in the economy, wild inflation, government programs that tore up the fabric of the family and trampled on tradition."", 'Now, not all of what government has done has been bad. But in recent years, much of it was. And the worse things got, the more the Government took to blaming it on the people. Do you remember a few years ago, where they said the fault was ours? We had a malaise—that we were never going to have things as good again, and we might as well get used to it.', ""Well, in 1980 the American people declared their independence once again. We recognized, once and for all, that a government big enough to give you everything you want is big enough to take away everything you've got. And we recognize that after all this time, Henry David Thoreau was right: that government is best which governs least."", ""Now, we need government, of But when you go from government to big government—to government as the neighborhood bully—it's time for a change, and change we made. We started putting house in order. When we cut tax rates 25 percent, we said, Washington, you've had enough. And when we cut inflation by two-thirds, we said, Economic chaos, your time is past. And we didn't do this for some of the people—we didn't do it especially for blacks or whites, or men and women, or old and young; we did it together, and we did it for everybody."", 'Now, the other side thinks of America as little more than a collection of special interest groups competing against each other, but they ought to wake up to what a united America accomplished while they were busy trying to manipulate this group and that.', ""I believe that we have returned to a proper understanding of who the American people are. We're the people who crossed the plains, sealed the mountains, won the West. We're the people who came up with the inventions that lit the world and filled it with sound and laughter. We're the people who twice in this century have fought in Europe and stood up for decency for all mankind. We're a people, in short, who don't need the supervision of government sophisticates to tell us what is right and good."", ""In the past few weeks, I've gone throughout this country, and I've talked to Americans, and I've taken questions from them. And one of the things that I've tried to talk about is how the revolution of 1980 is open to and eager for the help of the rank-and-file members of the Democratic Party. I hope that there are many present here today—I was one myself once. And whenever I talk about Franklin Delano Roosevelt or Harry Truman or John F. Kennedy, my opponents start tearing their hair out. They just can't stand it. Well, of course they can't, because it highlights how far they, the leadership today of the Democratic Party, has strayed from the strength of the democratic political tradition."", ""The good and decent Democrats of the rank and file, patriotic Democrats by the millions, they haven't changed. Like their former leaders, they're clear-eyed about the world. They have few illusions, and they consider themselves to be Americans first, and not members of a special interest group."", ""When John Kennedy was President, he didn't push a program of dreary mediocrity with endless tax increases on those who dream of better days. He challenged Americans, just as we're challenging you today, to make America grow and to make America great by pushing for lower personal income tax rates for all the working people of America. And there was a great similarity between his tax cut program and the one that we implemented in 1981."", ""But the leaders of the present Democratic Party, as I've said, have gone so far left, they've left the mainstream. They no longer stand for what their great party always stood for. And that's a sad change; and I don't welcome it, because it's not good for this country. We see things as they are, and that's why I ask Democrats to listen to us, to give us a chance, to consider whether or not we don't, in fact, stand for the justice and decency that you've always cared about. We welcome you. You're not without a home. We're building a new grassroots opportunity party. We need your new blood, your ideas, your enthusiasm, and your energy."", ""Finally, I want to talk about the bright future I anticipate if we continue on the path that we've begun. We're going to continue to force personal income tax rates down, not up. We're going to continue curbing government's appetite. And that's going to keep the economy blooming. It is going to continue to grow. It's going to create millions of more jobs and new worlds of opportunity for all of us—all of us together. And with that new economic freedom, we'll have more time and more opportunity to explore the things of the soul. We'll be a nation even greater in art and learning and scientific inquiry; a nation great in observance and worship and love for the God who made us."", ""I'm talking about a future of flowering possibilities, a future that is safe, secure, and stable. That's the world that I envision. And I hope that you'll join me as we create that future together. [Applause] I knew you would. You are, after all, the new revolution. And you're leading the way, as you always have.And may I add something here?"", 'Audience member. We love you, President Reagan!', ""The President.

39,Ronald Reagan ,"October 10, 1984","[""The President. Frank, I thank you very much. Reverend clergy, Mr. Mayor, Congressman Bill Broomfield, and all of you: I'll try something: Dobry den [Good day]."", ""Well, I appreciate this chance to break bread with you. This center represents something special about America. We Americans came from many lands; we represent just about every race, religion, and ethnic group that's found on this planet. We take pride in our family heritage, passing it on to our children, just like you're doing here. Yet, what keeps us together, what cements our national unity, is our abiding love of freedom. And I think that's what America is all about."", ""And that's what this hall is all about, and I'm proud to be with you here today. I have always believed—and seeing these wonderful young people today and that entertainment, representing so many backgrounds—I just, I've always believed that somehow, Divine Providence put this continent here between the oceans to be found by people from every corner of the Earth, but who had that special love for freedom in their heart that would make them pick up, leave friends and family, and move to this at-onetime strange and completely undeveloped land. And we are so unique, there is no place on Earth quite like us."", ""If America is to remain the free and vibrant country that we want her to be, and if she's to be the great land of opportunity, we can't lose sight of those principles laid down by our Founding Fathers. And we must have the same courage and dedication as those brave souls who built America to do what is necessary to keep our country prosperous and to keep her secure from the threat of foreign tyrants and authoritarian ideologies."", 'A few years ago, we had great cause for concern. The economy was in a shambles. Murderous inflation, economic stagnation, oppressive taxation, and sky-high interest rates were all sapping the strength of our people. Instead of providing leadership, many elected officials joined a chorus of pessimists, bemoaning everything that was wrong with America.', 'Well, let me just say in the last 4 years we\'ve made a new beginning. And I believe that on November 6th, the American people are going to tell the politicians of the past, ""Forget it, we\'re not going back to that unhappy past.""', 'Our people are enjoying the fruits of low inflation and high growth. Productivity is up. Real take-home pay is up. Business incorporations hit a record high last year—600,000 in that single year. Over 6 million new jobs have been created since the beginning of the recovery. Our European friends call it the American miracle.', ""Well, it isn't a miracle. It's just that the American people built this recovery. Our administration, with the help of good Congressmen like Bill Broomfield, just eliminated the roadblocks which took the form of irresponsible tax and spending policies, overregulation, and too much power centralized in Washington. Once we got the Government out of the way, the American people, just like they always have, got on with the job of making this a better country for all of us."", ""And that's especially true of you. When you needed a community center, you didn't go to the Government. Under Don Fedorak and Jerry Duzey's leadership, you got together, laid your plans, and went to work. And this center is a tribute to your enterprise. It serves the well-being of your entire community. It was completed back in 1978. But I can't help but think, had you gone to the Government with all its red tape and bureaucratic entanglements, this project probably would have cost, to begin with, twice as much, and you'd be paying for it through higher taxes. And, of course, we'd probably be meeting someplace else, because it wouldn't be finished yet. [Laughter] So, congratulations on a job well done."", ""And I know that you've done so much as individuals and as a community to help those newcomers to our shores build a new life, through organizations like the Ukrainian Congress Committee, the Ukrainian American Relief Committee, and the indigent fund of the Ukrainian National Women's League of America."", ""We need leaders who will encourage people to follow your example, to get involved personally, to strive on their own, to join with others to accomplish what they can before going to government. And that's what this election is all about. The choice this year is between two teams with two distinct philosophies. An opponent, unable to shake loose from the failed policies of the past, still trapped in the mentality of tax and tax and spend and spend, believes in bigger and bigger government. And that's why he made raising taxes the centerpiece of his campaign, his first option in dealing with the problems of America. His tax program would bring back inflation, would knock the legs out from under the recovery with a tax hike equal to $1,890 for every American household—that's more than $150 a month. He's got a knee-jerk reaction in favor of taxes. And every time his knee jerks, we get kicked. [Laughter]"", 'Let me ask you, would you agree that raising taxes is the wrong way to make your family and your country strong?', 'Audience. Yes!', 'The President. All right. Well, I kind of expected that answer here in Michigan. [Laughter]', ""But instead of raising your taxes, we need to simplify the tax system, make it easier to understand, and make it easier for us to bring down your tax rates, not let them go up. Our opponents see an America in which every day is April 15th, tax day. [Laughter] Well, we see an America in which every day is the Fourth of July. Instead of raising your taxes, we'll promote policies that bring economic growth and increase opportunity. I think the best social program for the less fortunate who are trying to better their lot is a good job."", ""What we want is a strong and a prosperous America, an America that'll be entering the next century with confidence and optimism. Those wedded to the failed policies of the past, or tied too closely to special interest groups, may be unable to see the great potential that lies ahead."", 'How many of you watched on television as one of our magnificent space shuttles blasted off into space or landed after a successful mission? I\'m sure everyone has taken a look at that. I was proud to be there in the California desert to welcome back the Columbia and her gallant crew sometime ago. And I remember: Suddenly they rushed me up on the platform and they said, ""Get ready, you know, it\'s coming,"" and was making its approach and would be landing in a few minutes, and I didn\'t see anything. And I said, ""Well, where is it right now?"" And they said, ""It\'s just coming over Honolulu."" [Laughter] And sure enough, in a matter of minutes, there it was and it was landing. [Laughter] When you stop and think that within a single lifetime of some of us, we\'ve gone from the horse and buggy to that space shuttle—just in one lifetime.', ""If my opponent had his way, there never would have been a shuttle program. He led the fight against starting the shuttle program. He would have spent the money beefing up the bureaucracy in Washington, DC, and that wouldn't get you off the ground 1 inch. [Laughter]"", ""But that program, by developing America's technological genius and by providing so many benefits, was an investment in the future. And it was worth every cent."", ""Today we're trying to make up for shortsighted decisions of the last decade. That's especially true in regard to our national security. Between 1970 and 1980, when the rest of the budget was skyrocketing out of sight, real spending for defense fell by over 20 percent. By the end of the decade, our Navy had dropped from over a thousand ships to under 500. Our Air Force was flying bombers that were, in some cases, older than the pilots."", 'Perhaps the policymakers—and this twisted logic is still around—they were making mistakes—or mistaking weakness, I should [ say, for peace. My opponent in this campaign has made a career out of weakening America\'s Armed Forces. He\'s always found one reason or another for opposing vital weapons systems and the modernization of our forces. As for me, I agree with President Dwight Eisenhower when he said, ""To be strong nationally is not a sin. It is a necessity.""', ""One of our top priorities since coming to Washington has been rebuilding our defensive strength, and I make no apologies for that. I pledge to you that as long as I'm president, I will never shortchange the security needs of the United States of America."", ""We take our responsibilities very seriously. We are, for example, absolutely committed to root out waste and fraud and make certain that every defense dollar is used wisely. And those that you've heard lately talking about $500 hammers and $9,000 wrenches don't add, when they say that, that that's been going on for a long time. And when we got here, we started cleaning it up. We're the ones that brought those figures to light, made them public, and we are cleaning it up."", 'And there have been millions and millions of dollars in rebates returned to the Government as a result. And we, just a few days ago in the White House, the Rose Garden, recognized 12—some in uniform and some Defense Department civilian employees-who individually had tracked down and found some of these things that had resulted in millions of dollars of savings for us. There had been hundreds of indictments and convictions for fraud on the part of people, some people, that were doing these things.', ""But let's not kid ourselves. Even when we root out the waste, providing adequate defense is still an expensive proposition, especially when you're playing catchup. Now, those who are complaining the loudest about the cost are, for the most part, the same architects of a decade of neglecting America's security needs."", ""Well, I don't think America's listening to those voices anymore. New voices are being heard now, strong voices that advocate the cause of freedom, voices not ashamed to defend America's interests. There is one such advocate of whom I'm particularly proud. She's our Ambassador to the United Nations, Jeane Kirkpatrick. She represents a new realism in foreign policy. No longer do we apologize to tyrants about the American way of life, or apologize to those domestic critics who always blame America first."", ""She hadn't been in the United Nations Very long until there was one of those days when about 27 countries on the floor blasted away at America for this or that. And the next afternoon, kind of abashed, they were calling on our Ambassador to apologize. They'd gotten 27 letters—each one of them had gotten a letter, 27 of them, the very next morning from Jeane Kirkpatrick. [Laughter]"", ""We're building up the Voice of America so your message, our message, gets through to captive people everywhere. We seek no conflict with anyone. We've gone the extra mile and will continue to do so to reach arms reduction agreements. But from now on, when America negotiates, we'll negotiate from a position of strength."", ""Now, there's another group of Americans we should be thanking. During the previous administration, as preparedness sank, so did morale in our Armed Forces. And today, because they know how much we appreciate them, we've attracted the finest young men and women to the service who have ever served this country. But freedom, our freedom, is really in their hands. And their commanders tell me that we've got every reason to be confident and proud. And I hope if you see one of those young people now and then on the street in uniform somewhere, you'll tell him or her how grateful we are for the job they're doing."", ""There is a new spirit in America—well, it's not really new. We just recaptured some of that optimism and grit, that love of liberty and zest for life that have always been so much a part of America. And you represent the dream of America more than most. I know that many of you came here with little or no resources. With your hard work and the will to get ahead, you've built a good and decent life for your families, and that's what America is all about."", 'I hope I can count on your support, so that in the next 4 years we can make certain that we pass on a strong, free, secure, and opportunity-filled America to our children, to the next generation.', 'Audience. 4 more years! 4 more years! 4 more years!', ""The President.

I happen to like Ohio so much, that I decided to spend the day here. Now, as Jim told you and I'm sure you all know, we're about to embark on a train trip through your State. And of all the things we've done in this campaign, there's nothing I've looked forward to more."", ""We're taking the whistle-stop tour of '84 to demonstrate that our government is once again on the right track, and our national renewal is not going to be derailed. I'll be traveling on the same train that Harry Truman used in the 1948 campaign. And all of us who remember what he said know that he spoke some very blunt truths, and that's what I hope to do today."", 'Sometime back I made a rather big statement. I said that this election is the most significant in half a century. And I said it because the issues of this campaign are so clear cut and the differences in philosophy and approach to government are so great, that this year America will either ratify the great turn that we made in 1980 or decide to go back to the old days and the old ways.', ""Well, in some ways I think we're like the pioneers who won the West—we can stick together, stand together, and move on together, or we can retreat in small groups from the challenges of a great new world. I think we'll decide as the pioneers did."", ""You know, like the pioneers, we might remember for a few minutes the desert we had to go through to get here. We've come a long way in less than 4 years. And together, we've put all of that old tired talk about malaise and the age of limits behind us. We have, together, disproved two major myths, fairy tales, about America: that her best days were behind her and that the people were powerless to solve problems. Do you remember when they were telling us that and that we were going to have to get along with less? [Applause] Well, we have restored hope and confidence, faith and courage, and returned them as the birthright of every American."", ""In the economy, as you have been told, we reduced inflation by two-thirds, down to 4.2 percent for the last year. We got the prime interest rate—which by 1980 was the highest since the Civil War—we got that down by 40 percent. It's now down by 9 points. We cut unneeded Federal regulations, and this alone will save consumers and businesses about $150 billion over the next 10 years. Do you know that with a task force cutting back on regulations, we have eliminated your paperwork—government-required paperwork—by 300 million man-hours a year?"", ""In education, we shifted the emphasis from how much government spends to how much students learn. And the result is a renewed commitment to excellence and scholastic aptitude test scores that are going up again for the first time in 20 years. In fact, this year they jumped 4 points, and that doesn't sound like much, but it is the biggest increase in 20 years."", ""Now, not everything is going up. We got tough on street crime and violent crime, and the crime rate has dropped for 2 years in a row. And it's the first time it's done that in a long time."", ""We've made America less dependent on foreign oil. We deregulated the oil prices. And, oh my, they said that gasoline would go to $2 a gallon. Well, gasoline prices are nearly a dime less than they were since we took office."", ""We saved the Social Security system from collapse while benefits continued to rise. And this is one—let me just pause and say here—this attack, so falsely based, that it's frightening so many senior citizens unnecessarily, I'm going to repeat what I said on a certain Sunday night recently. No one in our administration has any idea of pulling the rug out from under the people who are dependent on Social Security."", ""And there's one more item I'll mention. We cut tax rates by 25 percent for every taxpayer in the country. Now, I want to talk about that, about taxes, because taxation is an issue with profound economic consequences. We cut persona] tax rates for every taxpayer in the country to stimulate economic growth and boost economic expansion. And to the surprise of some people, but not to us, it worked. With lower taxes, the economy created over 6 million jobs in the last 21 months alone. With lower taxes, nearly 900,000 businesses were incorporated in the 17-month period that ended in May of this year. Now, that's good for all of us. But it's especially good for those who, through no fault of their own, have been unemployed. You know, when you create just one job, when you release just one man or woman from the prison of unemployment, then you've changed their lives forever. And that's the moral element of taxation, letting the economy bloom so that the poor and the disadvantaged can have a chance."", ""Now, my opponent promises to raise your taxes. That's what he says. And believe me—Audience. Boo-o-o!"", ""The President. —of all the promises he's made this year, that's the one he'd keep."", ""I believe that the American people will resoundingly reject his call for heavy new taxes, because, unlike him, they've learned from experience. They've learned that high tax rates discourage effort, investment, production, and enterprise. But low tax rates stimulate those things, and that creates jobs, and jobs are exactly what Ohio and every other State needs more of."", ""Now, let's talk about what the tax increases he'll need to pay for all his promises will do to you personally. If my opponent is to keep all the promises that he has made in this campaign—and we've priced them out—he would have to increase taxes by the equivalent of $1,890 per household. That's more than $150 a month for every household."", ""He started to expose more of his tax plans the other night. He said he would repeal indexing, which we passed to keep government from using inflation to force you into higher tax brackets. Now, that would mean an additional enormous tax increase. But now he's pulled back from that. He says he goofed the other night; he didn't mean to say that, according to him."", ""But even so, his increases wouldn't be just a hardship, they'd be like a second mortgage. But the Mondale mortgage is a mortgage on your future, to pay for his campaign promises. And let me tell you about that mortgage. The payments will get bigger and bigger and bigger. As he puts more heavy taxes on the people and on their businesses, the economy will slow down and slow down and slow down. And after that kills the recovery, he'll want to raise your taxes again and again to make up for it. Do you want to pay for his mistakes?Audience. No!"", 'The President. Well, my opponent says the deficit is the central issue; we say growth is the central issue. Now, he says higher taxes are the answer; we say higher taxes are the problem, because they kill growth, kill creativity, and kill productivity.', ""We want to simplify the entire tax system so we can bring yours and everybody's income tax rates further down, not up. And that's why this election is about the future, because it's about growth and opportunity for all Americans. We're talking about the kind of America we'll create for our children. And I think this is why—this, being able to imagine a better future for our young people and work toward it—that's why so many of the young people of the country support our philosophy, and I'm pleased to see so many of them here today."", 'Audience. 4 more years! 4 more years! 4 more years!', 'The President.

Do you remember the grain embargo in which the American farmers paid for our opponent's foreign policy failures? [Applause] Now there's an example both of an unfair policy and of an artful attempt to get around it. My opponent says he always opposed it. Now that's funny, because in fact he supported it publicly, explicitly, and enthusiastically. He even questioned the patriotism of a Senator in his own party for calling it what it was a dumb idea.

Now that, too, would create jobs and growth and economic revitalization for troubled areas.

Those wonderful people that are up there, and what they\'re doing, and just to give you some idea of the miracle that\'s taken place in all this—and which if someone had his way several years ago, we wouldn\'t have had a shuttle program at all; he opposed it very much—but the time that I was present out at Edwards Air Force Base in California for the landing of the shuttle, they suddenly grabbed me and hustled me up on the platform. And they said, ""It\'s, you know, getting close. It\'ll just be minutes now."" And I got on the platform, and I couldn\'t see anything in the sky. And I said, ""Well, where are they right now?"" They said, ""They\'re just over Honolulu."" [Laughter] And believe me, they were on their glide path from Honolulu in. And in a matter of minutes, they landed there in California.', ""That's quite a miracle that we have going up there. But there are going to be a lot more miracles in the days ahead here in this country of ours, thanks to people like you."", ""So, God bless you all.

And that\'s what I\'m going to do.', ""We're now 3 1/2 weeks away from election day, and the American people are getting the full flavor of the clear choice that's facing them. It's a choice between two fundamentally different ways of governing and two different ways of looking at America.

Well, we look at them as individuals to be fulfilled through their own freedom and creativity. My opponent and his allies live in the past. They are celebrating the old and failed policies of an era that has passed them by, as if history had skipped over those Carter-Mondale years.', ""On the other hand, millions of Americans join us in boldly charting a new course for the future. From the beginning their campaign has lived on promises. Indeed, Mr. Mondale has boasted that America is nothing if it is not promises. Well, the American people don't want promises, and they don't want to pay for his promises."", ""I think you want promise. You want opportunity and workable answers. It's fitting that we're campaigning today on Harry Truman's train, following the same route he took 36 years and 1 day ago.

Mr. Truman could also make very plain the differences between himself and an opponent. And that's what I'm going to try to do today."", 'Let\'s start with the record, the record of the administration in which Mr. Mondale carried a full partnership. He—Mr. Carter, himself—said, ""There wasn\'t a single decision I made during 4 years in the White House that Fritz Mondale wasn\'t involved in."" Well, in those 4 years they took the strongest economy in the world, and they pushed it to the brink of collapse. They created a calamity of such proportions that we\'re still suffering the consequences of those economic time bombs.', ""That was no fresh-faced, well-fed baby they left on our doorstep in January of 1981. It was a snarling economic wolf with sharp teeth. The suffering of America, the deep and painful recession, and the outrageous and frightening inflation—these things didn't start by accidental ignition or spontaneous combustion. They came about through the concerted mismanagement of an administration of which Mr. Mondale was a part, and his liberal friends who controlled the Congress."", ""They gave us five—in little more than a year—five anti-inflation plans—five different economic plans.

While it took them five plans to nearly triple inflation, it's only taken us one to cut it down by twothirds."", 'Senior citizens were driven into panic by higher rents, exorbitant fuel costs, dramatically increasing food prices, and a Federal health care cost which went up, in those 4 years, 87 percent. And they called that fairness. They punished the poor and the young who struggled as prices of necessity shot up faster than others. Millions of Americans led a life of daily economic terror, fueled by these unrelenting costs.', ""Well, let's look at interest rates. My opponent has referred to something he calls real interest rates. Well, people don't pay interest rates based on some academic smoke screen or foggy economic theory.

All right. [Laughing] Okay, you talked me into it. [Laughter]', ""But in that time, the average monthly mortgage payments more than doubled. Young people couldn't buy homes, ear loans were hard to get and expensive, the auto and the homebuilding industries were brought to their knees. It's little wonder that the American people were yearning for leadership back in 1980. After all this economic punishment, our opponents blamed you for living too well. They said that's what was at fault and that you had to sacrifice more."", 'Well, I found that it\'s not so much that our opponents have a poor memory of this ruinous past, they just have a darn good ""forgetory."" And one of the things they\'d like most to forget is the misery index. Do you remember that?', 'That was where they added the unemployment rate and the inflation rate together. And in 1976, in that campaign, the misery index was 12.6, and they declared that Jerry Ford had no right to seek reelection being responsible for that kind of a misery index, 12.6.', ""But now came the 1980 campaign, and they never mentioned the misery index. And I don't think my opponent will mention it in this campaign, possibly because when he left the Vice Presidency the misery index was more than 20 percent, and now it's only 11.6."", 'He\'s done a little slipping and sliding and ducking away from this record, but here in Ohio during the primaries, Senator Gary Hart got his message through by reminding the Ohio voters of the true record. And I quote. Senator Hart said, ""Walter Mondale may pledge stable prices, but Garter-Mondale couldn\'t cut 12-percent inflation."" ""Waiter Mondale,"" he added, ""has come to Ohio to talk about jobs. But Carter-Mondale watched helpless as 180,000 Ohio jobs disappeared in the period between 1976 and 1980."" Those are Gary Hart\'s words.', ""Well, those disastrous consequences didn't come about by accident. They came through the implementation of the very policies of out-of-control spending, unfair taxation, and worship of big government that my opponent still supports. His philosophy can be summed up in four sentences: If it's income, tax it. If it's revenue, spend it. If it's a budget, break it. And if it's a promise, make it. [Laughter]"", 'All this year he has lavished his campaign with promises that staggered even his own Democratic opponents in the primary. Your own Senator Glenn was heard to say in frustration that Mr. Mondale, and I quote, ""has just promised everything to everybody with no thought of how it\'s going to be paid for."" And then he said, ""Fritz, you cannot lead this country if you\'ve promised everybody everything.""', 'But of course there is a predictable answer by one who makes so many promises. His answer is higher taxes, and massive new tax increases are precisely what he proposes. A few weeks back he called his new plans ""Pay as you go."" What it is, of course, is nothing but the old plan: You pay, and he goes. [Laughter] Those tax increases to pay for his promises add up to the equivalent of $1,890 per household. If Harry Truman had to apply a motto to this radical taxing scheme, he\'d have to say not ""your buck stops here""-""your buck never stops."" [Laughter]', 'When the centerpiece of his economic program is backbreaking tax hikes, you can see why my opponent spends so much time using outrageous scare tactics.', 'Now, that\'s not my opponent\'s only tax extravaganza. He came up with still another one in our debate. He said, and I quote, ""As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, I would like to see the total repeal of indexing."" Now, this tax is even worse, because it would be a dagger at the heart of every low- and middle-income taxpayer in America. It would mean bone-crushing new levies against those who can least afford them.', ""Indexing was a reform that we passed—it goes into effect on January 1st, this coming year—to protect you from the cruel, hidden tax, when government uses inflation to force you into higher tax brackets when you've maybe just gotten a cost-of-living pay raise trying to keep even."", ""Under his plan, here's what would happen to a family struggling on $10,000 per year: By 1989 they would be paying over 73-percent more in income taxes. For families making $30,000 a year, this tax would take over $500 more in '89, nearly $900 a year more for those making $40,000, and these assume modest inflation. If we had their higher double-digit inflation rates back, then all those tax collections would more than double. And we're told that he misspoke, that he actually meant to say just the opposite."", ""But on several occasions since 1982, he has expressly proposed the repeal of indexing. He's done this quite often. In politics they call this, sometimes, flip-flops. In this case—forgive me—I'm going to call it a Fritz-flop. [Laughter]"", ""Indexing is one example, but there are many others. Yesterday he wanted to give a $200 tax break to every family dependent. Today he wants to raise taxes the equivalent of $1,890 per household. You know, he's done a lot of talk lately that there's a new and an older Reagan. And he doesn't mean my age when he's talking that. He means that the old Reagan said things differently than the new Reagan is saying them."", ""Well, the old Mondale said that tightening the budget and reducing deficits would worsen a recession, and a new Mondale thinks higher taxes lead to a healthy economy. The old Mondale publicly supported Jimmy Carter's wrong-headed grain embargo, and a new Mondale claims he opposed it privately—awful privately; no one else ever heard him."", ""The old Mondale sponsored National Bible Week in the United States Senate. I think that's fine. The new Walter Mondale says there's too much religion in politics. And the old Mondale called the space shuttle a horrible waste, a space extravaganza, and led the fight to kill it in the Senate. And the new Mondale praises American technological achievement."", ""But just when you're beginning to lose faith, you find there is some constancy. The old Mondale increased your taxes, and the new Mondale will increase them again."", 'You know, in our debate I got a little angry all those times he distorted my record. And on one occasion I was about to say to him very sternly, ""Mr. Mondale, you are taxing my patience."" [Laughter] And then I caught myself. Why should I give him another idea? [Laughter] That\'s the only tax he hasn\'t thought about. [Laughter]', ""Well, from now until November 6th, we're going to make sure that the American people know about this choice on which their future depends. We have two roads to tomorrow: We have the road of fear and envy that he proposes. And on his road you frighten the elderly with false statements; you strive to divide Americans against each other, seeking to promote envy and portray greed. Franklin Roosevelt warned us that the only thing we had to fear was fear itself. Well, sadly and tragically, I think the only thing my opponent has to offer is fear itself."", ""When I said the elderly citizens—being frightened. Again, these repeated charges that somehow we're nursing a secret plan to undercut the people who are on Social Security and reduce or remove their benefits—I said it on Sunday night, and I will say it again: There is no one in this administration-and if there was, they wouldn't be here long—that has any intention of taking Social Security away from those people who have it and who deserve it."", 'We see things differently, as I said, because we see ourselves in a springtime of hope, ready to fire up our courage and determination to reach high and achieve all the best. We see a life where our children can enjoy—at last—prosperity without inflation. We see a life where they can enjoy the highest of creativity and go for the stars, not have their hopes and dreams crushed by politicians or taxed away by greedy governmentalists.', ""The American people are walking into tomorrow unashamed, unafraid. And again, I have to say something that I've been saying so often across this country, and I mean it with all my heart. One of the most thrilling things is to see so many young Americans present at these rallies."", ""Let me tell you, you are what this campaign and this election are all about. There's one thing that the rest of us and the people of my generation have to do before we leave the scene, and that is restore this country—as I think we've begun to do—so that one day you will find the same America of unlimited hope and opportunity that we were promised and found when we were young that had been left to us by our parents."", ""You know, I know you're ready for great opportunity, and I know this may gall our opponents, but—it's time for the train to move on—and I think maybe you'll all agree with me when I say just one more line: We think we've made a good beginning, but you ain't seen nothin' yet.

In those 4 years, they took the strongest economy in the world and pushed it to the brink of collapse. They created a calamity of such proportions that we're still suffering the consequences of those economic time bombs."", ""You know, on that January 20th in 1981 that was no fresh-faced, well-fed baby that was left on our doorstep. It was a snarling economic wolf with sharp teeth. The suffering of America, the deep and painful recession, the outrageous and frightening inflation-these things didn't start by accidental ignition or spontaneous combustion. They came about through the concerted mismanagement of the administration of which he was a part, and his liberal friends who controlled the Congress. They gave us five-you can count them—in a little more than a year, five different anti-inflation plans, and then ended up giving us the worst 4-year record of inflation in nearly 40 years. While it took them five plans to nearly triple inflation, it's only taken us one to cut it by nearly two-thirds."", 'Senior citizens were driven into panic by higher rents, exorbitant fuel costs, dramatically increasing food prices, and Federal health care costs which went up a massive 87 percent. Some fairness. They punished the poor and the young who struggled as prices of necessity shot up faster than the other prices. Millions of Americans led a life of daily economic terror, fueled by those unrelenting costs.', ""Let's look at interest rates. Now, my opponent has referred to something that he calls real interest rates. Well, people don't pay interest rates on some academic smoke screen or foggy economic theory. What they know is that when Jerry Ford left office—the end of 1976—the prime interest rate was 6 1/4 percent. When Mr. Mondale left the Vice Presidency it was 21 1/2 percent, the highest in 120 years."", 'Audience. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. The average monthly mortgage payments more than doubled. Car loans were hard to get and expensive. The automobile and the homebuilding industries were brought to their knees. And after all this economic punishment, guess what? Our opponents blamed you as being the cause, because you lived too well.', 'Audience. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. You remember they told you you were going to have to sacrifice more. Well, I found out that it\'s not so much that our opponents have a poor memory for their ruinous past, they\'ve just a got a darn good ""forgetory."" [Laughter]', ""And you know, one of the things they'd like to forget the most is the misery index. If you'll remember back in 1976, in that campaign, they put the inflation rate and the unemployment rate, added them together, and then called it the misery index. It came to 12.6 percent. And they said that Jerry Ford had no right to seek reelection with such a huge misery index."", ""Well, 1980 came along, and they didn't mention the misery index. And I don't think my opponent will mention it in this campaign, possibly because when he left office the misery index was more than 20 percent, and now it's down to 11.6."", 'My opponent\'s done a very good job of slipping, sliding, and ducking away from this record. But here in Ohio, during the primaries, a Democratic candidate for the nomination, Senator Gary Hart, got his message through by reminding the Ohio voters of the true record. And let me quote Senator Hart. ""Walter Mondale may pledge stable prices, but Carter-Mondale could not cure 12-percent inflation. ""Walter Mondale,"" he added, ""has come to Ohio to talk about jobs, but Carter-Mondale watched helpless as 180,000 Ohio jobs disappeared in the period 1976 to 1980."" Well, those were Gary Hart\'s words.', ""Those disastrous consequences did not come about by accident. They came through the implementation of the very policies of out-of-control spending, unfair taxation, and worship of big government that my opponent still supports. His philosophy can be summed up in four sentences: If it's income, tax it. If it's revenue, spend it. If it's budget, break it. And if it's a promise, make it."", ""All this year he's lavished his campaign with promises that staggered even his Democratic opponents. But, of course, there is a predictable answer by one who makes so many promises. The answer is higher taxes, and massive new tax increases are precisely what he proposes."", 'A few weeks back, he called for his new plan. He said it was ""Pay as you go."" Well, what it is, of course, is nothing but the old plan: You pay, and he goes. Those tax increases to pay for his promises add up to the equivalent of $1,890 per household, for every household in the United States.', 'Now, if Harry Truman had to apply a motto to his radical taxing scheme—I think recalling it for the younger people here who might not recall that it was Harry Truman who sat in the Oval Office and said, ""The buck stops here."" Well, I think with regard to my opponent\'s scheme he would say, ""Your buck never stops.""', 'When the centerpiece of his economic program is backbreaking tax hikes, you can see why my opponent spends so much time using outrageous scare tactics.', 'Now, that\'s not my opponent\'s only tax extravaganza. He came up with still another one in our debate. He said, and I quote, ""As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, I would like to see the total repeal of indexing."" Well, this tax is even worse because it would be a dagger aimed at the heart of every low- and middle-income earner in America. It would mean new, crushing tax levies against those who can least afford them.', ""Indexing was a reform that we passed. It goes into effect on January 1st. And it's to protect you from the cruel, hidden tax, when government uses inflation to force you into higher tax brackets. You get a cost-of-living pay raise that's only meant to keep pace with inflation, but it pushes you into another, higher tax bracket, and you end up paying a higher percentage of tax."", ""Well, under his plan, what would happen to a family struggling on $10,000 per year? By 1989, they would be paying over 73 percent more in income taxes. Now we're told—and he has said in these last few days since the debate—that he misspoke, that he actually meant to say the opposite. But on several occasions since 1982, he's expressly proposed the repeal of indexing. He's done it quite often. In politics, they call that a flip-flop. You'll forgive me, I'm going to call it a Fritz-flop."", 'Indexing is one example, but there are many others. Yesterday he wanted to give a $200 tax break to every family dependent, and today he wants to raise taxes the equivalent of $1,890 per household.', ""Now, for the last couple of weeks in his campaign he's been talking about two Reagans. He says there's a new one and an old one. And he isn't, with that last term, referring to my age— [laughter] —because the old Reagan was younger. That was back there. And the new Reagan, now, is me at the present."", ""But he's been doing that so much that I decided to do some new and old Mondaleing myself. The old Mondale said tightening the budget and reducing deficits could worsen a recession, increase unemployment. The new Mondale thinks higher taxes lead to a healthy economy. The old Mondale publicly supported Jimmy Carter's wrong-headed grain embargo. The new Mondale claims that he opposed it privately-very privately."", 'Audience member. Yeah!', ""Audience member. Give 'em hell, Ron!"", ""The President. The old Mondale sponsored National Bible Week in the U.S. Senate, and that's fine. But the new Walter Mondale says there's too much religion in politics."", 'Audience. No way!', 'Audience. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. The old Mondale called the space shuttle a horrible waste, a space extravaganza, and in the United States Senate he personally led the fight to kill the space shuttle program.', 'Audience. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. Now the new Mondale praises American technological achievement. And well he should, because while I've been going across Ohio on this train, those brave young men and women, those heroes, have been up there going around the world several times in the Challenger."", ""And God bless them for what they're doing.

If you can take it, I can.', 'But now, with all that talk about his in-and-out, old-and-new style, there—and just when you could begin losing faith, still you find there is some constancy. The old Mondale increased your taxes. And you can count on him—the new Mondale will, too.', 'You know, in our debate I got a little angry at all those times he distorted my record. And on one occasion I was just about to say to him very sternly, ""Mr. Mondale, you\'re taxing my patience."" [Laughter] And then I caught myself. Why should I give him another idea? That\'s the only tax he hasn\'t thought of. [Laughter]', ""But from now until November 6th, we're going to make sure the American people know about this choice on which their future depends. We have two roads to tomorrow. We have the road of fear and envy that he proposes. On his road, you frighten the elderly with false statements."", ""And let me interrupt my thought right here to say something about that. Political demagoguery is unpleasant at best. But in the 1982 congressional elections, and now in this present election, there has been some cheap demagoguery, political expediency, when he has deliberately frightened, brought fear to elderly citizens who are dependent on Social Security for their livelihood, when he says that somehow we've got some secret plan that we're going to take those benefits away from you, or at least reduce them sizably."", ""Well, if there's anyone in my administration that has such an idea, he's gone tomorrow morning. There isn't anyone on our team that believes that. I tell you now, no, we will not tamper with the benefits of the people dependent on Social Security or those that you are expecting when you come to your nonearning years.

Thank you.', ""You know, they try to divide us with envy and greed. Franklin Roosevelt warned that the only thing Americans have to fear is fear itself. And sadly and tragically, the only thing my opponent has to offer is fear itself. Now, that's the difference between us. We see America's best days as still ahead. We see ourselves in a springtime of hope, ready to fire up our courage and determination to reach high and achieve all the best. We see a life where our children can enjoy—at last—prosperity without inflation. We see a life where they can enjoy the highest of creativity and go for the stars, not have their hopes and dreams crushed-or taxed away—by greedy politicians. The American people are walking into America unashamed and unafraid. They're ready for this great new era of opportunity."", ""And, you know, I have to interrupt myself again.

We\'ve reduced its growth, as you\'ve been told by the mayor, by two-thirds, and today inflation is no longer 12.4 percent; it\'s down to 4.2.', ""But you young people must be confident that prices will be stable, and older Americans must never again live through the nightmare of seeing their savings wiped out.

Do you know that that was favored by a leader named Jefferson Davis, to permit a President to veto items of wasteful spending within an appropriations bill. When I had that as a Governor of California, I used it more than 900 times, and they never overrode the veto once.

His insistence on higher tax rates is like playing Russian roulette with our economic security, only in the game the way he plays it, every chamber in the gun would be loaded. [Laughter] His program of high taxes sugarcoated with compassionate rhetoric is a disaster in disguise that will destroy our economic expansion, increase unemployment, and reignite inflation.', ""We don't need a policy of higher taxes; we need a policy of higher growth. And we don't need more power for government; we need more opportunity for people."", ""Now, he talked about me and taxes and what he says I'm going to do. Well, I'll tell you what we want to do. We want to simplify the tax system, make it more fair and easier to understand. When you hear that Albert Einstein said that he couldn't understand the Form 1040, you know our tax system is a little complicated. So, we want to do this to bring down yours and everybody's income tax rates further down, not up."", ""But my opponent even wants to eliminate indexing. That means that he wants you to be pushed by inflation into higher and higher tax brackets, to have less and less take-home pay. Now, we passed indexing-it goes into effect on January lst—and the idea of it, of course, was to prevent a cost-of-living pay raise, in the days of inflation, that's supposed to make you keep even with inflation—to keep that from pushing you into a higher tax bracket where you pay a higher percentage of tax, and thus you're worse off, you haven't kept even at all. And it's a nice way, of course, in which the Congress can have a continuing tax increase without having to go through the unhappiness of introducing one for legislation and voting on it."", ""Supporters of economy-killing tax increases claim they're necessary to decrease the deficit. But at the same time, they're poised and ready to turn on the Federal spending spigot, which we've spent so much time turning off. With the strong support of individuals like your own Congressman Carroll Campbell, we have cut the rate of growth in Federal spending by over 60 percent. When we came here it was 17 percent a year. That was the increase. It's now down to 6.1 percent."", ""But Carroll is a strong voice for responsible government, and I hope you're doing everything you can to send him back to Washington. And while we're talking about responsible government, let's make certain that South Carolina reelects a man who's a giant in that cause—Senator Strom Thurmond. We need elected officials like Congressmen Campbell, Hartnett, and Spence, who have the vision and leadership to offer better options to the American people than simply raising taxes."", ""There are those so entangled in their promises to special interest groups they can't see a better future, much less plan for it. Well, this was never more clear than when my opponent strenuously opposed the space shuttle program. He led the opposition in the Senate in trying to kill us from having such a program. And then, just up until Saturday, we had those young people—men and women—those heroes, up there going around this country of ours. While I was going across Ohio on a train, they were going around the world about six or seven times. And the things that are coming out of that have made it worth every penny that it has cost—the additions, the improvements for our health, the medicines, the materials that are being developed."", ""Well, he opposed that when it was first proposed. He would have spent the money beefing up some bureaucratic programs in Washington, DC.How many of you have seen one of those shuttles blast off into space or glide in for a smooth landing? I'm sure on television you've seen it, if not in reality. It is a magnificent sight, and it's a tribute to America's technological greatness. It's been worth, as I say, every cent."", ""Now, today there is a phenomenon that many of the pollsters can't understand, and I see it everywhere I go, and I see it here today. Young people from every background have rejected the politics of pessimism and are foursquare behind a strong, vibrant, and growing America."", ""And I want to thank all of you young people who are here with us today. We're working to see that when you get out of school, you have the same opportunity that Americans have always had in this country."", ""You know, a few years ago there were people around that were telling you, no, you know, we had to accept limits, that we weren't ever going to have things as good as they had been in the past. Well, they were blowing smoke. I have told, wherever I've gone—because all over the country today, at gatherings like this, I have seen so many young people. And I'm so proud and happy to see them there because I like telling you that my generation and a few generations between mine and yours— [laughter] —there were those of us that knew, just took for granted when we were your age that there was no limit to how high we could go, no limit on what we could do if we were willing to reach for it and go for it."", ""And what I'm determined this election is all about is to make sure that we hand you, when it comes your turn, the same kind of America that our parents handed us.

Until today, it had come down to 12 3/4 percent, and I don't know whether you've heard the news, but today one of the major banks in our country has just dropped it down another half point to 12 1/4 percent. And we expect even more progress on this front."", ""The average monthly mortgage rate payment has come down $143, putting 5 million more Americans in reach of buying their own homes.

And the other track is we've gone the extra mile to reach arms reduction agreements with the Soviet Union, and we'll continue to do so. But from now on, the United States will be negotiating from a position of strength."", ""The commanders of our military forces tell me that we have the finest and most dedicated group of young men and women serving in uniform in our Armed Forces than we've ever had in our history. You know, during the last administration, morale sank to a new low point. And many of those serving our country got the feeling that sacrifice, their sacrifice, was being taken for granted. I can promise you this: Those brave people in our Armed Forces will never doubt our unending gratitude for the job that they're doing."", ""And, you know, I like to suggest this: I hope if you, and especially you students, if you see your counterparts, those young people that are in uniform, down on the street sometime, that you'll maybe just go up and stick out your hand and tell them how proud we are and how thankful we are for their service to America. You'll feel real great after you've done it, and I know how they'll feel. They'll be walking about 3 or 4 inches taller than they were."", 'But looking out here today and thinking about all the young people I\'ve met around the country, I think America has great days ahead.

A great cleric, Pope Paul—or Pius XII, after World War II, made a statement when so much of the world was devastated and the future looked so bleak for everyone, and then he said a profound truth.

But perhaps we can gain greater insight into his leadership abilities and his philosophy if we take a look at his record.', 'To begin with, his grasp of economies is well demonstrated by his economic predictions. Just before we took office, my opponent said that our economic program was obviously, murderously inflationary. And that was just before we lowered the inflation rates from 12.4 percent to 4.2 percent.', 'So, then we got our tax cuts. And right after we got those and started implementing them, he said the most that he could see was an anemic recovery. And that was right before the revitalized economy created more than 6 million jobs in 22 months. And it was right before 900,000 businesses were incorporated in a 17-month period—900,000 new businesses.', ""And then—but what I'm going to tell you now, I have to explain to some of you, I think, a little bit, because it was back in 1976, and some of you were very young in 1976, and our opponents created a thing called the misery index. They added the rate of inflation to the rate of unemployment. And, in the case of Jerry Ford, it came out at 12 1/2 points. So, they said that no one had a right to even seek reelection with a misery index of 12 1/2 percent."", ""Now, my opponent has said that our policies would deliver a misery index the likes of which we haven't seen in a long time. And you know, something? There was some truth in that, because we've got the misery index down to 11.6, and under them it was over 20."", ""You've noticed they aren't talking about the misery index anymore.

Well, as I said, that, again, was before we had brought it down to where it is today."", 'But I\'m not finished here. There\'s so much more to say about my opponent. His grasp of foreign affairs is demonstrated by his understanding of world events. Sometime back, he said, ""The old days of a Soviet strategy of suppression by force are over."" And that was just before the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia. And after they invaded Afghanistan, he said, ""It just baffles me why the Soviets, these last few years, have behaved as they have.""

Unfortunately, they didn't punish the Soviet Union; they punished the American farmers."", 'My opponent said that control of oil prices would cost American consumers more than $36 billion a year. Well, we decontrolled oil prices. It was one of the first things I did.

Thank you, Senator Pete Wilson, Governor Deukmejian, and it feels good to be back in California and with you here in San Diego.', ""I've come to San Diego asking for your support in every campaign that I've ever been in. And I'm here today to ask this last one time. [Applause] Well, I was going to ask if I could count on you, and you've already answered that. And thank you very much."", ""I see something here I've been noticing all over the country—the large number of. young people. I know you're putting yourselves squarely on the side of a strong and a growing America. People of every age, race, and background are flocking to a banner of opportunity. And nowhere is that more clear than in California. Disadvantaged Americans are waking up to the failure of bureaucratic programs to bring them the economic opportunity they need to make real progress."", ""I'm especially pleased that Hispanic-Americans, who are so important to our California heritage, are joining us in increasing numbers. And here in California, we also see our coalition bolstered by Asian-Americans, many of them recent immigrants who have come here like our own forefathers and mothers for freedom and to improve their well-being."", ""Earlier this year, there was a candidate who claimed to be building a rainbow coalition. Well, we're building an American coalition, and that says it all."", ""I want to take this opportunity to thank you for sending to the Congress three Representatives who've been in the forefront of the battle for responsible government and a strong America—Congressmen Bill Lowery, Duncan Hunter, and Ron Packard. I've got a favor to ask' On election day make sure that you send them back to Washington; because if you're going to send me back there, I don't know what I'd do without them. You and all these fine candidates are part of a new spirit that's spreading across America."", ""You know—I assume that maybe some of you saw the debate last night. Well, the format for the debate is sometimes frustrating. When the other fellow's making a lot of misstatements, you don't have time always to challenge them. So, last night I told the people, for example, that Mr. Mondale had voted to kill the F-14 fighter plane. And he said he only voted to delay production. Well, that was one I didn't get to respond to. I'll do it here."", ""On September 29, 1971, he voted on an amendment by Senator Proxmire to kill the F-14. That was no vote to delay; that was a vote to delete. And fortunately, he failed. The planes that did that job that the Senator was referring to, they were F-14's."", 'You know, as election day nears, the American people are getting the full flavor of the very clear choice facing them. Is there an echo out here? 1', '1 The President was referring to a small crowd demonstrating nearby.', ""It's a choice between two fundamentally different ways of governing and two distinct ways of looking at America. My opponent, Mr. Mondale, offers a government of pessimism, fear, and limits compared to ours of hope, confidence, and growth. He sees government as an end in itself. And we see government as something belonging to the people and only a junior partner in our lives. They see people merely as members of groups, special interests to be coddled and catered to. We look at them as individuals to be fulfilled through their own freedom and creativity."", 'My opponent and his allies live in the past, celebrating the old and failed policies of an era that has passed them by, as if history had skipped over those Carter-Mondale years. On the other hand, millions of Americans join us in boldly charting a new course for the future.', ""From the beginning, their campaign has lived on promises. Indeed, Mr. Mondale has boasted that America is nothing if it isn't promises. Well, the American people don't want promises, and they don't want to pay for his promises. They want promise. They want opportunity and workable answers. And that's why we're here—to talk about the record, the record of the administration in which Mr. Mondale carried a full partnership."", 'Mr. Carter himself said, ""There wasn\'t a single decision I made during 4 years in the White House that Fritz Mondale wasn\'t involved in."" In those years, they took the strongest economy in the world and pushed it to the brink of collapse. They created a calamity of such proportions that we\'re still suffering the consequences of those economic time bombs. What they left on our doorstep in January 1981 was a snarling economic wolf with sharp teeth.', ""The suffering of America, the deep and painful recession, and the outrageous and frightening inflation—these things didn't start by spontaneous combustion. They came about through the concerted mismanagement of which Mr. Mondale was a part, and his liberal friends who controlled the Congress."", ""They gave us five—count them—five different anti-inflation plans and managed to give us the worst 4-year record of inflation in nearly 40 years. While it took them five economic plans to nearly triple inflation, it's taken us only one to cut it by about two-thirds."", 'Senior citizens were driven into panic by higher rents, exorbitant fuel costs, dramatically increasing food prices, and Federal health care costs, which went up a massive 87 percent. And they called that fairness.', 'They punished the poor and the young, who struggled as prices of necessities shot up faster than others. Millions of Americans led a life of daily economic terror, fueled by these unrelenting costs. And they called that compassion.', ""Well, let's look at interest rates. My opponent has referred to something he calls real interest rates. Well, people don't pay interest rates based on some academic smoke screen or foggy economic theory. What they know is that when Jerry Ford left office, the prime interest rate was 6 1/4 percent. When Mr. Mondale left office, it was 21 1/2 percent, the highest in 120 years."", ""Average monthly mortgage payments more than doubled. Young people couldn't buy homes. Car loans were hard to get and expensive. The automobile and homebuilding industries were brought to their knees. It's little wonder that the American people yearned for leadership in 1980. And after all this economic punishment, our opponents blamed you, because you lived too well. And they told you you had to sacrifice more and that we were now in an age of limits.Audience. Boo-o-o!"", 'The President. Well, I found out that it\'s not so much that Mr. Mondale has a poor memory of his ruinous past; he\'s just got a darn good ""forgetory."" And now he says, ""I\'m ready to be President."" Well, forgive me, but—', 'I thought he was campaigning in someplace else. 2 [Laughter]', ""Forgive me, but I believe he's more ready to be our problem than our President."", '2 The President was referring to an airplane flying overhead.', ""Now, as Senator Wilson was telling you, on defense, too, he has a record of weakness, confusion, and failure. Before the invasion of Czechoslovakia, he announced that the days of Soviet suppression by force were over. And after the invasion of Afghanistan, he said just what you were told-that he was baffled. There's so much that seems to baffle him."", 'He was confused about the rightness of freeing our students on the island of Grenada. Senator John Glenn said that my opponent would ""cut our Defense Establishment beyond all reality""—cut the B-l, the Nimitz carrier, the Trident, the cruise missile, the foreign troops; would cut the M-1 tank, funds for the volunteer army; kill the shuttle; oppose procurement of the F-14, the Harrier, and the AWACS. Now, I don\'t know if he\'d outlaw slingshots— [laughter] -but he certainly would jeopardize our national security. And we\'re not going to let him do it.', 'Audience. 4 more years! 4 more years! 4 more years!', ""The President. Okay. All right. And, you know, if the Capital were in California, I'd agree to 40."", ""But, you know, something else that our opponents would like to forget is a gimmick from the 1976 campaign, where they added the unemployment and the inflation rates together, and the total—they called it the misery index. And at the end of 1976 it was 12.6, and they declared that the incumbent had no right to seek reelection with that kind of a misery index. Well, 4 years later we were in the 1980 campaign, and they never mentioned the misery index. And I don't think Mr. Mondale will mention it in this campaign, because by 1980 and when he left the Vice Presidency it was over 20. And it's now down around 11."", ""My opponent has done a very good job of trying to slip, slide, and duck away from this record. But we know now that those disastrous consequences didn't come about by accident; they came through the implementation of the very policies of out-of-control spending, unfair taxation, and worship of big government that my opponent still supports."", ""His philosophy can be summed up in four sentences: If it's income, tax it. If it's revenue, spend it. If it's a budget, break it. And if it's promise, make it."", 'All this year Mr. Mondale has lavished his campaign with promises that staggered even his Democratic opponents. Senator John Glenn was heard to say in frustration that Mr. Mondale, and I quote, ""has just promised everything to everybody, with no thought of how it\'s going to be paid for."" And Gary Hart said, ""Fritz, you cannot lead this country if you\'ve promised everybody everything.""', 'But, of course, there is a predictable answer by one who makes so many promises. The answer is higher taxes. And massive new tax increases are precisely what he proposes.Audience. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. A few weeks back, he called his new plan pay-as-you-go. But what it is, of course, is nothing but the old plan. You pay, and he goes. [Laughter]', 'Those tax increases to pay for his promises add up to the equivalent of $1,890 per household; that\'s more than $150 per month. I call it the Mondale mortgage. If Harry Truman had to apply a motto to this radical taxing scheme—and for the young people here who might not remember Harry Truman, he was the fellow that said about the desk that he sat at in the Oval Office, ""The buck stops here""—I have a hunch that if he had to have a motto right now for this particular candidate that I\'ve been talking about, he\'d say, ""Your buck never stops.""', ""But hold on; he's got more. A couple of weeks ago, he said he would like to repeal indexing. Now, this tax is even worse, because it would be a dagger at the heart of every low- and middle-income taxpayer in America. It would mean bone-crushing, new levies against those who could least afford them. Indexing was a reform that we passed to protect you from the cruelest of taxes—the hidden tax that when government uses inflation to force you into higher tax brackets, just because you've gotten a cost-of-living pay raise—that's when your taxes go up."", ""And under the Mondale plan, here's what would happen to a family struggling on $10,000 per year. By 1989 they would be paying over 73 percent more in income taxes if indexing, which begins on this January 1st, is canceled."", ""And then Mr. Mondale reversed himself and said he'd made a mistake. Well, that's something he seems to do quite a lot. [Laughter] But the truth is, that several times between 1982 and now he has expressly proposed the repeal of indexing. In politics they call this a flip-flop. In this case, you'll forgive me if I call it a Fritz-flop."", 'Yesterday he wanted to give you a $200 tax break to every family dependent. And today he wants to raise taxes the equivalent of almost $2,000 a household. You know, for some time, over the last several weeks at least, he was talking about a new Reagan and an old Reagan. Now, that had nothing to do with my age. The old Reagan was the earlier one, the first one—the new Reagan is now. And when he said that, well, he inspired me to do a little of that old and new business.', ""The old Mondale is on record as saying that reducing deficits could worsen a recession. The new Mondale thinks higher taxes lead to a healthy economy. The old Mondale publicly supported Jimmy Carter's wrong-headed grain embargo. And the new Mondale claims that he opposed it—privately. Very privately. [Laughter]"", 'The old Mondale sponsored National Bible Week. Well, old or new, I\'m with him on that one. But this new Mondale says there\'s too much religion in politics. The old Mondale called the space shuttle a ""horrible waste,"" a ""space extravaganza."" And he personally led the fight in the United States Senate to kill the shuttle program before it even started.Audience. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. The new Mondale praises American technological achievement.', 'But just when you were beginning to lose faith you find that there is some constancy with him. The old Mondale increased your taxes, and the new Mondale will do it again.', 'You know, in our debates, I got a little angry all those times that he distorted my record. And on one occasion, I was about to say to him very sternly, ""Mr. Mondale, you\'re taxing my patience."" [Laughter] And then I caught myself. Why should I give him another idea? [Laughter]', 'Well, from now until November 6th, we\'re going to make sure the American people know about this choice on which their future depends. We have two roads to tomorrow. The road of fear and envy that he proposes—on his road, you frighten the elderly with false statements. You strive to divide Americans against each other, seeking to promote envy and promote greed. Franklin Roosevelt warned us, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" Well, sadly and tragically, the only thing that my opponent has to offer is fear itself. And that\'s the difference between us.', ""We see America's best days ahead of us. We see ourselves in a springtime of hope, ready to fire up our courage and determination to reach high and achieve all the best. We see a life where our children can enjoy at last prosperity without inflation. We see a life where they can enjoy the highest of creativity and go for the stars and not have their hopes and dreams crushed or taxed away by greedy governmentalists."", 'In 1980 the American people declared their independence all over again. We realized that when we went from good government to big government, it was time to put our house back in order.', ""Today we've returned to a proper understanding of who the American people are. We're the people who crossed the plains, scaled the mountains, won the .West. We're the people who came up with the inventions that lit the world and filled it with sound and laughter. We're the people who twice in this century have fought in Europe and stood for decency for all mankind."", ""We're a people, in short, who don't need the supervision of government sophisticates to tell us what is right and good. And now the American people are walking into tomorrow unashamed and unafraid. They're ready for this great, new era of opportunity."", ""And, once again, I want to refer to these young people who are with us and these young people all over the country. I didn't get to finish last night what I was going to say. We ran out of time."", 'What I had already said is that all across this country in high schools, in schools on college and university campuses, and among younger people who have finished education and started out into life—seen them all across this country—and, believe me, to the rest of you, or of those other generations, these young people today are very special. Yes, you are. And you know what? The responsibility—and this is what I was going to say last night—the responsibility of my generation and those generations between mine and yours, our responsibility is to see that you grow up in the same kind of country that we grew up in, a country of hope and opportunity. And our job is to hand you an America that is free in a country-or a world that is at peace.', 'Audience. 4 more years! 4 more years! 4 more years!The President.

47,Ronald Reagan ,"October 22, 1984","[""The President. Thank you, Governor Atiyeh, ladies and gentlemen here on the dais, and all of you out there, thank you for a most heartwarming reception. It's great to be back in the beautiful State of Oregon, and it's great to be back in the proud town of Medford."", ""You know, there's something healthy about this part of the country where so many live so close to the land, growing fruit and farming, mining, lumbering. It's a life that produces qualities like character and self-reliance. Indeed, I can think of a few liberal Democrats that I wish, could come here to see it, and then stay. No, no—now wait a minute, you're right—that wouldn't be fair to the people of this good town."", ""But a special greeting to your outstanding Governor, Vic Atiyeh, your fine Senators, Mark Hatfield and Bob Packwood, and to your skilled and dedicated Members of the Congress, Bob Smith and Denny Smith. Believe me, we couldn't have accomplished all we have without the help of determined Republicans like Denny and Bob in the House, and a Republican majority—including Mark and Bob—in the Senate."", ""Recently, these fine Members of the Congress played a central role in passing a vital piece of legislation—the timber relief bill. The timber industry here in the Pacific Northwest has seen more than its share of hard times. And this legislation will enable the industry to gain the full benefits of our economic expansion. For thousands, this bill will mean more jobs, more opportunity, and renewed hope. And I'm happy to tell you that just a few days ago, last week, I signed that timber bill into law."", ""You know, Abe Lincoln said that we must disenthrall ourselves with the past, and then we'll save our country. Well, 4 years ago that's what we did. We made a great turn. We got out from under the thrall of a government which we'd hoped would make our lives better, but which wound up living our lives for us. The power of the Federal Government had, over the decades, created great chaos—economic chaos, social chaos, international chaos. Our leaders were adrift, rudderless, without a compass."", ""Four years ago we began to navigate by certain fixed principles. Our North Star was freedom, and common sense were our constellations. We knew that economic freedom meant paying less of the American family's earnings to the Government, and so we cut personal income tax rates by 25 percent. We knew that inflation, the quiet thief, was stealing our savings. And the highest interest rates since the Civil War were making it impossible for people to own a home or start an enterprise. We knew that our national military defense had been weakened, so we decided to rebuild and be strong again. And this, we knew, would enhance the prospects for peace in the world. It was a second American revolution-and it's only just begun."", 'But what already has come of our efforts? A great renewal. America is back—a giant, reemergent on the scene—powerful in its renewed spirits, powerful in its economy, powerful in the world economy, and powerful in its ability to defend itself and secure the peace.', 'But now, 4 years after our efforts began, small voices in the night are sounding the call to go back, go backward to the days of confusion and drift—', 'Audience. No!', 'The President. All right. And they would have us go back to the days of torpor, timidity, and taxes.Audience. No!', 'The President. Now, my opponent this year is known to you—Audience. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. —but perhaps we can gain great insight into his leadership abilities and his philosophy if we take a look at his record.', 'To begin with, his grasp of economics is well demonstrated by his economic predictions. Just before we took office, my opponent said that our economic program is, obviously, murderously inflationary. Now, that was just before we lowered inflation from above 12 percent to 4.', 'And just after our tax cuts, he said the most he could see was an anemic recovery. That was before our economy created more than 6 million new jobs in 21 months, and just before nearly 900,000 businesses were incorporated in less than a year and a half.', ""My opponent said that our policies would deliver a misery index the likes of which we haven't seen in a long time. And there was some truth in that. You know, you get the misery index by adding the rate of unemployment to the rate of inflation, and they invented that for the 1976 campaign. And they said that Jerry Ford had no right to seek reelection because his misery index was all of 12.6. Now, they didn't mention the misery index in the 1980 election because it had gone up to more than 20. And they aren't talking too much about it in this campaign, because it's down to 11."", ""My opponent said that decontrol of oil prices, which is one of the first things we did, would cost American consumers more than $36 billion a year. Well, we decontrolled oil prices, and the price of gas went down 8 cents a gallon. And they're still headed down."", ""Now, you know, it's just occurred to me that maybe all we have to do to get the economy in absolutely perfect shape is to get my opponent to predict absolute disaster. [Laughter]"", 'He says he cares about the middle class, but he boasts, ""I have consistently supported legislation, time after time, which increases taxes on my own constituents."" Doesn\'t that make you want to be a constituent of his? [Laughter]', ""No, he's no doubt proud of the fact that he voted 16 times as a United States Senator to raise your taxes. And this year he's outdone himself. He's already promised, of course, to raise your taxes. But if he is to keep all the promises he's made to this group and that, we will have to raise taxes by the equivalent of $1,890 for every household. That's more than $150 a month. It's like having a second mortgage. And after the Mondale mortgage, we'd be sure to see more than a few foreclosures."", ""His economic plan has two basic parts: raise your taxes, and then raise them again. [Laughter] But I've got news for him: The American people don't want his tax increases, and he isn't going to get his tax increases."", ""His tax plan would bring recovery to a roaring halt. But I'll give it this: His plan did give me an idea for Halloween. If I could find a way to dress up as his tax program, I could scare the devil out of all my neighbors. [Laughter]"", ""The difference between us is simply this: He sees an America in which every day is tax day, April 15th. We see an America in which every day is the Fourth of July, Independence Day. What we want is to lower your and everybody else's taxes, so that your families will be stronger, our economy will be stronger, and America will be stronger."", ""But I'm not finished here. I'm proud to say that during these last 4 years, not one square inch of territory has been lost to Communist aggression. And the United States is more secure than we were 4 years ago. I know they were complaining because they thought maybe I was speaking too harshly to the Russians, but on the other hand, maybe we got their attention."", 'But there\'s so much more to say about our opponent. His grasp of foreign affairs is demonstrated by the following: Sometime back, he said the old days of a Soviet strategy of suppression by force are over—and that was just before the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia. And after they invaded Afghanistan, he said, ""It just baffles me why the Soviets these last few years have behaved as they have."" [Laughter] But then there\'s so much that baffles him. [Laughter]', 'One year ago we liberated Grenada from Communist thugs who had taken that country over in a coup. And my opponent called what we did a violation of international law that erodes our moral authority to criticize the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.Audience. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. Well, still, I\'ll say this: His administration did mete out strong punishment after Afghanistan. Unfortunately, they punished the American farmer, not the Soviet Union.My opponent supported the grain embargo and spoke out for it often. He even questioned the patriotism of a Senator from his own party when that Senator called that embargo just what it was—unworkable and unfair. Now he seems to have changed his tune. He says he privately opposed the embargo—very privately. [Laughter] As a matter of fact, he has, in the last several months, claimed that he opposed a number of the administration\'s policies when he was Vice President. But as Jody Powell, who was also in that administration, said, ""I guess I was out of the room every time it happened."" [Laughter]', 'After the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua, Mr. Mondale praised it, saying, ""Winds of democratic progress are stirring where they have long been stifled."" But we know that the Sandinistas immediately began to persecute the genuine believers in democracy and to export terror. They went on to slaughter the Miskito Indians, abuse and deport church leaders, slander the Pope, and move to kill free speech. So, why isn\'t my opponent speaking out now about those winds of democracy?', 'More recently, he failed to repudiate the Reverend Jesse Jackson, when he went to Havana, stood with Fidel Castro, and cried: ""Long live Cuba! Long live President Fidel Castro! Long live Che Guevara!""Audience. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. I could say of his economic program that he will either have to break his promises or break the bank. But I won't say it, because Senator John Glenn, a Democrat, already has said it. I could call his economic program a collection of old and tired ideas held together by paralyzing commitments to special interest groups. But I won't, because Senator Gary Hart, a Democrat, has already said that. I could predict that he will create deficits more than twice what they are now. But I won't, because Senator Fritz Hollings, a Democrat, has already said that."", ""Now, if on political issues my opponent dares to be wrong, on domestic policy issues he has the courage to be cautious. A lineitem veto to help control wild government spending—no, he says, that's not part of the liberal agenda. Well, as Governor of California I had the line-item veto. Your Governor has a line-item veto. Forty-two other Governors in the United States have a line-item veto. And you know something? It works. And it would work at the Federal level if we can get them off the dime and get it."", ""He's long opposed enterprise zones to help the most economically troubled neighborhoods in the country. But then a few weeks ago, he said he's for them. Well, if he's for them, why doesn't he ask his friend, Tip O'Neill, to stop blocking the enterprise zone bill which is buried in a committee of the House of which he is the Speaker?"", ""This month an American woman walked in space—the first to do so. Kathryn Sullivan made history. And she returned to a space shuttle in which some of the great scientific and medical advances of the future are being made and will be made. Cures for diabetes and heart disease may be possible up there; advances in technology and communication. And that's why I support the space shuttle. But my opponent personally led the fight against it and called it a horrible waste and tried to keep it from even being put into effect."", 'The truth is that my opponent\'s campaign, if it were a television show, it would be ""Let\'s Make a Deal."" [Laughter] You get to trade your prosperity for whatever is behind the curtain. If his campaign were a Broadway show, it would be ""Promises, Promises.""

They didn\'t reserve all their indignation for America.

The B-lB strategic bomber—two-thirds the size of the aging B-52, with twice the payload—and I've learned since I've been here I was wrong about that; it's 2 1/2 times the payload—with one one-hundredth of the radar cross section, and with the most advanced electronic defense system in the world-will keep America prepared for peace."", 'You know, those people who criticize and somehow think that in defending ourselves or having the weapons of defense that somehow that makes us warlike—I don\'t know whether you know this, but up at Fairchild air base, where I\'m going, up in the State of Washington, there\'s a sign over the gate that says, ""Peace is our profession.""', ""I'm delighted that just last week, the first production model successfully completed its initial flight. The readiness, the capability and resolve of our Armed Forces are the greatest guarantees we have that our young people will never again see the ugly face of war. There have been four wars in my lifetime. None of them started because America was too strong."", ""Earlier this year, on Memorial Day, America laid to rest the Unknown Soldier of Vietnam. A grateful nation opened its heart in gratitude for the sacrifices of those who have served. And a week later, on Omaha Beach, on the 40th anniversary of D-day, I spoke of Private First Class Robert Zanatta of the 37th Engineers, who was on the first assault wave to hit that beach. And on a nearby lonely, windswept point, we met the boys of Pointe du Hoc, the American Rangers, who more than 40 years ago took the cliffs and helped to end a war. And, you know, it gives me great joy to tell you that one of the men I met—one of those onetime boys of Pointe du Hoc—63 years old, on the day before I got there, with today's present Rangers, he climbed those cliffs again in 7 minutes just to see if he could do it."", 'But I made a pledge that day to always remember, to always be proud, and to always be prepared, so we may always be free. And I have no higher responsibility than to honor that pledge. No one, absolutely no one, should ever ask the sons and daughters of America to protect this land with less than the best equipment that we can provide.', ""If our sons and daughters can put their lives on the line to keep us free, then I believe it's immoral to give them anything less than all the tools, all the training and the equipment to do the job right. And it's up to us in this election to choose, and choose wisely, between a strong, safe America-an America at peace—or to slide back to the failed and dangerous policies of the past. There's no clearer issue in this campaign."", ""I don't question my opponent's patriotism and love of country. I only question his philosophy. He voted to delay or kill virtually every new strategic system—the B-1 bomber, the Trident submarine and Trident missile, the cruise missile, our ABM system, and the modernization of our ICBM force. And when it came to our conventional forces, the record was just as frightening, with votes to reduce U.S. ground forces overseas by 40 percent and to withdraw half of our military from Europe. When it came to aircraft, he voted to terminate the Navy's F-14 program, the Marines' Harrier, the A-7 for the Air National Guard, and to cut funds for the C-5 transport."", ""If it were up to my opponent, I'm afraid Rockwell might still be building the B-25—that is, if you were building anything at all. The truth is, if all his votes had prevailed, America would barely have any defense, any real means to protect the peace, any chance to preserve freedom. And we can't afford that kind of protection."", ""When my opponent joined the Carter-Mondale administration, he remained true to this record—$25 billion in defense budget cuts, naval shipbuilding programs slashed by half, Trident programs slowed down, military pay kept so low that our people couldn't wait to leave the service and, as you know all too well, the B-1 was cancelled."", ""Well, today candidate Mondale is promising more of the same. And when you add his promise of an $85 billion tax increase, you've got two promises that he's bound to keep."", 'Senator Glenn, a Democrat, summed it up pretty well: ""The Mondale record goes far beyond a simple disagreement over specific weapons programs. I think it reveals a fundamental lack of support for an adequate national defense."" I couldn\'t agree more. Mr. Mondale made a career out of weakening America\'s Armed Forces. Well, as long as I\'m in this job, we will not shortchange the security needs of America.', 'This hostility to a strong, secure America-an America at the leading edge of technology—was also demonstrated in his opposition to the space shuttle. He called it a horrible waste, a space extravaganza. My opponent was the acknowledged leader of the fraternity of pessimists in the Senate, voting time and again to delete funds for the shuttle and to reduce overall NASA funding.', ""Well, I believe there's never a time when we should stop dreaming and striving and moving forward. The footprints on the Moon reawakened us to mankind's boundless horizon and showed us that America's future can be determined by our dreams and by our visions. Together, we've opened new doors to discovery, opportunity, and progress."", ""The era of Apollo spawned communications, weather, navigation, and Earth resource satellites, and many new industries. America built a technological base second to none, and all the while, served the down-to-Earth needs of our people. And today, thanks to the work that you're doing here with the shuttle, we're pushing the frontiers of space back even farther, and we're going to keep on pushing."", ""As long as it's my watch—if a horse cavalryman of the past can speak in naval terms—we'll accept the challenge of space and keep battling for the future, for discovery, for new jobs and markets, and for knowledge. We have a promise to keep—to ourselves and to our young. And let me say of our young people, they are a shining generation."", ""Traveling across the country and seeing our high school and college students has been a wonderful experience, as well as seeing those who have already taken their first steps out here into the working world. They're bright. They're creative. They're idealistic. They have faith in themselves, faith in the future, and faith in America. And we must do all we can to see that the world they inherit from us is a world full of decency and daring as the world in which we were born."", ""You know, last night I got shut off because I ran out of time on my 4-minute finale. And I'm so delighted to see these young people who are here because what I wanted to say is that between my generation and theirs—there were a few of you in other generations in between—but all of us of those generations, our responsibility—we grew up in an America where we took it for granted that you could dream and make your dreams come true, if you set out to do that. And what we owe these young people—and they are very special—George Bush and I, as I said last night, have seen them all across this country—what we owe them is to see that we turn over to them the same kind of America of hope and opportunity that our parents turned over to us. And that's what we're going to do."", 'To give our future a chance, we must keep moving forward in new frontiers in science, technology, and space. And to give peace a chance to grow and settle in, we must remain strong. And those who have no vision of the future have no business leading America. And those who believe a weaker America is a safer America have no business guiding the destiny of our nation.', ""In 1981 we went to work repairing the damage caused by wrong-headed thinking. And besides working to restore the strategic balance, we started to rebuild our conventional forces. And today every major commander in the field agrees that America's military forces have better people, who are better armed, better trained, better motivated, with better support behind them."", ""If we were to stop now in midstream, we'd send a signal of decline, lessened will, and weakness to friends and adversaries alike. If we were to return to the time when we modernized our defenses in fits and starts, each time losing the security we gained earlier, then we would never be certain of our security. We'd never be able to convince the Soviet leadership that it is in their interest to sit down and negotiate equitable arms reductions. And the American people know it."", ""It's always easy to argue for reductions in defense spending, just as it's easy to pretend that one can call the Soviet leaders, as my opponent has proposed, and persuade them in a moment to alter the course they've followed for decades. It's also nonsense, and the American people know it."", ""There is no quick, easy way. The solution is firmness and patience. The only sensible and safe route is to make sure that we're prepared to defend freedom and prepared for peace. And the American people know that, too."", 'From our earliest years, our Presidents have stressed the crucial role of preparedness in promoting peace and stability. George Washington said, ""There\'s nothing so likely to produce peace as to be well prepared to meet a foe."" Harry Truman said, ""The will for peace without the strength for peace is of no avail."" And John Kennedy said, ""The primary purpose of our arms is peace, not war. Our preparation against danger is our hope for safety.""', ""Now, my opponents can't stand it when I start talking about Harry Truman or J.F.K.—I need to remind them that Harry Truman was the last Democrat I voted and campaigned for—but of course they can't, because it just shows them how far the leadership today of the Democratic Party has strayed from the great strengths of the Democratic political tradition. And nowhere is the drift more evident than in their unwillingness to keep us prepared for peace. And I think the American people know that."", 'Four years ago, our nation chose the road of peace through strength—a road built upon a realistic understanding of the world around us and the continuing faith in the American values. And 15 days from now, it will again be a time for choosing. We can be confident because we trust the American people.', ""And in view of some of the things that were said last night—to those of you that saw that—you hear about the bad relations that we now have between ourselves and the Soviet Union. Last year we sold them 23 million tons of grain, and our farmers benefited accordingly. And in the 4 years that we've been here, they haven't advanced by 1 square inch of territory anyplace in the world."", ""I know that I've been talking partisan politics, and I know that in a crowd like this there must be thousands of people who are Democrats. And I'm delighted, having been one for most of my life, because I know that all across this country there are millions of patriotic, dedicated Democrats who know they can no longer follow in the path of the leadership of their party, which has taken us down such strange paths, so foreign to what the leadership of the Democratic Party once believed."", ""Well, join us, and in a bipartisan way we'll make this country the way it should be.

But I\'m told that your city has had an interesting history with regard to names; that when the first settlers came here from the East, they saw its possibilities as a beautiful port. They cleared the area around here, cut down the trees, and made a tomahawk claim of the area. And then they chose to call it their own. And one of the main setters insisted the city be called Boston. Another insisted it be called Portland, after Portland, Maine. And they settled it in a very gentlemanly manner. They flipped a coin. [Laughter] And so, Portland was born.', ""I'm involved, as you probably have heard, in kind of a contest now. It won't be settled by the toss of a coin— [laughter] —it'll be settled by the wisdom of good people like yourselves."", ""As your Governor told you—and I've been thinking, too, of what has been accomplished in these past 4 years, and what we had to overcome to get where we are. And it reminded me that in 1862 Abe Lincoln gave us some enduring advice. Abe Lincoln said, we must disenthrall ourselves with the past—and then we will save our country. Well, 4 years ago, that's what we did. We made a great turn. We got out from under the thrall of a government which we had hoped would make our lives better, but which wound up living our lives for us."", 'The power of the Federal Government had, over the decades, created great chaos—economic chaos, social chaos, international chaos.', 'Audience member.

Just before we took office, my opponent said our economic program is obviously, murderously inflationary. Now, that was just before we lowered inflation from above 12 percent to 4 percent.', 'Then, just after our tax cuts, he said the most that he could see was an anemic recovery; and that was right before our economy created more than 6 million new jobs in 21 months and just before a record nearly 900,000 businesses were incorporated in less than a year and a half.', ""Now, my opponent said that our policies would deliver a misery index the likes of which we haven't seen for a long time. Well, now, there was some truth in that. You know, you get the misery index by adding up the unemployment rate and the inflation rate. Now, they invented that for the 1976 campaign. And they said that Jerry Ford had no right to seek reelection, because his misery index was 12.6. Now, they didn't mention the misery index in the 1980 campaign, because it had gone up to more than 20 percent. And they aren't talking too much about it in this campaign, because it's down around 11."", 'Now, my opponent said that decontrol of oil prices would cost American consumers more than $36 billion a year.

And the prices are still headed down.', ""Now, you know, it's just occurred to me that maybe all we have to do to get the economy absolutely in perfect shape is to get my opponent to predict absolute disaster.

And the United States is more secure than we were 4 years ago."", 'Yet there\'s so much more to say about my opponent. His grasp of foreign affairs is demonstrated by the following: Sometime back, he said the old days of a Soviet strategy of suppression by force are over—that was just before the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia. And after they invaded Afghanistan, he said, ""It just baffles me why the Soviets these last few years have behaved as they have."" But then there\'s so much that baffles him.', ""One year ago we liberated Grenada from Communist thugs, and my opponent called what we did a violation of international law that erodes our moral authority to criticize the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

Unfortunately, they didn't punish the Soviets; they punished the American farmers."", 'My opponent supported the grain embargo and spoke out for it often. He even questioned the patriotism of a Senator from his own party when that Senator called that embargo just what it was—unworkable and unfair. But now he seems to have changed his tune. He says he privately opposed the embargo-very privately. As a matter of fact, he has, in the last several months, claimed that he opposed a number of the administration policies when he was Vice President. He was a real thorn in their side. But as Jody Powell, who was also a member of that administration, said, ""I guess I was out of the room every time it happened.""', 'And after the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua, he praised it, saying, ""Winds of democratic progress are stirring where they have long been stifled."" But we know that the Sandinistas immediately began to persecute the genuine believers in democracy and to export terror. They went on to slaughter the Miskito Indians, abuse and deport church leaders, slander the Pope, practice anti-Semitism, and move to kill free speech. So, why isn\'t my opponent speaking out now?', 'More recently, he failed to repudiate the Reverend Jesse Jackson when he went to Havana, stood with Fidel Castro, and cried: ""Long live Cuba! Long live President Fidel Castro! Long live Che Guevara!""', ""I could say of his economic program that he will either have to break his promises or break the bank.

But I won't say that, because Fritz Hollings, a Democrat, has already said that."", ""Now, if on political issues my opponent dares to be wrong, on domestic policy issues he has the courage to be cautious. A lineitem veto would help control wild government spending and end some of the porkbarreling that goes on. I had a line-item veto as Governor of California. Your Governor has a line-item veto. Forty-two other Governors in this country have line-item vetoes. But my opponent says that's not part of the liberal agenda. So, a line-item veto will not be used to help that wild spending."", ""He has long opposed enterprise zones. This was a program we introduced to help the. most economically troubled neighborhoods like some in our great inner cities. It was to use tax incentives and to stimulate the economy in those areas. And he's opposed that. But then a few weeks ago, he said that now he's for them. Well, if he's for them, why doesn't he ask Tip O'Neill to get out of the way and loosen the program that's been buried in a committee in the House for over a year?"", ""Changed signals a little bit—this month an American woman walked in space-Kathryn Sullivan made history. And then she returned to a space shuttle in which some of the great scientific and medical advances of the future will be made. Already we're learning that it's possible—or it looks possible—that we're going to have cures for diabetes and heart disease—that are to be able to develop them up there in the shuttle-advances in technology and communication. That's why I support the space shuttle. But my opponent personally led the fight in the Senate against having the shuttle program at all.

He even questioned the patriotism of a Senator from his own party when that Senator called that embargo just what it was—unworkable and unfair. But now he seems to have changed his tune. He says he privately opposed the embargo—very privately.

When we talk about Scoop Jackson we\'re reminded that, above all, politics is about principles, and Senator Jackson had among the strongest principles of anyone I\'ve known. The first of those principles was that politics stopped at the water\'s edge. Time and again he provided the key leadership essential to preserving our nation\'s interests.', ""Not all of Scoop's colleagues took the same course. Indeed, my opponent almost always voted just the opposite when it came to maintaining the strength of the United States. In 1970, as measured by the national security index of the American Security Council, Senator Jackson had a rating of 80 on key issues, while Mr. Mondale had a zero. In 1972 Scoop again scored 80; Mr. Mondale again, zero. In 1974 and again in 1976, Henry Jackson scored 90, while Mr. Mondale scored zero and then managed to get an 11. [Laughter] Now, whether it's the old math or the new math, the bottom line is the same. On nearly every occasion the Senator, Henry Jackson, east a vote for America's defense.

But he doesn't tell the American people that Brzezinski, Mr. Carter's and Mr. Mondale's own national security adviser, has called this a nuclear hoax that is not achievable and not verifiable."", 'Is it any wonder that my opponent\'s Democratic colleague, Senator Fritz Hollings, has said, ""Walter Mondale thinks the Soviet Union would never violate an arms agreement. I think he\'s naive.""

You could rise as high and far as your own strength would take you. And this is the responsibility of all those several generations I mentioned, other than yours, the younger generation.

Vote for growth and opportunity by sending John Raese to the United States Senate."", ""You know, the Senate is one key to continuing what we've begun. West Virginia has a fine tradition for rising above partisanship when the national interest calls, a tradition that's well represented by your retiring Senator, Jennings Randolph. John Raese has the qualities of leadership necessary to continue that tradition and to do what's best and what's right for America. I need-and I think your State needs, if you'll permit me—John Raese in the United States Senate."", ""Jim, Cleve, and John are great candidates, and they'll make even better representatives in Washington, so please send them there."", ""You know, I'm always happy when I visit this part of the country because—maybe because you make me feel so much at home.

And they invented it so that they could say Jerry Ford had no right to run for reelection, because he had a misery index of 12.6. Well, now, they didn't mention the misery index in the election of 1980, probably because it was over 20.

But then, there\'s so much that baffles him. [Laughter]', ""Just 1 year ago we liberated Grenada from Communist thugs who had taken over that country.

He told me a story about his first sermon. He had been ordained a minister, and then he was invited to preach at a little country church. And he worked for weeks on that first sermon. And he went out there, and he stood up in the pulpit and looked out at the church, and there was only one lone little fellow sitting out there in the otherwise empty pews. And he went down, and he said, ""Look, my friend, I\'m just a young preacher getting started. You seem to be the only member of the congregation that showed up. Should I go through with it?""

If I loaded up a truckload of hay and took it out in the prairie, and only one cow showed up, I\'d feed her."" So, he got back up in the pulpit, took that as a cue, and an hour and a half later went down and said, ""My friend, you seem to have stuck with me. What did you think?"" And he said, ""Well, like I told you, I don\'t know much about that sort of thing, but I do know this. If I loaded up a truckload of hay, took it out in the prairie, and only one cow showed up, I sure as hell wouldn\'t give her the whole load.""

63,Ronald Reagan ,"November 02, 1984","[""The President. Thank you, you all, for a heartwarming reception and what, in a way, is homecoming for me. Governor Thompson and ladies and gentlemen, it's great to be back in Illinois, and it's an honor to be back in the proud town of Springfield, your State capital and the home of Abraham Lincoln. Now, no matter what you may have heard, it isn't true that I knew him personally. [Laughter]"", 'I might add that as we meet here in central Illinois, our Secretary of Agriculture is hard at work spreading the message in southern Illinois.', 'In 1861, just before beginning the long train journey east to become President, Abraham Lincoln stood near this spot and spoke to the people of this good town. He said, ""A duty devolves upon me which is perhaps greater than that which is devolved upon any other man since the days of Washington."" It was the duty of making certain, as Mr. Lincoln would later say at Gettysburg, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and a government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth.', ""Well, ever since taking office, we've worked hard to restore government of the people, to give this blessed land a new birth of freedom and opportunity. Believe me, we couldn't have accomplished all that we have without the help of your outstanding Senator, Chuck Percy. Since 1967 Chuck has served in the United States Senate with dedication and skill. He has stood proudly for the people of Illinois, and he's worked tirelessly to help keep America strong, proud, and prosperous."", ""Now, you've got some other candidates around here, too, and I'll be talking about those in a minute. But during the past 4 years—let me continue with Chuck—he's worked to rebuild our nation's defenses, to bring your taxes down. And today, I'm running against an opponent who wants to raise your taxes, and so is Chuck running against that kind of an opponent. The difference is, while Mr. Mondale wants to hike your taxes, it seems that Mr. Simon wants to raise them even more than Mr. Mondale does. A vote for Mr. Mondale and Mr. Simon is a vote for failed policies of higher taxes, higher prices, and a weak defense."", ""But, you know, I believe and I think you'll agree, a vote for our team with Chuck Percy is a vote for America's future. So, if you plan to vote for me, please don't vote— [applause] . Well, but all right— [applause] —but please—all right—"", 'Audience. 4 more years! 4 more years! 4 more years!', ""The President. That's what I came here to talk to you about. All right."", 'Audience. 4 more years! 4 more years! 4 more years!', ""The President. Well, all right. But in a way, you'd be voting against me if you voted for Chuck's opponent. So, don't do that. I need Chuck back in Washington, and so do the people of Illinois."", ""Your candidates, well, you've got a Congressman, Ed Madigan, and your candidates for the House, Ken McMillan and Randy Patchett and Dick Austin and my close friend and trusted adviser, Bob Michel-they're just as distinguished and just as committed to a future of low taxes, opportunity, and economic growth. So, please help spread the word. Get out the vote, and please win these votes—or these races for the Gipper. And if you do, we can keep building our new future of opportunities for America."", ""You know, Abe Lincoln said we must disenthrall ourselves with the past—and then we will save our country. Well, 4 years ago, that's what we did. We made a great turn. We got out from under the thrall of a government which we had hoped would make our lives better, but which wound up trying to live our lives for us. Four years ago, we began to navigate by certain fixed principles. Our North Star was freedom, and common sense our constellations."", 'We knew that economic freedom meant paying less of the American family\'s earnings to the government. And so, we cut personal income tax rates by 25 percent. And that was across the board. That wasn\'t any favor for some particular segment of our society. It was ""even-Steven"" all the way.', ""You know, my opponent's been talking a lot about business taxes, and he says that there's been thousands of businesses making profits that are not paying a single penny in taxes. Well, you know, that's true. There are provisions in the tax laws that allow for in vestment for increased production and things of that kind. But I'm surprised that he didn't mention that in the 4 years of Carter-Mondale, there was an average of 387,000 corporations a year that didn't pay any taxes, even though they'd made a profit. So, I don't know why he's just discovered that that goes on now."", 'But we knew then that inflation, the quiet thief, and record interest rates were stealing our future.', ""We knew that our national military defense had been weakened. So, we decided to rebuild and be strong again, to be prepared for peace. It was a second American revolution, and it's only just begun."", ""But America is back, a giant on the scene, powerful in its renewed spirit, powerful in its growing economy, and powerful in its ability to defend itself and secure the peace. And do you know something? That's not debatable."", 'Yet 4 years after our efforts began, small voices in the night are sounding the call to go back—to go back to the days of drift, back to the days of torpor, timidity, and taxes.', ""My opponent's understanding of economics is well demonstrated by his predictions. Just before we took office, he said our economic program is obviously, murderously inflationary. And right after he said that, we lowered inflation from above 12 percent to down around 4."", 'And then, just after our tax cuts were voted, and he said the most he could see was an anemic recovery. That was right before the United States economy created more than 6 million new jobs in 21 months.', 'My opponent said decontrol of oil prices would cost American consumers more than $36 billion. Well, one of the first things we did was decontrol the oil prices, and the price of gasoline went down 8 cents a gallon.', 'Maybe all we have to do to get the economy in absolutely perfect shape is persuade him to predict absolute disaster.', 'He says he cares about the middle class. But he boasts, ""I have consistently supported legislation, time after time, which increases taxes on my own constituents."" Doesn\'t that make you just want to be one of his constituents? [Laughter] He\'s no doubt proud of the fact that as a United States Senator he voted to increase your taxes 16 times.Audience member. [Inaudible]—like hell!', ""The President. You said it all.

Okay. All right.', 'Audience. 4 more years! 4 more years! 4 more years!', 'The President. All right. I can take it if you can.', ""But now my opponent has promised, of course, to raise your taxes. But if he's to keep all the promises that he's made in this campaign, he'll have to raise taxes by the equivalent of $1,890 for every household in the United States.Audience. Boo-o-o!"", ""The President. Now, that comes down to more than $150 a month. That's like a second mortgage, a Mondale mortgage. [Laughter]"", ""His economic plan has two basic parts, too: raise your taxes, and the second part is raise them again. [Laughter] But I've got news for him: The American people don't want his tax increases, and he isn't going to get his tax increases."", 'Audience. Reagan-Bush! Reagan-Bush! Reagan-Bush!The President. All right. All right.', 'Audience. Reagan-Bush! Reagan-Bush! Reagan-Bush!', ""The President. All right. Reagan-Bush, we're a package."", 'His tax plan would bring our recovery to a roaring stop.', 'You know, if my opponent\'s campaign were a television show, it would be ""Let\'s Make a Deal."" [Laughter] You trade your prosperity for what he\'s got hidden behind the curtain. And if his administration were a play on Broadway, it would be ""Promises, Promises."" And if it were a book, a novel, you\'d have to read it from the front to the back in order to get a happy ending.', ""I reversed that. You'd have to read it from the back to the front. [Laughter] Well, forgive me, I've been going since early this morning. I sabotaged myself right there. [Laughter]"", ""He sees an America in which every day is tax day, April 15th. We see an America in which every day is Independence Day, the Fourth of July. We want to lower your taxes, yours and everyone's in this country, so that your families will be stronger, our economy will be stronger, and America will be stronger."", ""I'm proud to say that during these last 4 years—this is on a change of subject—not 1 square inch of territory anyplace in the world has been lost to Communist aggression. And the United States is more secure than it was 4 years ago."", 'But my opponent sees a different world. After the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, he said, ""It just baffles me why the Soviets, these last few years, have behaved as they have."" You know, there\'s so much that baffles him. [Laughter]', 'One year ago we liberated Grenada from Communist thugs who had taken over that country. My opponent called what we did a violation of international law that erodes our moral authority to criticize the Soviets. Well, there is nothing immoral about rescuing American students whose lives are in danger.', 'Let me put this in perspective. The 1984 election isn\'t just a partisan contest. I was a Democrat once myself, and for a great share of my life. But in those days—in those days, its leaders weren\'t the ""blame America first"" crowd. Its leaders were men like Harry Truman and, later, men like Senator Scoop Jackson, John F. Kennedy. They understood the challenge of their times. They didn\'t reserve all their indignation for America. They knew the difference between freedom and tyranny, and they stood up to the one and damned the other.', ""Now, to all the good Democrats—and I'm sure there must be many of you in this crowd, and I hope so—there have been in the rallies all across this country millions of patriotic Democrats who can no longer follow the policies of the leadership of that party. Well, you are not alone. Come and walk with us down this path of hope and opportunity. And in the finest tradition of America, we will have a bipartisan effort to keep this country free and prosperous and secure."", ""Last month, an American woman made history—Kathryn Sullivan walked in space. And then she returned to the shuttle in which some of the great scientific and medical advances of the future will be made. Cures for diabetes and heart disease may be possible up there, advances in technology and communication. I have seen some of the evidence already of the experiments in the shuttles with regard to those cures I mentioned. But my opponent led the fight in the United States Senate against the entire shuttle program and called it a horrible waste. Well, we support the space shuttle. And we've committed America to meet a great challenge—to build a permanently manned space station, and to do it within a decade."", ""Now, I've probably been going on too long here, but the point is.Audience.

[Laughter]"", 'Audience. 4 more years! 4 more years! 4 more years!', 'The President. All right. Thank you. But the point is, we made the right move when we made our great turn in 1980. We were right to take command of the ship, to stop its aimless drift, and to get moving again. And we were right when we stopped sending out S.O.S. and started saying U.S.A.!Audience. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!', 'The President. Yes. And the United States of America was never meant to be a second-best nation.

Well, we're going to keep raising those scores and restore American academic excellence, second to none."", ""Our crackdown on crime produced the sharpest drop in the history of the crime index last year. We're going to keep cracking down until you and your families and your friends can walk our city streets without being afraid."", ""We've reversed the decline in our military defenses and restored respect for America. And we're going to keep this nation strong to protect freedom and peace for us, for our children, and for our children's children."", ""And in this city, where you so often see those in uniform and our military, I just have to tell you, of all the things I've been proud of in this job, nothing has made me more proud than the magnificent young men and women who are in the uniform of our military service."", 'And if we make sure that America remains strong and prepared for peace, then we can begin to reduce nuclear weapons and, one day, banish them from the Earth entirely.', 'My opponent has been talking about a nuclear freeze. And now and then, in a kind of an unfriendly way, some people shove signs in my face—""Nuclear Freeze."" Well, when we can reduce Soviet and American weapons down to an equal and verifiable limit that there is no disadvantage to us, yes, then we\'ll have a nuclear freeze.', 'And as we strengthen our economy, strengthen our security, and strengthen the values that bind us, America will become a nation even greater in its standard of living, in its art, in its learning, and greater in the love and worship of the God who made us and who has blessed us as no other people have ever been blessed.', ""Now, a couple of weeks ago I ran out of time on the debate. I didn't get to finish what I had set out to say. I'm going to say it here. And to many of you, if you'll forgive me, this is directed to our young people who are here with us today. [Applause]"", ""All right. You are what this election is all about—you and your future. I've seen you all over this country, on campuses, as I said earlier, and universities and in high schools and out in rallies such as this. Your generation really sparkles. Your idealism and love of country are unsurpassed."", 'Now my generation—and there are several more between mine and yours— [laughter] —all of us, or most of us, grew up in an America where we took it for granted that we could dream and make our dreams come true, fly as high and far as our ability and effort would take us.', ""Then we came to a time not too long ago when people began telling us that those days were over, that we were in an era of limits, that there was a ceiling, and we never again could have things quite as good as they had been. Well, don't you believe it."", ""My generation, and those other generations I mentioned, we have a sacred trust-and we're going to fill that trust. And that is to see that when the time comes to turn the reins over to you, we're going to turn over to you a country that is free in a world that is at peace. And it will be a country in which you can dare to dream and know that you can make your dreams come true."", ""All of us together are just part of a great revolution, and it's a revolution that's only just begun. America will never go—give up, will never go back—never. We were born to be a special place between the two great oceans, with a unique mission to carry freedom's message. To a tired, disillusioned world, we have always been a light of hope where all things are possible.Audience. We love Reagan!"", 'The President. And throughout my life-thank you—I have seen—Audience member. [Inaudible]', ""The President. I've seen in my lifetime America do the impossible—I do, too."", 'We survived, when I was a young man, a Great Depression, a worldwide depression that toppled governments in many parts of the world, but not ours. We came back from Pearl Harbor to win the greatest military victory in the history of the world. And in a single lifetime, my lifetime, we have gone from the horse and buggy to landing astronauts on the Moon.', ""As a people, we have fought harder, paid a higher price, done more to advance the freedom and dignity of man than any other people on Earth. Ours is the land of the free because it's the home of the brave. And our future will always be great because our nation will be strong. And our nation will be strong because our people are free. And our people will be free because we're united—one people, under God, with liberty and justice for all."", ""Here we're about to end the 1984 campaign. And I want to tell you, having stood here, as I said, 4 years ago, at this particular point—same point in that campaign—I'm deeply honored that you made the decision 4 years ago and allowed me to serve you for these past 4 years. Nancy and I will be forever grateful to all of you. But much remains to be done. We must continue to build on the new beginning that we started 4 years ago."", ""So, I've come here asking for your vote, asking for your support. But— [applause] . All right. But, also, I don't want to be sent back there alone. These other people I mentioned up here, the incumbent office. holders, Members of the House, the candidates. Send them back there with us, so that as a team we can carry on."", ""And now, just one last request—one last request. Don't read the polls. Don't get complacent. The last time I looked at Mount Rushmore, President Dewey's face wasn't up there. [Laughter] We need every vote, so make up your mind your vote is needed, Get out there and vote. Get your neighbors to vote. Go to the polls tomorrow.Our best days are yet to come."", ""And now, for the last time in the campaign that I can say it—because I know it drives a certain candidate up the wall—I'm going to say it, and that is, you ain't seen nothin' yet.""]"

It seems we did this 4 years ago, and let me just say, well, you know, good habits are hard to break.', 'Just a short time ago, Walter Mondale phoned me, and to—', 'Audience. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. No—to concede. He told me the people had made their decision and, therefore, we were all Americans, we'd go forward together."", 'But Nancy and I would like to express-', 'Audience. Nancy! Nancy! Nancy!', ""The President. They're yelling for you. They're yelling for you. Nancy, Nancy."", 'Audience. Nancy! Nancy! Nancy!', 'Mrs. Reagan. Thank you.', 'The President. Nancy thanks you.', ""You know, we could spend the rest of the next 4 years thanking all of those who have made this night possible. But there are a few I'd like to mention this evening. First, Nancy and I want to express our warmth and our deep gratitude to George and Barbara Bush."", 'Audience. Bush! Bush! Bush!', ""The President. And, George, if you're watching down there in Texas, thank you for campaigning so magnificently all across this country. And believe me, I'm very proud to have you as my partner for this next term. As far as I'm concerned, there has never been a finer Vice President."", ""And a thank you, too, to Paul Laxalt, our campaign chairman. Paul is in Washington, and I understand he's there watching in a room like this with people like yourself who are there for the same reason. And there is no better personal friend than I've ever had, and there's no better ally to have at your side when you're in a campaign."", ""And, Paul, we're grateful for all that you've done over the years. And all of you there in the Shoreham Hotel ballroom, a deep thanks for all that you have done."", 'And Paul would be the first to say how much help he had and what an outstanding job was done by Ed Rollins, our campaign director. And, Ed, please know how grateful I am for the way you put together the finest campaign organization, I think, in the history of American politics.', 'Our thanks, too, to Mayor Margaret Hance, our deputy campaign chairwoman. She gave of her time so generously.', ""Back in Washington, we owe so much to the great work of the Republican National Committee and its chairman, Frank Fahrenkopf. Frank and all those dedicated people who worked with him gave—well, they give politics a good name. We wouldn't have enjoyed this victory tonight without them."", ""And now, I have a special thank you for something that began here in this State almost 20 years ago. First by the dozens, and then by the hundreds, and finally by the thousands, we've seen our friends, all of you volunteers and workers who came to our side to help. From California, then across the United States, you have each given selflessly of yourselves. And I have no Words to properly thank you for all that you've done."", 'We set out, I remember back those almost 20 years ago, and said that we could start a prairie fire here in California, one that would capture the intensity of our devotion to freedom and the strength of our commitment to American ideals.', ""Well, we began to carry a message to every corner of the Nation, a simple message. The message is: Here in America, the people are in charge. And that's really why we're here tonight. This electoral victory belongs to you and the principles that you cling to—principles struck by the brilliance and bravery of patriots more than 200 years ago. They set forth the course of liberty and hope that makes our country special in the world. To the extent that what has happened today reaffirms those principles, we are part of that prairie fire that we still think defines America—a fire of hope that will keep alive the promise of opportunity as we head into the next century."", 'Four years ago, when we celebrated victory in this same room, our country was faced by some deep and serious problems. But instead of complaining together, we rolled up our sleeves and began working together.', ""We said we would get inflation under control, and we did. We said we would get America working again, and we've created more than 6 1/2 million new jobs. We said that we would work to restore traditional values in our society, and we have begun. And we said that we would slow down the growth of government and the rate of its spending increases, and we did. We said we'd get interest rates down, and we did. We said we would rebuild our defenses and make America prepared for peace, and we have."", 'Now, I wish I could take credit for this, but—', 'Audience. Yes!', 'The President.—but the credit—no, the credit belongs to the American people, to each of you.', ""Our work isn't finished; there's much more to be done. We want to make every family more secure, to help those in our inner cities, on our farms, and in some of our older industries which are not yet back on their feet. And the recovery will not be complete until it's complete for everyone."", 'By rebuilding our strength, we can bring ourselves closer to the day when all nations can begin to reduce nuclear weapons and ultimately banish them from the Earth entirely.', 'You know, so many people act as if this election means the end of something—', 'Audience. No!', ""The President. The vision we outlined in 1980, indeed the passion of the fire that we kept burning for two decades, doesn't die just because 4 years have passed. To each one of you I say: Tonight is the end of nothing; it's the beginning of everything."", 'Audience. 4 more years! 4 more years! 4 more years!', 'The President. All right.', 'Audience. 4 more years! 4 more years! 4 more years!', ""The President. All right. Okay. All right. What we've done only prepares us for what we're going to do. We must continue-not only into those next 4 years but into the next decade and the next century-to meet our goal of sustained economic growth without inflation and to keep America strong."", 'Our society is a society of unlimited opportunity which will reach out to every American and includes lifting the weak and nurturing the less fortunate.', ""We fought many years for our principles. Now we'll work to keep those principles in practice. That's what we have to leave to our children, and to their children, and they are what this campaign was all about."", ""We've come together again. We're united again. And now, let's start building together and keep the prairie fire alive. And let's never stop shaping that society which lets each person's dreams unfold into a life of unending hope. America's best days lie ahead. And, you know, you'll forgive me, I'm going to do it just one more time: You ain't seen nothin' yet."", 'God bless you. Thank you all very much. Thank you.']"
