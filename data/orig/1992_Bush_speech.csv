0,George Bush ,"November 01, 1992","['The President. Thank you. Thank you all. What a fantastic rally. Four more.', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', 'The President. Thank you all. Thank you so very much. What a great welcome back to Connecticut. Thank you very much. Thank you very, very much for that warm welcome back. And to all of you inside and the 10,000 outside, thanks for that welcome back.', ""May I start by saluting our great congressional delegation, the Members of Congress, Chris Shays, Gary Franks, and Nancy Johnson. We've got a great delegation. And now help them clean House by electing more to the United States Congress. We need Brook Johnson, we need Tom Scott, we need Phil Steele, we need Edward Munster all to go to Washington."", 'I salute John Rowland, our emcee. I thank Paul Overstreet and the Gunsmoke for the great music. And let me thank the others that made this great rally possible, Doc Gunther, Betsy Heminway, Brian Gaffney, Dick Foley, and Fred Biebel -- came to Connecticut in late 1988 just before the election. We won then, and we are going to win now and annoy the media.', 'Audience members. Bush! Bush! Bush!', 'The President. I am very grateful to all of you, and I thank my brother Pres for the introduction. The choice before the American people this year is very different, a vast difference in experience, a vast difference in philosophy, and a vast difference in character. And we are going to win on all three.', ""There's another collateral reason, not nearly as important, but people are beginning to take a look or have already looked at the record in Arkansas. And without ruining a fantastically upbeat rally, let me just click off a couple of numbers for you. I think of Connecticut as an environmentally sound State. Arkansas is the 50th in the quality of environmental initiative. They are 50 in the percentage of adults with college degrees."", 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. I don\'t want to ruin the evening, only a few more here. They are 50th in per capita spending on criminal justice. They are 49th in per capita spending on police protection. They are 48th in the percentage of adults with a high school diploma. They are 48th in the spending on corrections. They are 46 on teachers\' salaries. They are 45th in the overall well-being of children. And Clinton has said, ""I want to do for America what I\'ve done for Arkansas."" No way! Governor Clinton, we do not need that kind of change in this country.', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', 'The President. We got it.', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. For a long time, the Governor's been running around talking about change. Well, let's take a look at what he's already proposed: $150 billion in new taxes, $220 billion in new spending. You talk about trickle-down Government, that's it. His numbers don't add up. And as I say to the middle class, he says he's going to sock it to the rich, but everybody that's got a job, every teacher, every cab driver, every farmer, watch your wallet. The guy's coming after you, and we're not going to let him do that."", 'Change, change, change, change, that\'s all he talks about. Remember what it was like when we had a Democrat in the White House and a Democratic liberal leadership in the Congress? You had inflation at 15 percent; you had interest rates at 21 percent; you had the ""misery index"" at 20. And we are not going back to that kind of change. Change, that\'s all you\'ll have left in your pocket if we go his route, I\'ll tell you. [Laughter]', ""You know, the bad news for Governor Clinton is that there's been some good news for our economy. The economy grew at 2.7 percent. It's grown for six quarters. Clinton and the Ozone Man tell you that we are worse off. They tell you that we're worse off than Japan and Germany. We're not. We've been in an economic international slowdown. It is the United States of America, with knowledgeable leadership on international affairs and increasing our exports, that's going to lead the way to new recovery. And the answer to it is not tax and spend but hold the line on taxes and put a cap on the growth of these mandatory spending programs and then stimulate small business, investment tax allowance, capital gains to get people to start new businesses, a credit for that first-time homebuyer that wants to live the American dream. That's the way to do it, not bigger Government."", ""I have a responsibility as the Commander in Chief and in charge of the national security to be sure we don't cut into the muscle of the defense. Because we've been successful with world peace and because we've stayed strong and made some tough decisions, I've been able to cut defense. But now along comes Governor Clinton, and he wants to cut the muscle of our defense $60 billion more. We cannot let him do that. And besides that, besides the national security, we don't need to throw an additional 1 million people out of work, including 9,500 right here in Connecticut. So we are going to hold the line and keep this country secure, because who knows where the next threat is coming to. We'd better have a leader that understands international affairs."", ""You know, Connecticut is a great trading State. We've got some of the best made products in the world right here by Connecticut workers. And what we're going to do is expand our exports. Exports have saved us at a critical time, and we are going to create more American jobs by increasing exports, by increasing free and fair trade."", ""I mentioned small business. You know, small business creates about two-thirds -- has about two-thirds of the jobs. I don't want to slap a tax on them for any reason. What I want to do is give them less taxes, less regulation, and less litigation, fewer of these crazy lawsuits, so we can move small business ahead and create jobs for everyone in Connecticut that needs jobs."", 'I mentioned legal reform. We\'re having a big battle in Congress. We must put a cap on some of these outrageous lawsuits. You know, when a Little League coach says, ""Hey, it\'s not worth it; I don\'t want to get sued by somebody""; when a person along the highway sees somebody that\'s been hurt and hesitates to help his or her fellow man because they\'re afraid of getting sued; and when we\'ve got baby doctors that refuse to deliver them because they\'re afraid of malpractice, it is time to stand up to Governor Clinton and the trial lawyers and do something about it. I think the bottom line is we ought to sue each other less and care for each other more in the United States.', ""Health care: we've got the best health care plan. The first thing we don't need is what Governor Clinton wants, is a big Government board to ration health care. What I want to do is provide insurance to the poorest of the poor through vouchers. I want to give the next tax bracket up a break with some tax credits. We want to pool the insurance so everybody can get the benefit of a lower premium for these ever-increasing insurance costs. Then I want to keep the Government from mandating prices. I want to keep the Government out of the business, because we've got the best health care quality in the entire world."", ""And education: we've got a great program, America 2000. It's beginning to work, 1,700 to 2,000 communities across this country already sitting down, the teachers, the parents, the school boards, to literally revolutionize education in this country. I believe that parents ought to have a right to choose the school of their choice, public, private, or religious, and get some help from the Government. It's been tried, and where it's tried it works. It works. And those schools that aren't chosen do a better job. It worked for the GI bill. It is separation of church and state. Let's try something new in this country. Let's help these young kids have the best education possible."", ""Welfare reform: we've got to break the back of welfare dependency. We've been working with the States to give them waivers so they can try learnfare or workfare and try to help people get off of welfare. And we can do it. But we've got to do it by giving waivers to the States and reforming our welfare system."", ""I've got a big difference on Governor Clinton on crime. You know, in Arkansas prisoners spend 20 percent of their sentences and that's all; Federal Government, it is 85 percent of their sentences in jail. It's my firm belief that we need to back up our police officers more. We need to have a little more compassion for the victims of crime and a little less for the criminal element. Thank God for the local police that are out there standing up against these drug and criminal elements. Our police officers are trying to make our neighborhoods safer. And the other day I was endorsed by eight people, came up from Arkansas, and they were the Fraternal Order of Police from Little Rock, to endorse me for President of the United States."", 'I wish we had more Members of Congress like the ones -- --', 'Audience members. Bush! Bush! Bush!', ""The President. I wish we had more Members of Congress like the ones here who care about the Federal deficit. And here's some ideas for getting it down. Give us a balanced budget amendment to discipline the Congress and the President. Give us a taxpayer check-off so you, the voters, can say -- if the thing that concerns you the most is the deficit, you can check off 10 percent of your tax return and compel the Congress to bring that spending down to meet that contribution. Then if the liberal leadership in the Congress can't do it, and they haven't been able to do it, why don't we give the President what 43 Governors have: Give him the line-item veto, and let the President draw a line through these pork barrel projects."", ""And now let's talk about what people are going to decide on, in addition to who's got the best program and who has the best record on world peace. Let me tell you this: I see these kids here, and I take great pride that our administration did an awful lot to help eliminate the fear of nuclear weapons from the minds of these kids. That is major. That is significant."", ""But now let's talk about character and trust. Over the past few days you've seen Governor Clinton kind of panic, afraid that the power for which he has lusted -- do you remember when he wrote back from Oxford, when he was over there organizing demonstrations against this country when his country was at war? Do you remember that? In the letter to Colonel Holmes, he said something about protecting his political viability. Well, we are going to give his political viability a chance to mature a little more in Arkansas, because he is not going to win the Presidency."", 'Do you remember that old expression ""Sticks and stones hurt your bones, but names will never hurt you?"" He called me a liar the other day, but that doesn\'t hurt. It\'s like being called ugly by a frog. It doesn\'t matter. I didn\'t invent the word ""Slick Willie."" He got that long before I started running against him. I have a confession to make. I did say in the convention ""slippery when wet,"" and I refuse to take it back. Because look, he\'s on one side of an issue and then on the other side of the issue. And as President you simply cannot do that.', 'A lot of people objected to the war. I\'ve no problem with that. I happen to be proud that I did serve my country in uniform and served with honor. What I object to is trying to have all sides of it. He ought to level with the American people on the draft. In April he said, ""I\'m going to come up with all my draft records."" And we haven\'t heard a peep out of any record yet. And even today there was new evidence: an affidavit that when he first ran for office, Governor Clinton\'s friends used special connections to seize his ROTC file and destroy all others. He ought to level on these kinds of things.', ""He'll talk about term limits one place -- may be good; then in the debate says he's against it. He goes to the auto workers and said, oh, he's against the fuel efficiency standards, but then he goes to the environmental group and says he's for them. He says one thing on one place, another thing in another place. And you simply cannot be all things to all people."", 'All during this campaign Governor Clinton has been talking about, ""Let\'s get Government to invest."" I have a different philosophy. I don\'t think the Government invests anything. I think it\'s private business and private individuals that invest.', 'But here are his own words from 4 years ago in Newsweek magazine. Here\'s what Clinton said. He said, ""There\'s lots of evidence you can sell people on tax"" -- exact quote. Let me start. ""There\'s lots of evidence you can sell people on tax increases if they think it\'s an investment."" His own words revealed this duplicity. We\'re talking about investment, and he means tax increase.', 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. Hey, listen, this is Halloween, but you can\'t have a pumpkin with two faces on it. You know what I mean? We simply cannot let the American people fall for this scam. Let me tell you what he said on the Gulf war. It was a tough decision. Let me tell you what he said. When I had to make this very difficult call, a call to which Connecticut\'s sons and daughters responded with great patriotism, great service, and great pride, Governor Clinton put it this way. He said, ""I agree with the arguments the minority made, but I guess I would have voted with the majority."" You talk about a waffle iron. You can\'t have that in the White House. You cannot take a risk for the White House on character, on inexperience. His do not add up and don\'t meet the demands of this high office that I\'m honored to hold.', ""You know, the world is still a dangerous place, and I think we've got to remember that. Who knows where the next crisis is going to come from? You know, I loved this yesterday, the message out of Baghdad. I don't know if they covered it in the Connecticut papers. Saddam Hussein's government is planning a party for 500,000 people in downtown Baghdad predicated on the fact that I'm going to lose. They're wrong. No party. No loss. A big win. A big win. And we are going to keep the pressure on the Bully of Baghdad. We are going to keep the pressure on him until he lives up to every single United Nations resolution; until we can bring peace and relief to his people, the people of Iraq. Stay strong. Do not vacillate."", ""And one other thing, I don't mean to be hypercritical of Governor Clinton, but the other night he started -- at one point -- no, no, I'm not giving him hell. No, no. I don't give him hell. It's like Truman said, you know, you tell the truth, and they think it's hell. That's the difference."", ""You know, the other night in Michigan he told a voter that he's already thought hard about what he's going to do. He said he'll play his saxophone in the White House. He's already planning an inauguration parade. Recently he said he was the underdog, and yesterday he's got his saxophone hanging in the Oval Office. Only Bill Clinton can change his mind that fast."", ""I know that he studied at Oxford. He's a very bright fellow. But maybe he doesn't understand exactly how it works. You see, it's not these pollsters, it's not the pundits, it's not these talking heads on television that tell you how to vote. The American people make up their own mind on election day."", 'I don\'t know why it is there\'s been such a hot-selling item as that bumper sticker that says ""Annoy the Media. Reelect Bush."" There it is. Everyone knows what it means, including the press. But I should caution you, we\'ve granted amnesty to all these that are traveling with us. My ire is not at most of them. It\'s certainly not at the photo dogs and all these guys with the boom mikes. So grant them amnesty and welcome to Connecticut. But I\'ll tell you where it is. I\'ll tell you where it stands. It\'s with these network know-it-alls and these talking heads. They tell you what to think, and we\'re going to prove them wrong. I love a good fight, and we\'re going to take it right to them, right around the media and right to the American people.', ""No, this has been a strange political year. But we're on the move. And I honestly in my heart of hearts tell you, I believe I am going to win this election on November 3d. I have never wavered, and I never will."", 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. I really believe that the American people want a person with experience, certainly don't want one with a pattern of deception, and they want a leader who's been tested. Let me just take you back into history. I'll never forget a cold and rainy day up at Camp David just before I had to make the toughest decision of my life. Kuwait had been invaded, and it stood to the United States to demonstrate to the entire world that aggression would not stand. And yes, Barbara and I went to our little chapel there and prayed that our young men and women would return alive, victorious, and well."", 'And let me say this: This town and all the good people of this State responded in a way that brought this country together unlike anything since the end of World War II. We lifted up the country and with it the veterans of Vietnam and every other occasion, all because we stood firm and did what was right.', ""I learned then the agony of making a really difficult decision, one where you have to send somebody else's son or somebody else's daughter into combat. And it isn't an easy decision. I believe that you have to have the experience. I think you have to have the character. I hope you have to have the strength to be able to make a difficult call like that in the face of all the controversy; in the face of all the press telling you hadn't made your case; in face of all those experts telling us how many body bags would be taken overseas. I made a tough call. I did it not to be popular but because it was right. I know I can do it. I know I can lead this country to 4 more years of prosperity."", 'So your call is: Who best to lead the United States of America into new prosperity? Who best? Who best to say to these young kids, our best days are ahead of us? Who best to accept the trust, the trust of the American people to be in that Oval Office?', ""Thank you for all you've done. Thank you in the inside and the 10,000 people outside. Thank you for what you're doing. Now, go to the polls, elect these people here with me. Do something for your country. Keep America on the move. And don't let them tell you we're a nation in decline. We are the freest, the fairest, the greatest nation on the face of the Earth. Now, let's go and win this election."", 'May God bless you all. May God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you very much.']"
1,George Bush ,"November 02, 1992","['The President. Thank you very much. What a great Louisiana welcome. Unbelievable. Thank you very much. Thank you so very much for this welcome back. And may I at the outset of these remarks say thank you, Louisiana, and thank you, Cheryl Ladd, an old friend, for introducing me here today.', ""And I want to salute Congressman Richard Baker, Congressman Holloway, Congressman Livingston, all three great guys; former Congressman and your former Governor Dave Treen, who's at my side through thick and thin; another great Louisianian, Henson Moore, who is so important to us in the White House and been working his heart out here; and Fox McKeithen and Chuck McMains and Carl Crane and so many others that are helping us in every single way, but especially all of you here tonight to put us over the top in the State of Louisiana."", ""I'll tell you, something is happening across this country. Something is happening across this country. And we are going to annoy the media and reelect George Bush. They don't like it; they don't understand it. Something is happening in our great country. Come Monday, we feel things moving. But come Wednesday, there's going to be no joy in Little Rock, believe me. We're going to win this election. And the pollsters, the pollsters are going to be unemployed, and the rest of the country is going to move forward to jobs and opportunity. [Applause] No, you guys are too much."", ""But here's what it's about. Here's what it is about. There is the choice, is a big difference on experience, on philosophy, and yes, on character. Character matters for President of the United States of America. And yes, the issue is, tomorrow when you go into that booth, the question of trust. Who do you trust with your kids? Who do you trust with your country? Who do you trust to lead the free world?"", ""Governor Clinton says he's the candidate of change. But let's look at what he offers: $150 billion of new taxes to start with -- --"", 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. -- -- $220 billion in new spending. That is trickle-down Government. And we do not need to go back to the failed days when you had a Democrat in the White House and Democrats running, the liberals running the Congress. Governor Clinton\'s numbers don\'t add up. He says, ""Oh, I\'m going to sock it to the rich."" All you guys driving a cab, being a nurse, teaching school, watch out: He\'s coming after you. And we\'re not going to let him do that to the United States of America.', 'And I would remind the entire country from this fired-up rally right here in Baton Rouge -- the one I\'m told is the biggest they\'ve ever had here -- what it was like when we had another guy sounding just like this in the White House, like Governor Clinton. We had interest rates at 21 percent. We had inflation at 15. We had a ""misery index"" of 20. And we are not going to go back to those days.', ""This guy -- change -- he and Ozone Man, all they do is say, change, change, change. That is all you'll have in your pocket if you put these two guys in office, believe me. We're the ones with the positive program. We want to renew, revolutionize education, K through 12, give the parents a choice of schools, religious, private, and public. Put your faith in the parents and in the teachers and in the community, not in some bureaucracy in Washington, DC."", ""We've got the best plan for reforming health care: making insurance available to the poorest of the poor through vouchers; tax credits to that next overworked and overtaxed part; get that insurance pooled so you bring the prices down; and then go after these malpractice lawsuits that are driving the cost of health care right up through the roof."", ""We've got to teach those trial lawyers and Governor Clinton that people want reform of the legal system. It's a shame when people don't dare coach Little League for fear of a crazy lawsuit, don't dare help their fellow man along the highway for afraid of a crazy lawsuit, doctors don't dare deliver babies for fear of a crazy lawsuit. It is time to stand up to the trial lawyers and put some liability limits on this insurance."", ""And there's another big difference. The other day in southern Louisiana, I signed a brandnew national energy strategy that changes this alternative minimum tax and says, look, we are going to get the oilfields back to work by giving them a tax break."", 'And we\'ve got a very good record in the environment. But it is Ozone Man -- and this is why I call him that -- who has said in Santa Barbara, California, ""No more offshore drilling anywhere."" That is wrong. That is wrong for this country.', 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. But typical, one day he makes that statement in California, ""No more anywhere""; then he comes here and hedges and said he didn\'t say it. Then they played the tape to him right in Louisiana where he said, ""No more drilling anywhere."" And now he said, ""Well, yes, I said it, but."" You cannot have a lot of ""buts"" in the Oval Office. And Governor Clinton keeps going, one side of the issue one day, one side the next.', ""No, you can't have it all ways. You can't be all things to all people in this job. You call them as you see them. If you make a mistake, you look the American people in the eye, like any family person would, and say, I was wrong. And then you go forward and lead the country. You don't try to waffle. You don't try to be on all sides of every question."", 'And believe me, Governor Clinton wants to expand the American Government. And I want to expand the American dream for every kid here today.', 'Now let\'s talk about character and trust. I happen to believe that they\'re both important. I happen to believe they are both important, because people look to the United States and to the President for just that kind of leadership. And Governor Clinton said in the debate, he said it\'s not a question of the character of the President, it is ""the character of the Presidency."" Wrong. They\'re interlocked. You can\'t separate them out for the time that the man is President.', 'I mentioned Horace Greeley\'s words in the last debate we had. But here\'s the full quote. He said, ""Fame is a vapor, popularity an accident, riches take wing; only character endures."" And that\'s true, whether it\'s in a family, whether it\'s in a business deal, or whether it\'s as President of the United States of America.', ""And so, my pitch at the end is that we simply cannot take a risk on Governor Clinton. Neither his experience nor his character, given this position on one side or the other, is what's right for this country at this time."", ""We are the greatest nation. You know, Governor Clinton and Ozone go around telling everybody that we are a nation in decline, that we're less than Germany, that we are more than Sri Lanka. Wrong. We are the most respected nation on the face of the Earth. And we have made dramatic strides towards world peace. They don't ever like to talk about foreign affairs. But let me tell you something on the eve of going to the polls. I am very proud to have been the President that has greatly reduced, if not eliminated, the threat of nuclear war from the face of the Earth."", 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', 'The President. You know, let me tell you something -- --', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. I honestly believe we're going to get 4 more years tomorrow."", ""You know, I have another big difference with Governor Clinton. It relates to war and peace. I am very proud that I wore the uniform of this country and fought for my country in combat. And the media elite don't like it, but I still think it is wrong, when your country is fighting, to go to organize demonstrations in a foreign land against the United States of America."", 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. And thank God we didn't waffle when Saddam Hussein took over Kuwait. Thank God we stood up and said this aggression will not stand. And thanks to the sons and daughters of Louisiana and others across this country, it did not stand."", ""And yesterday, a couple of days ago, there's this marvelous dispatch out of Baghdad a couple of days ago, Saddam Hussein's government announcing that they plan a party in downtown Baghdad of 500,000 people if I lose. Well, let me tell Saddam something here tonight: He can put his party on hold. And he'd better live up to all those resolutions of the United Nations and take the pressure off his people. Now, Saddam won't be happy, but I'll be happy that he's not happy. Look at it that way."", 'Now, let me ask you this. Imagine a year from today picking up a newspaper in your house and seeing that somewhere in the world or somewhere right at home there is a significant domestic crisis, an unforeseen crisis. Imagine that in this dangerous situation an American leader, totally without experience, completely untested, a leader about really whom we know very little still, and what we do know is his troubling pattern of being on one side and then another and bringing this ingrained habit of trying to lead people by misleading them. And when that next crisis comes, and you know darn well it will, the entire world is going to be looking to the American President. Make no mistake about that. And they will look to his experience, and they will count on his character.', 'And I have been tested by fire. We have managed world change. It gets of almost Biblical proportions. And our success can be measured by the headlines that were never written, the countless crises that have never taken place, because we stayed firm and strong and never waffled.', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', 'Audience members. George Bush! George Bush! George Bush!', 'The President. The decision that we made on Desert Storm was made not because it was popular. Think back to the demonstrations, to the reluctance of Congress, to the testimony before the Congress, counting millions of body bags that might return. It was not an easy call, and clearly it was not a popular call. But as President you have to make a call when you believe it was right, and that was the right thing to do.', ""And I will never forget that cold day up there in Camp David at our little chapel when Barbara and I literally prayed for the safety of the young men and women that were about to go to war. And let's never forget, we are one Nation under God, and in the Oval Office or in your families, we should never forget that. And we prayed those kids would come back. And back they came, with their heads high. And they lifted our country up and brought it together and erased the agony of Vietnam and made everybody proud, proud again to be Americans."", 'And so yes, I do believe in honor, duty, and country. And I ask for you to remember that another crisis may occur, and we better have a Commander in Chief that shares those Louisiana values.', ""Let me conclude now. We're getting near the end of the trail. This is the second-to-last campaign appearance that I'll ever make on my own behalf after half my adult life in public life -- half in the private life right here, much of it in Louisiana; half of it in business, the other half in public life. And this is the end of the road in terms of the campaigning."", ""And so let me ask you in all seriousness to think seriously about this and ask that you not take lightly your responsibility that you'll have tomorrow. You see, democracy was conceived from liberty, nurtured by freedom, and protected by the blood of those who came before us. And when you walk alone into that booth tomorrow, you'll not spend more than a couple of minutes. But your single voice will echo down the corridor of time. And with your vote, you will help shape the entire future of this, the most blessed, special nation that man has ever known and that God has ever created. And what we do together, what we do together tomorrow will cast its shadow forward into eternity."", ""And so your vote is an act of power, a statement of principle, and a messenger of possibility. And so like all the candidates, I ask only that you think deeply about our Nation, about those that need help, about our needs, because tomorrow the polls don't matter. The pundits don't count. On election day, it is the American people who speak their mind. And only conscience should be your guide."", ""And don't let anyone tell you we're a nation in decline. We've come out of some very hard times. We're beginning to move. And I ask for your support for 4 more years to help every young person in this room enjoy the American dream."", 'May God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you and God bless you all. Thank you.']"
2,George Bush ,"November 02, 1992","['The President. What an awesome array -- --', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', 'The President. What an awesome array. What a great homecoming and a great welcome back.', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', 'The President. Thank you very, very much. Thank you, thank you. Thank you so very much. Thank all of you. And may I start by thanking this awesome array of wonderful people, Bob Hope and all the rest of them, for being with us tonight. Thank all of you from the bottom of our grateful hearts.', ""Texas, that's where it all started for Barbara and me: 44 years ago when we moved out to Texas, west Texas, we voted in our first Presidential election out there; here in Houston, 30 years ago, when I gave my very first speech on my own behalf. And tonight, in Texas, I will give my last speech ever on my own behalf as a candidate for reelection as President of the United States."", 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', 'The President. You know, when we drove that car out to Odessa 44 years ago, we were tired and we were worn out. Our spirits were high. We knew we had big things in front of us. And tonight we come home from another long, long journey a little tired, a little worn, but fired up because we are going to win this election tomorrow.', 'We are on the verge of something big. We are on the verge of something very, very big, something historic in American politics: the biggest comeback in American political history. And this guarantees it. I\'m not much for predictions. No, I just tell the truth, and they think it\'s hell. You remember Harry Truman? I\'m not very much for predictions, but come Wednesday morning, there\'s going to be a whole lot of pollsters looking around for something else to do. And America\'s going to be moving forward. America will be moving forward again, united, strong, ready to move this country into the end of this century with a lot of power. And the bottom line is this: Yes, we will ""Annoy the Media and Reelect Bush.""', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. We came to Texas, as I said, 44 years ago to begin our lives. I got the book-learning back East, but I learned about life right here in Texas, first at Corpus Christi where I got my Navy wings -- and yes, I am proud that I served my country in war -- and then out west in the Permian Basin and later right here in the Gulf Coast. We come here tonight to begin again, begin the process of American renewal, because we know that we have changed the world. Now let's get together and help change America and lift everybody up."", ""And so the pundits say our campaign is against the odds. So what. I have a feeling the gods are smiling on us, and I know we're going to win this campaign. And here is why: My confidence stems from a simple fact that even in this time of uncertainty and transition, the American people share our values. And that's one of the reasons we'll do it, some simple, commonsense beliefs that Barbara and I learned right here in the great State of Texas. I learned that the strength of our Nation does not end up on the marble mausoleums along the Potomac but in the souls and the hearts of the hard-working people in places like Tyler and Waco and Corpus and Houston."", 'And while Governor Clinton dreams, while he dreams -- --', 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. -- -- while he dreams of expanding the American Government, I know what really matters: I want to expand the American dream.', ""And in Texas, I learned that family and faith and certainly friends are all there really is, and that America always will be indivisible, undivided, one Nation under God. It was here in west Texas in the oilfield I learned that a person's word is worth a million dollars, just the word of honor, and that if you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything. And it was there that I learned that great nations, like great men, must keep their word of honor. And I have done that as President of the United States. Great men, like great nations, must also do that."", ""And I learned about character. Character is what you are when no one's looking and what you say when no one is listening. And I learned that character really is the father of leadership -- not money, not fame, not intelligence. It is character. And here in Texas, or in the Oval Office, character counts."", ""And most of all, right here in Texas at Sunday dinners or at those Friday night football games, I was reminded every single day that there is no place like this great Nation. We are a special land with a special spirit. There is no place like America. And don't let Clinton and Gore tell you we're a nation in decline. We're a rising nation. We can solve any problem. And I want to lead this country to new heights for 4 more years."", 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', 'The President. And so I offer in this campaign a proven record of leadership, leadership that has literally revolutionized the world. Leadership that has been tested by fire. Leadership that has made our children dream the sweet dreams of peace instead of the nightmare of nuclear war.', 'And I offer trust, not in Government but in you, the American people. And I offer a deep and abiding faith in the future of our great Nation. Clinton and Gore say we are in decline, something less than Germany but a little more than Sri Lanka. They are wrong. We are the United States of America, the greatest, freest nation on the face of the Earth.', ""And I learned a lot about life. I learned a lot about life right here. I learned that you fight when your back is up against the wall. You never give up when you're behind. You push on and you fight for what you believe in. And you will win."", ""There is no way that Barbara and I can ever adequately say thank you -- not possible -- thank you to the people in this room, thank you to the people of Texas, thank you to our friends here. I will single out one person who is at my side once again in the battle of my life, and that is Jim Baker of Houston, Texas, our great Secretary of State. And I remind you that time and again our political journeys, we've defeated the odds. And time and again we've proved the naysayers wrong. I think America likes a comeback. I think they like somebody that fights for what he believes in. And that's what I am doing, right here, right down to the wire."", 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', 'The President. Did you see the dispatch out of Baghdad a couple of days ago? Saddam Hussein is said to be planning a party in the streets of Baghdad for 500,000 Iraqis if we lose. But tonight I have a message for my friend Saddam Hussein: Cancel. Cancel the celebration. Cancel the celebration. We are going to win, and we are going to make you adhere to every single resolution passed by the United Nations.', ""You know, I will readily contend that I've never been too hot with words, and I think you know that. In fact, some of the more elite pundits say I can't finish a sentence. Well, they may be right from time to time. But I'll tell you something, though. I think you also know, I think especially the people here do, that I care very deeply about our Nation. And I believe that we must treat this precious treasure with great care. America is something that has been passed on to us. And we must shape it. We must improve it. We must help people and be kind to people. And then we must pass that on to our kids and to our grandkids."", ""And tomorrow you participate in a ritual, a sacred ritual of stewardship, a ritual that was conceived by liberty and nurtured by freedom and defended by the blood of those who came before. And when you walk alone into the voting booth, you will not spend more than a couple of minutes, but your voice will echo down the corridors of history. And with your vote, you are going to help shape the future of this, the most blessed, special nation that man has ever known and God has helped create. And so, look at your vote -- especially the young people -- look at your vote as an act of power, a statement of principle. And tonight I ask only that you think deeply about our Nation and about its needs, because tomorrow the polls don't matter. The pundits don't count. On election day, only conscience should be your guide."", ""And when America votes their conscience, we will unleash a great power, a power stronger than any tank, faster than any airplane. This power will sweep past the cynics and the pundits and the pollster, and it will sweep us into office. And it will lift America up. It will lift us up to new heights for all. Don't listen to those critics and those pessimists who can only win by telling you how bad things are. We can solve the problems. But we are the greatest, fairest, freest nation on the face of the Earth. And I ask for your trust and your support to lead our great country for 4 more years."", ""Thank you -- a most magnificent welcome home. And may God bless you all.

3,George Bush ,"November 02, 1992","['The President. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Here we go for the last day. Thank you all. Thank you so very much. Thank you. May I start by thanking Rush Limbaugh. And last night, Governor Clinton was at the Meadowlands with Richard Gere and other Hollywood liberals.', 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. Well, here's a good deal for you. Let Governor Clinton have Richard Gere. I'll take Rush Limbaugh any day."", ""May I salute Governor Tom Kean. There's a great nostalgia in this State wishing they had Tom Kean back because they don't like the tax-and-spend policies of Governor Florio. My friend, Dean Gallo, great Congressman; and Mayor Capen and Jinny Littel; and the Madison High School and Chatam High School bands. It's just great to have them here today."", 'You know, you see some strange reports. Yesterday or the day before they had Governor Clinton talking about his inaugural parade. My advice is, put the parade on hold, Governor, because I am going to win this election tomorrow.', ""The pundits don't matter. These national pollsters who have been all over the field, they don't matter. What Governor Clinton doesn't understand, it is the people in that booth tomorrow that matter. They don't want somebody who is going to expand the American Government. They want somebody like me who is going to expand the American dream and make life better for every young person here today."", ""You know, the choice tomorrow is based on these points: a vast difference in experience, a vast difference in philosophy, and yes, Rush is right, a vast difference in character. That matters. Don't let them tell you it doesn't matter. I guess it boils down to this when you go into the booth all across this country: Who do you trust? If there's a crisis out there, who do you trust with your family? Who do you trust with the future of this country?"", 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. Thank you very much. I had planned to ruin part of this rally by talking about the Arkansas record. I won't do it to you. I won't do it to you. But I will say this: I remember coming to -- --"", ""Audience member. Give 'em hell, George!"", ""The President. I don't give them hell, I just tell them the truth, and they think it's hell. You know, it's like Truman said. But let me point this out: Governor Clinton has the 50th record, 50 out of 50, at the bottom, in environmental initiatives. I came to this State 4 years ago and said we're going to clean up those beaches, we're going to stop ocean dumping; we're going to get a Clean Air Act. We've got a good record on the environment, and Governor Clinton has the 50th in the entire country down there in Arkansas."", ""As we approach the environment, we ought not to go to the extreme, like Ozone Man does. He'd throw everyone -- he's backtracking so fast he looks like the guy on the unicycle we just saw, going backwards. We've got to have a little more concern about the working man and the working woman in this country and still be good for the environment. And that's what we've been."", 'You know, 48th in the percentage of adults with high school diplomas, 48th in spending on corrections, 46th on teachers\' salaries, 45th on the overall well-being of children. Then Governor Clinton gets up and says, ""I will do for America what I\'ve done for Arkansas."" No way, Bill! No way!', ""The bad news for Governor Clinton is that there's good news for this country. We've got a long way to go. We've got to help people. But when the economy is showed to be not in a recession, as he's been telling the country, but growing at 2.7 percent, that came as bad news, because the only way they can win is to convince the people of America that we are in decline and that the economy is awful. Yes, it needs to improve, but the worst thing we could do is put a tax-and-spend liberal back into that White House."", 'You know, in this campaign Governor Clinton said, ""Well, I\'m a different kind of a Democrat, especially on the economy."" He says he doesn\'t favor middle class taxes, he wants investment. He\'s talking about Government investing. Now, remember that, and listen to this. Here\'s what he said in Newsweek magazine: Bill Clinton says, and this is an exact quote, ""There\'s a lot of evidence you can sell people on tax increases if they think it\'s an investment."" Those were his own words, his own duplicity. When he says ""investment,"" America, watch your wallet. He\'s talking about taxes.', 'Now, you got plenty of that message right here in New Jersey, deja vu all over again with Jim Florio, higher taxes, more spending, economic stagnation. We\'re going to change all that. When Bill Clinton\'s blowing that ""taxophone"" -- [laughter] -- middle class America will be singing the blues. We just can\'t let that happen to the United States.', 'Governor Clinton says he\'s the candidate of change. What he means by that is he wants -- and this is his numbers -- ""I want to tax $150 billion more. I want $220 billion more in new spending."" You talk about trickle-down, that is trickle-down Government, take it from you and let Government spending. We cannot do that.', 'And I would remind America what it was like the last time we had a man coming in with exactly the same approach. When Jimmy Carter left office, or just before, we had inflation at 15 percent. We had interest rates at 21 percent, 21 percent. We had the ""misery index"" at 20. America was then in decline until Ronald Reagan and I came along and straightened it out and gave hope for this country.', 'The way we\'re going to do that -- New Jersey is a great export State. We are going to create more American jobs by selling the best product in the world, ""Made in America"" products, overseas. We\'re going to open these foreign markets. And it is small business that creates the jobs. Instead of putting the money in Government, how about a little tax relief for the people along Main Street? How about less taxes, less regulation, less lawsuits?', ""We need legal reform. We are suing each other too much in this country and caring for each other too little. And the trial lawyers won't let the slippery one do anything about it at all. They won't let him do anything about it at all. The head trial lawyer in Arkansas said he's never been for reform. And we are going to reform it so doctors can practice medicine, Little League coaches can coach, good Samaritans along the highway can help their fellow man without fear of a crazy lawsuit."", ""Health care: We've got the best plan. Make insurance available to all, but do not let the Government screw around with the quality of health care in this country."", ""In education we've got the new approach: reform. More than that, it is actually revolutionizing education. Bypass the powerful NEA, and let the teachers and the parents and the communities have more say in education without mandates from the Federal Government. And beside that, one way to make all schools better is for parents to have the choice of whatever school they want, private, public, or religious. Given them competition and give those parents a needed break."", ""Crime: Let me be clear where I stand on that one. I support the men and women who are out there in our neighborhoods every single day, trying to fight against the criminal elements. I'm talking about the police, the local police, the State police, whoever it is. I support the police officers and not the criminals. You know, we need more -- I think of Dean Gallo here and what he's doing for the victims of crime. He's been a leader in Congress for that. And I believe we need more sympathy for the victims of crime and a little less, a little less for the criminals themselves."", ""They talk about getting the deficit down. With the new Congress -- and there's going to be over 100, maybe 150. And you know why they're going there? Because the leadership that's controlled the Congress for 38 years has messed it up so bad they can't even run a two-bit bank, say nothing about a tiny little post office. They're going to clean House. And with them will come a lot of new Members of Congress. And when that happens, how about protecting the taxpayers with this: a balanced budget amendment; a taxpayer check-off so the taxpayer gets to allocate 10 percent of his taxes to making the Congress bring that deficit down; a line-item veto so the President can do -- [applause]. And I like that concept of giving the Congress back to the people and having term limits so these people don't become entrenched over the years."", 'And now let\'s talk a little about character, because I really believe that the Presidency is shaped by the -- you know, Governor Clinton said it\'s not the character of the President, it is ""the character of the Presidency."" Wrong, Bill, wrong. They are interlocked. You have to have the trust of the people through character, and you have to have the trust of the world when you are President of the United States.', 'You know, I quoted Horace Greeley in one of the debates. And here\'s what he said. He said, ""Fame"" -- and think about this now -- ""Fame is a vapor, popularity an accident, riches take wing; only character endures."" That is so true. And I think it is especially true of the Presidency. It matters not just because of the plans you make but the crises that you never foresee.', 'And we simply cannot take a risk on Governor Clinton. He is wrong for America on the issues, and I believe I am better for America on character. He goes after me with a vengeance. And let me tell you something, I\'m not the guy who invented the word ""slick."" I did say ""slippery when wet,"" and I\'ll stand with that. But I did not say ""slick."" That came from the primary. That came from his own hometown newspapers. So I am going to say, let them speak for them; I\'ll speak for me. I am a better, I will be a better President for the young people in this country for 4 more years than Governor Clinton ever would. Here\'s why. Here\'s why.', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. Here is why. You know, as President you cannot be on all sides of every issue. You've got to look people in the eye, call them as you see them, like the umpire. If you make a mistake, say so, and then go on about leading the American people. But Governor Clinton, one day he's for the NAFTA agreement; the next day he's against it. One day he's for term limits, oh yes; in the debate he opposes it. One day he's going to go for these taxes, and then the next day he backs away. One day he's for fuel efficiency standards that would throw a lot of auto workers out of work; the next day he backs away, and he's going to study that one."", 'Here\'s what he said, his own words, on the Persian Gulf: ""I agree with the arguments the minority made, but I guess I would have voted with the majority."" What kind of Commander in Chief would that be?', 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. And in spite of the harassing from the media -- listen, I\'ve got to define the ground rules on the media. I love these signs, ""Annoy the Media. Reelect Bush."" And every one of you know what that means. Every one of you know that there has not been objectivity in the coverage. Every one of you know it. And they are having their own debates, all these talking heads: ""Have we been fair? Well, this is the way we do it. That\'s the way we do it."" And everyone knows that they\'re covering up the fact this has been the most biased year in the history of Presidential politics. But we don\'t need them anymore. We don\'t need them. I take out as much ire on these Republican talking heads on the talk shows on Sunday as I do on the Democrats. They\'re all running for cover. And we are going to show them wrong.', ""I'll tell you who else we're going to show wrong. It was Saddam Hussein's government. A couple of days ago they said they were going to have a celebration, 500,000 people in downtown Baghdad, thinking I was going to lose. And then yesterday they kind of backed away from -- well, I've got a message for Saddam Hussein: You're going to have to contend with me. You're going to have to do what the United Nations said. We're going to keep the pressure on you until you take the pressure off your own people."", ""So here it is. Here is what is going to determine this election. Yes, it is trust, and yes, it is character. Because, look, we've come a long way. These kids in these bands go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war as their mothers and dad had. That is dramatic change. It is worldwide change, and we helped bring it about."", ""But here's the problem. We still have problems out there threatening this country. Who knows where the next crisis will appear? And imagine a dangerous situation; an American leader totally without experience, completely untested; a person who couldn't even call it right when aggression threatened the whole world. And what we see is a troubling pattern of deception, an ingrained habit of trying to lead people by misleading them. And when that crisis occurs, and you can bet it will, the entire world looks to the President of the United States of America, looks to his experience, looks to his determination. And they will. They will count on his character."", ""I have been tested. We've managed the world change of almost Biblical proportions. And our success can be measured by the headlines that were never written, the countless crises that never occurred. Let's keep a President in that Oval Office who is strong and knows to stand up for America."", 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. And let me give you another reason to reelect me. I've tried very hard to stand for true family values there, respecting all different kinds and sizes of family, but standing for values like safety in the neighborhoods and teachers, supporting them, and discipline in the family, respect for this flag of ours, whatever it may be. I've tried to stand for that all along."", ""And tomorrow you're going to have a major decision to make on who do you trust to stay in that Oval Office. Let me tell you something. I think we've got one good reason, because every time Barbara Bush holds a little child in her arms, an AIDS baby, or reads to them, she is demonstrating compassion. And believe me, we have the best First Lady we possibly could have."", 'Audience members. Barbara! Barbara! Barbara!', ""The President. I know it's unfashionable to talk about faith, but I remember that cold day up in Camp David when we had to make this terrible decision about sending the sons and daughters of New Jersey into Desert Storm, into combat. And my experience in combat, the pride I felt in wearing the uniform of this country made a difference in how I made that decision. On that cold day in Camp David, Barbara and I went to that little chapel, and yes, we prayed that I would do the right thing and that these young men and women would come home safe. And they did. They lifted up the morale of this country. They lifted the burden off the veterans of Vietnam. They raised with pride service to country. And I'll tell you something: It was a proud moment. And the press and the media are not going to distort it. It was decent and noble and made us the leader of the entire world."", ""So now we go. The last day I will ever campaign for myself for President of the United States or anything else, and I can't tell you what this crowd means. So just take this enthusiasm and go to the polls, take your neighbor, get that Local 172 mobilized. You talk about good, decent, hard-working Americans. Fantastic. Get them to the polls. Vote for trust and character and lifting up this country."", ""And don't let Governor Clinton win based on the country in decline. Look, we are the United States of America. We are the envy of the world. We are one Nation under God, the world leader. Don't let them forget it. Vote for George Bush."", 'Thank you all very much. May God bless our great country.

I want to salute Congressmen Curt Weldon and Larry Coughlin, Bob Walker, with us. You know, you see a lot of signs saying ""Clean House!"" People are tired of the Congress the way it is. So send Larry Hollin and send Craig Snyder to Washington. May I send a special vote of thanks to the Oak Ridge Boys and urge that we send Arlen Specter back to the United States Senate. And let me thank so many people who are working hard to guarantee a Republican victory throughout Pennsylvania.', ""You know, Governor Clinton has gotten a little premature. He's talking about his inaugural parade. My advice to him is: Put the parade on hold, Bill; you're not going to win this election."", 'Tomorrow, you see, it\'s not the pollsters, and it\'s not the national press, it is the people that decide these elections. That\'s what we\'re going to show them tomorrow. The reason we\'re going to win is this: Because the choice the American people have is about a difference in experience, a difference in philosophy, and yes, a difference in character. Character matters. Parents are going to say, ""Who do I trust our kids with?"" And I believe the answer is George Bush.', 'You know, Governor Clinton made a scary statement in one of the debates. He said, ""I want to do for this country what I\'ve done for Arkansas."" No way! We can\'t let that happen. They are near the bottom in education, on the environment, on the economy. We cannot let that happen to the United States of America.', ""You've heard all this time about how things are not going. We are improving. The economy moved at 2.7. And the last thing we need is to go back to tax and spend the way the Democrats want to do it."", 'Bill Clinton offers an economic disaster for this country. You know, in this campaign he said, ""I am a different kind of Democrat, especially on the economy."" He says he doesn\'t want middle class tax cuts, he wants investment. But the American people, before they go to the polls, as you hear Governor Clinton talk about investment, ought to listen to this. Here\'s what he said in Newsweek magazine: ""There is a lot of evidence that you can sell people on tax increases if they think it\'s an investment."" Those were his words, and that means he is out to tax the American people. Let\'s not let him do that.', 'Governor Clinton says he is a candidate of change. You remember that last time we had a Democrat in the White House and this Congress controlled by the Democrats. You had interest rates at 21 percent. We had inflation at 15 percent. You had the ""misery index"" at 20. And we simply cannot go back to those days. Let\'s move this forward with less taxes and less spending.', ""The way to do that is to stimulate small business. Give them a tax break for investment taxes. Give them a tax break for that first-time homebuyer to let that homebuyer live in the American dream. Let's do something about these crazy lawsuits that are killing this country."", ""We've got the best agenda for education.

You know, Horace Greeley said, ""Fame is a vapor, popularity an accident, riches take wing; only character endures."" I think that is especially true as the President of the United States of America. If you make a mistake, tell the truth about it. But you cannot be on all sides of every issue. You can\'t do that. You cannot lie to the American people.', 'Here\'s a man, Governor Clinton, whose own hometown newspaper says he\'s a politician utterly without principle, a guy whose supporters gave him that name ""Slick."" We didn\'t invent that. It came out of the Democratic primary, out of Arkansas. I say ""slippery when wet,"" a little different but the same thing.', ""But the pattern of deception is what is troubling the American people. They see it on term limits. They see it on North American free trade agreement. They see it on taxes. They see it on these environmental standards. I think we ought to think about the working man and the working woman and have good environment without going to the extreme like the Ozone Man wants. We've got it. Somebody better think of the families that are working for a living, and we're doing both, a good sound environmental record but not the extreme that's going to throw more Americans out of work."", 'But you know, being on all sides of the issue, listen to this one about the Gulf war. Here\'s what he said, when Bob Walker and these other Congressmen here, Curt Weldon and Larry, were standing up and doing what\'s right, here\'s what Governor Clinton said. He said, ""I agree with the arguments the minority made, but I guess I would have voted with the majority."" What kind of leadership is that for the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces?', ""You know there was a statement out of Baghdad the other day, said that Saddam Hussein was planning a big rally when Governor Clinton won. Well, Saddam ought to put it on hold. And today he backed away. He's probably listening to the national media, who see us moving now. And here's my point: Saddam Hussein is not going to rejoice, because we're going to win the election and we're going to make him live up to those international resolutions and help the people over there."", ""So what it boils down to is this, it boils down to character and trust. I ask you to just imagine reading about an upheaval now. We brought peace to the world and way and tremendous quantities. These young people here, even these characters, they go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war. That's something big. That is something important for the world, for mankind."", ""But the world is not without threat. Imagine in a dangerous situation -- the question is if a crisis arises, at home or abroad, who do you want to solve the crisis? Who do you want to do it? You cannot do it with a leader that has a pattern of deception. You cannot do it with a leader who went to a foreign country and demonstrated against his own country when his people were at war. Look, a lot of people disagreed on the war, but not many of them went to a foreign land and organized a demonstration when kids were being drafted out of the ghetto and Americans were held prisoner in Hanoi. I don't like that.

I read in the paper that Governor Clinton was already planning his inaugural parade.', 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. No problem. Put the parade on hold, Bill. Put it on hold, because it's not the pundits that matter; it's not the media back in Washington, DC, that matters. On Tuesday it is the voter, the American people that matter."", ""Here's why we're going to win it: Because the choice before the American people is a choice of real differences, difference in experience, difference in philosophy, and yes, difference in character. Character is important. The American people are going to have to decide, and they will. The issue tomorrow is also trust, and they're going to have to decide: Who do you trust with your children? Who do you trust with the United States of America?"", ""We have literally, through our leadership, helped dramatically change the world, bring peace to the world. The young people here today go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war that their parents had. That is dramatic change. Now America's economy is recovering. We are going to bring that same leadership, with a brandnew Congress, to help every single family here in the United States of America."", 'You know, one reason that I believe I\'m going to win is that things are getting in focus on what\'s happened in Arkansas. The press hasn\'t wanted to talk about it, but I do, because I think it is only fair that the American people know what Governor Clinton\'s record is. They are near the bottom on education, 45th for teachers\' salaries; 50th for environment; terrible on the economy. He\'s had one good year, and that\'s the year he was out of town most of the time. And the good people of Arkansas deserve better. But here\'s what worries me. Governor Clinton in the debate said, ""I want to do for America what I\'ve done for Arkansas."" No way!', 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. No, Arkansas changed its slogan from ""Land of Opportunity"" to ""Natural State."" I want America to be the land of opportunity, and it is. It is.', ""The worst news for Governor Clinton and the worst news for the liberals that control the United States Congress is they've been telling us all along that we've been in a recession. We have grown for six straight quarters, and this quarter grew at 2.7 percent. They're telling us that we're worse than Japan, Germany, and Europe. We are better than they are, and we're going to make it better still and move this country ahead. Yes, people are hurting. Yes, people are hurting, but now with things beginning to move, let's not go back and take us back to the tax-and-spend days that brought us real ruin."", ""Governor Clinton -- you know, you've been reading he talks about investment, we need more money so we have Government invest. Let me tell you something. Government never made a sound investment in human beings in their life, or in jobs. It's the small business that makes investment. Let's help small business: less taxes, less regulation."", 'Just so we tell it straight before people go to the polls, talking about investment, here\'s what Governor Clinton said in 1988 in Newsweek. He said, ""There\'s a lot of evidence you can sell people on tax increases if they think it\'s an investment."" That was what he said 4 years ago. Now we hear that cry, ""investment."" What he means is, America, watch your wallets. He\'s coming after you in taxes.', ""We are not going to let the middle class pay for that scam. It is a scam. Change, change, change, change, says Clinton and the Ozone Man. Change, change, change, change, change. That's all you're going to have left if he gets in there with more taxes and more Government spending."", 'You know why I call him Ozone Man? Let me tell you something, our administration has taken the lead on CFC\'s internationally, the thing that causes concern for the ozone. We brought you the Clean Air Act. We\'ve done better on forests. We\'ve cleaned up the oceans and the beaches. But we are not going to go to the extremes like Gore and Clinton when they say, ""We want Federal fuel efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles per gallon."" You\'ve got some great auto workers in this State. I am going to keep them at work, not throw them out of work.', 'Change, change, Governor Clinton got in a huddle with the handlers, and they said keep talking about change. Let me remind you of what it was like when we had a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress. We had change. We had interest rates at 21 percent. We had inflation at 15. We had a ""misery index"" at 20 percent. We don\'t need that kind of change for America.', ""What we need instead is a positive agenda. We've got one for rebuilding our schools, for reforming health care, for creating jobs through less spending, less taxation, and more tax breaks for these businesses."", 'Governor Clinton -- I can just feel it, these liberals, they want to expand Government, and I want to expand the American dream.', ""Now let's talk trust, and let's talk character, because they do matter. I love it when that national talking-head media take me on. I love it, because I like a good fight. There's no reason my holding back anymore."", 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', 'The President. Hey, wait a minute, before I go any further, we grant amnesty. I want this clearly understood. Grant amnesty to these guys over here. Aim your feelings -- and I know you have them because every time somebody holds up one of those bumper stickers, it says, ""Annoy the Media. Re-elect Bush,"" and everybody in this country knows what it means. You know what it means. Everybody knows what it means.', ""So don't let them tell you that family values don't matter. They do. We want to strengthen the American family by backing up our law enforcement people. Do what Barbara Bush does, reading to those children, get the parents to do that. We have a great First Lady, incidentally."", ""Give them school choice so the parent can choose private, public, or religious schools. We've already brought choice in child care. Strengthen the American family. Strengthen the American family."", '[At this point, there was an interruption in the audience.]', ""I think we need a doctor over here. We'll get it. Somebody will be coming. And now let's finish. And let's be sure we get attention. They've got somebody -- all right? Okay. We'll get -- is she okay? Now, here we go. We've had a little accident over here."", 'But let me just say this: It is character and it is trust that is going to determine this election. There\'s no question about it. Listen to the words of Horace Greeley. You young people particularly, remember this. Here\'s what he said. He said, ""Fame is a vapor, popularity an accident, riches take wing; only character endures."" And this is true. This is very true.', 'Governor Clinton said in the debate, he said it\'s not the character of the President, it is ""the character of the Presidency."" Wrong, they\'re interlocked. The President is forming the character of the Presidency. And that is important.', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', 'The President. We cannot have a pattern of deception. It\'s like any family. A President makes a mistake, he says, ""Look, I made a mistake. Now let me help continue to lead this country."" You cannot be on all sides of all issues if you\'re President of the United States.', 'I\'ll give you one example. Let me give you one example. When I had to make the toughest decision of my life, whether to send somebody else\'s son, somebody else\'s daughter into combat on Desert Storm, I made a decision not because it was popular. We had plenty of people in the media, plenty of people demonstrating, plenty of Congressmen telling me it was wrong. But I made the right decision. And what did Governor Clinton say? He said, ""I agree with the arguments of the minority, but I guess I would have voted with the majority."" What kind of Commander in Chief will waffle like that?', 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. As a result, we crushed aggression. We lifted the spirits of America. We honored the Vietnam veterans as well as the veterans of Desert Storm.', ""There was a very interesting announcement out of Baghdad, of all places, the other day, that Saddam Hussein's government is planning a party -- they said 500,000 people -- if Governor Clinton wins. Well, Saddam, put it on hold, old fellow, because we are going to make you live up to every resolution passed by the United Nations. We're going to make you lighten up on the people of Iraq."", ""I ask this at the end. We've helped the world become more peaceful by busting up international communism. But let me tell you this: The world is still a dangerous place. I don't want to cut into the muscle of our defense. I feel a responsibility to young people to keep this country strong. We've reduced defense, but we can't do what Clinton and Gore want, cut right into the muscle of the defense. I'm not going to do that. The reason we're not is because it still is a dangerous place, this world of ours. It's still a dangerous place. I believe that we need a Commander in Chief that the people trust, who has had the experience and hopefully has demonstrated the character to lead this country in peace and to lead it in war."", 'And so tomorrow -- --', 'Audience members.

Four more years!', ""The President. Thank you very much. Let me just start by thanking first all of you for this great Kentucky welcome and a great Kentucky sendoff into the final hours of the campaign. Tomorrow, let's do the country a favor and give the country back to the people by sending some new Representatives to the United States Congress. Let's send Dave Williams to the Senate. And you know, you hear a lot about the able women candidates, strong, powerful women. We have one right here in Susan Stokes. I want to see her win. Get her in there. Get her up there. You talk about cleaning House, we can start right here, I'll tell you. May I thank Mitch McConnell, who has been at my side through thick and thin. We climbed off the plane, and he said, we are going to win Kentucky. What a great Senator you have."", ""You know, the last couple of days, I don't know whether you saw it here, but Governor Clinton's been talking about his inaugural parade and playing sax -- wait a -- --"", 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. -- -- playing his saxophone in the White House. Well, I told him, hold on, Bill, not so fast. Don't believe the pollsters; believe the American people. We are going to win the election."", ""No, that's the way it works. You go to the polls, and the people make these decisions. They don't have to have a filter. They don't have to have one of those instant analysts coming across, those people that tell us from Washington every Sunday what's wrong with our country. Let's go and vote for what's right, the reelection of George Bush and more prosperity for this country."", ""Hey, listen, if we'd do it the way the media wants you, they wouldn't even have -- if they were running the races here, they'd just say who the favorite is and let it go. That's not the way it works at Churchill Downs, and that ain't the way it works for American politics, either."", ""Here's what it's about. The choice before the American people is the vast difference in experience, a vast difference in philosophy, and yes, a vast difference in character. Character matters. The big question the American people ask tomorrow is: Who do we trust? Who do we trust with our kids? Who do we trust with our country?"", ""Governor Clinton talks about change, change, change. That's all we hear about -- uses the word about 50 times every minute with gusts up to 250. [Laughter] But let's look at what he offers. Change: $150 billion in new taxes before he can get started."", 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. And $220 billion in new spending before he even gets started.', 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. Bigger Government: He talks about Government investing. Government doesn't invest. It's small business that invests and creates jobs in this country."", 'Clinton and the Ozone Man don\'t like to hear this, but -- [applause] -- hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. That\'s fair. ""Ozone Man"" is fair. How about trying a carbon tax on the coal industry here -- what he wants to do. We\'re not going to let him do that.', 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', ""The President.

But nevertheless, I wish you could have heard these guys singing those beautiful gospel songs. It made us -- not a dry eye in the house. These are my friends, and I am grateful to all four of them."", 'Back to the business at hand. The last time we tried the kind of change that Clinton and the Ozone Man are talking about, we had change -- exactly. We had interests rates at 21 percent. We had inflation at 15 percent. We had a ""misery index"" of 20. Now it\'s 10. We cannot go back in the name of change to those failed policies of the past.', ""We're going to win not just on character and trust. We're going to win on a positive agenda. We have the best program for rebuilding our schools, putting the faith in the teacher, putting the faith in the family to have a choice. Give the parents the right to choose public, private, or religious schools, and all schools will be better."", ""We've got the best plan for reforming health care: Make insurance available to the poorest of the poor through vouchers; next income bracket, give them a break through taxes; pool insurance so you get the price down. But do not do what Governor Clinton wants and get the Government in the rationing business. Keep the quality of health care up."", 'At every turn, every turn, Governor Clinton talks about expanding Government. I want to expand the American dream. There is a difference.', 'Now let\'s just talk about character and trust. And let me tell you what this election is about. Here\'s a quote by Horace Greeley. He said, ""Fame is a vapor, popularity an accident, riches take wing; only character endures."" And that is true. That is very true.', 'In the debate, Governor Clinton said it\'s not the character of the President, it is ""the character of the Presidency."" Wrong. They\'re both interlocked. What happens in that White House shapes the character of the Presidency, and make no mistake about it.', ""We have tried very, very hard to uphold the trust. Frankly, in Barbara Bush I think we have a first-class First Lady that has held America in her arms and cares about people. She cares. And when she reads to those children in the Diplomatic Entrance of the White House or holds an AIDS baby in her arms, she's saying two things: We should care about each other, and she's saying family matters, family values matter."", 'So what it boils down to is we simply cannot take a risk on a man who keeps changing his position every single day in order to get votes. You can\'t do it. You know, Kentucky, Fort Campbell and many other places, rallied around when we faced a very critical moment in our history, on the Persian Gulf. I had to make a tough decision, look the American people in the eye, and say here\'s what we\'re going to do. And we did it with the help of the American people. But I would remind you what Governor Clinton said at the time. He said, ""I agreed with the arguments the minority made, but I guess I would have voted with the majority."" You cannot do that as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.', ""Hey, the good one happened the other day. Maybe you didn't see it in the press; I did. Don't read it too much anymore, but I saw this one -- [laughter] -- this one said that Saddam Hussein's government plans a party of 500,000 people when George Bush loses. Saddam, put it on hold, old friend. We're going to come after you until you lighten up on the people of Iraq. We are going to make you live by the United Nations resolutions. He's not going to get rid of us. We're going to keep to it until he does what's right by his people. Frankly, I couldn't care less whether he's unhappy if I win. That doesn't bother me one single bit."", ""So here's what it is. Just picture this: We've dramatically changed the world, dramatically. All these kids here go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war than they had 4 years ago. Now, that's change. You talk about change, that's change."", ""But we're not out of it yet. Governor Clinton and the Ozone want to cut defense by $50 billion more. They are still some wolves out there. We have cut defense. We have cut it, but we must not cut the muscle of our defense."", ""Just imagine if there's a crisis; imagine if we have to face an unforeseen crisis. The question then is this: What American leader will you trust in that kind of a crisis? I do not believe we should put our trust in a man who is all side of every issue. You can't do that in the Oval Office. You have to make the tough decision."", ""I remember well that very cold and rainy February just before our young men and women from Kentucky and the other States were sent into battle. Barbara and I were at the Camp David chapel. And yes, we prayed, prayed hard to do the right thing. We prayed that these young people would come back. And boy, did they ever do this country proud. They did us proud, and don't let them take it away from us."", ""But my point is, this is an awesome responsibility, to ask someone else's son or someone else's daughter to put their lives at stake. It's a responsibility that I have tried to fulfill with honor, duty, and above all, integrity. We must serve this country with integrity."", ""So tomorrow, as we end the long campaign trail in what's got to be one of the most controversial years, certainly probably the most unpleasant year of my life, which is totally unimportant, but I think others know it's been a rather ugly year with this national media just writing us off from day one."", 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. Let me tell you something. We're going to show them they're wrong."", 'So tomorrow is the day of responsibility. I ask you not to take this responsibility lightly. You see, democracy was conceived from liberty, nurtured by freedom, and protected by the blood of those who came before. When you walk alone into that booth tomorrow, you will not spend more than a couple of minutes, but your single voice will echo down the corridor of time. With your vote, you will shape and help shape the entire future of this, the most blessed special nation that the world has ever known and that God has ever created.', ""Never forget, I don't care what they say, never forget that we are one Nation under God, and we ought to be grateful for that."", ""So what we do will cast its shadow forward into history. Your vote -- look at it this way -- it's an act of power, a statement of principle, and a harbinger of possibility. So like all the candidates, I ask only that you think deeply about our Nation and its needs, because tomorrow the polls don't matter. The pundits don't count on election day. Only conscience should be your guide. And never, never let anyone tell you that the United States is a nation in decline. We've got problems, but together we can solve them and lift America up."", ""May God bless you, and may God bless our great country. Thank you so much. Let's go win it. Go to the polls.

I wish him well in the White House. And I want the country to know that our entire administration will work closely with his team to ensure the smooth transition of power.

So we will get behind this new President and wish him well.', ""To all who voted for us, voted for me here, especially here, but all across the country, thank you for your support. We have fought the good fight, and we've kept the faith. And I believe I have upheld the honor of the Presidency of the United States. Now I ask that we stand behind our new President. Regardless of our differences, all Americans share the same purpose: to make this, the world's greatest nation, more safe and more secure and to guarantee every American a shot at the American dream."", 'I would like to thank so many of you who have worked beside me to improve America and to literally change the world. Let me thank our great Vice President, Dan Quayle. You know, in the face of a tremendous pounding, he stood for what he believes in. He will always have my profound gratitude and certainly my respect.', ""I would like to salute so many that did special work: Rich Bond up at the RNC; Bob Teeter, who ran the campaign; Bob Mosbacher; our entire campaign team. They've run a valiant effort in a very, very difficult year. I also want to salute the members of the Cabinet, all of whom who have served this Nation with honor, with integrity, and with great distinction. And I would like to single out two leaders who represent the ideal in public service. Together they've helped lead the world through a period of unprecedented transition. I'm talking, of course, about my National Security Adviser, Brent Scowcroft, and my good friend and fellow Texan, our Secretary of State, Jim Baker."", ""Finally, of course, I want to thank my entire family, with a special emphasis on a woman named Barbara. She's inspired this entire Nation, and I think the country will always be grateful."", ""But tonight is really not a night for speeches. But I want to share a special message with the young people of America. You see, I remain absolutely convinced that we are a rising nation. We have been in an extraordinarily difficult period. But do not be deterred, kept away from public service by the smoke and fire of a campaign year or the ugliness of politics. As for me, I'm going to serve and try to find ways to help people. But I plan to get very active in the grandchild business and in finding ways to help others. But I urge you, the young people of this country, to participate in the political process. It needs your idealism. It needs your drive. It needs your conviction."", 'And again, my thanks, my congratulations to Governor Clinton; to his running mate, Senator Gore. And a special thanks to each and every one of you, many of you who have been at my side in every single political battle.', 'May God bless the United States of America. Thank you very, very much. Thank you so much. Thank you.']"
