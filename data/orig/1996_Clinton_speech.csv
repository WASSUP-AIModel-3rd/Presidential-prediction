0,William J. Clinton ,"October 28, 1993","[""The President. This is not one but two hard acts to follow. I am glad to be back in Queens. And I'm here because I still love New York."", 'I want to say that when I was waiting to come out here tonight, I listened to the choir and the music and my friend Judy Collins. And they were great, and they got me in a wonderful frame of mind. I listened to all of you cheer. I listened to my friend Gary Ackerman tell me that he grew up in a public housing unit called Pominant near here. His mother is right over there. And I want to say right now that the first time Congressman Ackerman visited me in the White House, he looked around at the White House and he said, ""Don\'t feel bad, Mr. President, I used to live in public housing, too.""', 'I want to thank Tom Manton and Carolyn Maloney and Nydia Velazquez and my dear friend Floyd Flake and Gary Ackerman for being my partners in the Congress of the United States. I want to thank Claire Shulman and Freddy Ferrer and Peter Vallone and all the other leaders of the Democratic Party here, and Tom Van Arsdale and the leaders of the House of Labor for giving us a place to meet and a cause to fight for.', 'I want to say a strong word for the rest of this ticket, Alan Hevesi and my friend of many years Mark Green, who will make a strong team when Mayor Dinkins is reelected on Tuesday.', 'And I want to say one other thing. I know I should be mindful of New York every waking minute, but once in a while, just once in a while, you slip my mind. [Laughter] Now, this morning I went out running, as I do every morning, and I wore a cap that I was given the other night when we showed a wonderful movie at the White House about a young man who overcomes enormous odds to fulfill his lifetime dream of playing football at Notre Dame.', 'Audience members. ""Rudy""!', 'The President. The title of the movie is ""Rudy."" I didn\'t realize that when they showed it on the CNN or wherever that there might be some political connotation to that. [Laughter] So when I learned that there was, I remembered that there was another movie made a few months ago that I also liked very much called ""Dave."" So let me tell you, I liked both movies a lot, but when it comes to being Mayor, Dave\'s my man.', 'Ladies and gentlemen——', 'Audience member. We love you, Bill!', 'The President. Thank you.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, I have read some criticism, some of which I sort of understand, from people saying, ""Well, you know, the Vice President and Mrs. Gore and the President and the First Lady, they\'ve all been there campaigning for Mayor Dinkins. What are they doing there? They don\'t have a vote in New York."" Well, we may not have a vote in New York, but we have a stake in New York. How can America do well if New York City or New York State don\'t do well? How can we be the kind of country we ought to be if the home of the Statue of Liberty is not a living example of our liberty and our triumph and the strength of our diversity?', ""I also know that elections always stand for things. The voters of New York, no different than the voters of any other place in America, have been through a long, tough time. For 20 years now, most hourly wage earners have been working longer work weeks for the same or lower wages, when you take account of inflation. For 10 years, many workers have given up all their pay increases just to pay for higher health care costs. More and more when people lose their jobs, they don't get the same job back; they have to get another job. And often it doesn't pay as well or have as good benefits."", ""More and more, people look at the present with some sense of insecurity. All over America I've told the story of the man who worked at a hotel in Manhattan who told me that his son wanted him to support me, but if he did it, he wanted me to make his son free. And by that he meant free to walk to school without fear of being shot or attacked."", ""These are things that everyone in America feels. And when people are frustrated and anxiety-ridden, they naturally tend to vote to change things, whatever it is. Look at the Canadian elections. Look at what's happening in Europe, all over the world: every wealthy country having trouble creating jobs, having trouble giving people higher incomes when they work harder and smarter."", ""We are seeing, my fellow Americans, a lot of problems in the world and a lot of problems at home. I ran for President because I wanted to change that. But here's what I want to say to you. And this is the message I have to everyone in New York, whether like me, a Democrat born and bred, or a Republican or an independent or a member of one of the other parties here: Yes, we must change America."", 'Every day I get up and go to work to do that. Today we saw the deficit this year is over $50 billion less than we were told it was going to be on the day I became President. Why? Because we went after it. We brought down interest rates; we proved you could bring down the deficit. And for the first time in a long time, when you got that report the deficit was smaller, not bigger, than all the politicians said it was going to be. Yes, we need change.', 'Yes, we need more jobs. But in the first 9 months of this administration we have more jobs in the private sector created than in the previous 4 years. Is it enough? Of course not. But we are on the right path.', ""Yes, we need changes in education. Yes, we need changes so we can sell more of our products around the world. Yes, we need all kinds of changes. But here is what I want to say to you: For the people who are laboring to produce change, you should have a reward, not a punishment. If we need better education, shouldn't we reelect a Mayor—without any help in Washington, no help from Washington, found a way to keep the libraries open 6 days a week and to promote education?"", ""If we need health care security for all, shouldn't we reelect a Mayor who's actually got a theory about how to use these public health clinics to keep people well and give primary and preventive services and keep people in a position where they can have more health care for lower costs? I think we should."", ""If crime is a scourge tearing at the heart of America and ripping up families and communities, shouldn't we reelect a Mayor who with no help from Washington put 6,000 more police officers on the street and, not according to his campaign literature but according to the FBI statistics, oversaw a reduction in the total number of crimes reported in all major categories from over 700,000 to over 600,000 a year? Sure, there's too much crime, but if a guy's doing right by it, why punish him? Reward him. Send a message to other people throughout America that you want change and you will reward change, and people will vote for those who have the courage to change. That's what this is about."", ""And tell me, you walk across to your neighboring State where Governor Florio is running for reelection, and you look here, and you see two people who said we need more cops, fewer guns, and we need to do things to give people a chance to have a better way in life; we need to give them something to say yes to, not just tell them no all the time. So we're going to prevent crime, punish crime but give people a chance to escape from a life of crime and from a fabric of destruction. When people are committed to that kind of change, no matter how frustrated, no matter how angry, no matter how hopeless people sometimes feel in their darkest moments, those are the public officials who should be rewarded. How can we make progress if the voters cannot make distinctions between those who fight for the right kind of change and those who do not? This man has earned reelection, and I hope you will give it to him on Tuesday."", 'The other thing I want to say to you is that it is easier to be a good President for New York City and for New York State if you have a good partner at city hall or in the statehouse. It is easier. I know we have a lot of work to do. Today, just today, I asked Congress to act on the vision of Mayor Dinkins and Senator Moynihan so that the Federal Government can work with New York City and New York State to build a new railroad station inside the old post office on 33d Street in Manhattan. For more than half a million commuters every day, Penn Station is the gateway to New York City. We can build a beautiful new station worthy of this great future and this great city.', ""This is the beginning of the kinds of things we must do together. But I need your help. So what if we pass a health care plan—we've got to do that—and every one of your Members of Congress vote for it. How will it work? How will it work? We must still have the clinics in the cities where the people are isolated from care. We must still make sure the great hospitals can prosper and provide care. We must still, in short, have the kind of partnership with this city so that when we pass a bill providing health care security for all of our people, health care that is always there, health care that can never be taken away, it is really there when people show up the next day. That requires a partnership with a Mayor and a city committed to providing quality health care to all the people who live here. That is why I want you to reelect David Dinkins on Tuesday."", 'My fellow Americans, I believe with all my heart the decisions we make as a people in the next 4 to 5 to 6 years will shape America for 50 years. We have finally admitted as a people that we can no longer ignore the great challenges of our age: the great challenges of global economy, the great challenges of crime here at home, the challenge to make a strength out of our diversity, the challenge to educate and train our people better, the challenge to liberate our people from the scourge of fear on the streets. We know what we have to do.', ""We know we can no longer ignore the fact that when there is no investment in these distressed neighborhoods, whether they're in the inner cities of New York and Chicago and Detroit or back home where I come from in the Mississippi Delta, which is still the lowest income part of America, we know we can't ignore those anymore. We cannot let the fact that we know we have great problems blind us to our promise or take away our ability to distinguish between those leaders who have embraced the challenges and change and taken the steps necessary to move to the future, and those who have not."", ""I come here, yes, because I am a Democrat; yes, because David Dinkins is my friend; yes, because I never pass up a chance to come to Queens and New York City. Yes, I come here for all those reasons. But I'm telling you, far more important than all of that, I come here because I believe we need leaders who think children should have a chance to read, who think people should have a chance to live in safe neighborhoods, who believe that we have to have health care that works at the grassroots level, who have plans to put people back to work and give them jobs and hopes, who have embraced the cause of change. And I know that every day, to the best of his God-given ability, in every way he can, David Dinkins gets up and does that. And I know when you give him 4 more years on Tuesday, he will be the best partner the President of the United States could ever have. Do it! We need you!"", 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"
1,William J. Clinton ,"July 30, 1994","[""Well, first, let me thank all of you for coming out to see Hillary and me. We are delighted to be back in Ohio and glad to be back in Cleveland. And I know I started the baseball season here, so I know you're all really thrilled at how well the Indians are doing. And I— [inaudible]—hope there won't be a strike."", ""[At this point, the President's microphone failed.]"", 'Is it working now?', ""Let me just say a—[inaudible]. It keeps dying. Can you hear it now? All right, we'll try again."", ""As you know, I'm here on behalf of Joel Hyatt's campaign. I'm proud to be here helping him. I also want to say how delighted I am to be here with Congressmen Louis Stokes, Sherrod Brown, and Eric Fingerhut. And I want to make just a couple of points."", ""When I came here seeking the Presidency, and Ohio gave me the votes first to be nominated and then to be elected, I knew that this was a State which was really the heartland of America, where people were more or less evenly divided by party but where everybody wanted this country to work again for ordinary Americans. And I made some commitments to you, that I'd work on restoring the economy, bringing the American people together instead of dividing us, making the Government work for ordinary people again, and strengthening our communities and our families at the grassroots."", 'And let me just say that if you look at what has happened, we have worked very hard, often against bitter, bitter opposition, to make this country work. We adopted a plan to reduce the deficit, after the other party had the White House for 12 years and quadrupled the debt, without a single solitary vote from the other side. We passed the biggest deficit reduction plan in history, reduced spending by $255 billion, gave tax cuts to 500,000 working families in the State of Ohio alone, asked 47,000 who can afford it to pay higher taxes to pay the debt down.', ""Now, what has happened? We, the Democrats alone, without any help unfortunately from Congress from the other party, have reduced the Federal Government to its lowest size since Kennedy was President. We have taken $700 billion off the national debt that would have been there before we came in and passed our economic plan. And what has been the result: 3.8 million new jobs, a 1.5-percent drop in the unemployment rate, the largest number of new businesses in any year since the end of World War II. This plan is working, and we need to keep Sherrod and Eric and Lou in the Congress and elect Joel Hyatt to keep America's economy going."", 'The other party, they always talked about how tough they were on crime. But for 6 years, under two administrations, there was no crime bill. Last week, the Members of the Senate and the House voted to put on the floor of this Congress this week the toughest anticrime bill in the history of the United States. So those are two reasons that I ran for President on— restoring the economy, helping to deal with crime.', ""I just want to say one last thing. This last week was a great week for America. The King of Jordan and the Prime Minister of Israel came to Washington to end their war and to pledge to work for peace. And we've been working hard on that. Peace for our children—[inaudible]."", 'After working hard on it for a year and a half, the President of Russia called me and told me that Russian troops would get out of Central and Eastern Europe for the first time since World War II, making the world more peaceful for these children here.', ""But I'm telling you, what we owe these kids is not just peace in the world but peace on our streets and peace of mind. That means we need to pass the crime bill. We need to provide health care for all Americans, and we need to do it now."", ""Let me say to you, I went to Washington hoping against hope and against all the evidence that I could work with people of both parties to make this country a better place. And I have done everything I could to overcome the kind of inertia and opposition we have faced. And I just want you to know, if you like the fact that the American economy's recovering, if you like the fact that we're going to finally do something serious about crime, if you like the fact that after years we voted family leave, we voted for the Brady bill, we voted to make the American people safer, then you ought to keep these people in Congress and send Joel Hyatt to the Senate so we can do things, not stop things. This is a country that's can-do. And we're going to do if you put people in the Congress who believe in making America a better place."", 'Thank you, and God bless you.']"
2,William J. Clinton ,"October 03, 1994","['The President. Thank you. Thank you so much. You have already answered one of my questions—[laughter]—and that is whether you were going to take this laying down or whether you were going to stand up and fight for the future of your State.', ""I am so delighted to be here with all of you, and I'm glad to see Lieutenant Governor Beyer here tonight and all of the other local officials. Toddy, you did a terrific job introducing us, and you ought to be better known than we are. Thank you. And I'm glad to be here with my good friend Senator Robb and with my good friend Lynda and their children. You know, we have been friends a long time. And we have seen a lot of things happen in this country. And Chuck Robb and I, during most of the eighties, were Governors. You heard Toddy talking about what he did for education here, how hard he worked to build Virginia's economy."", ""I want to say two things about our common experience because it really will craft what the differences are in this race. And whether you can get this across to the other voters in Virginia will determine what they do. The first thing was that all during the eighties, we thought, Chuck and I and a number of others, that the Democratic Party had to change, that we had to be identified with mainstream issues, that we had to reach out to a broad base of supporters, that we could never give up our devotion to the rights of individual citizens, to the obligation to fight for equal opportunity, but that we also had to be prudent in spending for economic growth, tough on crime, and facing the relevant problems of the country. That's how we got into the whole Democratic Leadership Mainstream Forum group, to try to move this country forward beyond left and right and beyond all the partisanship that had paralyzed Washington, DC, for too many years."", 'But the other thing that both of us had to do, even to make a career in public life, was to fight against what has been the brilliant strength of the Republicans, particularly the Republicans on the right, for many years now, and that is that they are better talkers than we are and—and listen to me now—and they raise more money than we do to turn their opponents into aliens. Right? [Laughter] How do they do that? They do that by exalting fear over hope, by exalting blame over responsibility, by exalting division over unity. That is what they do. And they are brilliant at it. They sort of try to turn you into a space alien. I tell people—and they are devoted to it. And they are brilliant at saying one thing and doing another.', 'So Chuck Robb and I, for most of our lives, tried to change two things: We wanted to change the Democratic Party from a left-right debate to a forward-backward debate, to broaden our base and move forward; and we wanted to break the stranglehold that the national Republican Party had on ordinary Americans because they were not acting in their interest; they just told them what they wanted to hear and demonized their opponents. Now, here in this election, you see it all being played out again here in Virginia and throughout the country.', ""Three years ago today, I announced for President. And I must say, my mother was the only person who thought I could win that day. [Laughter] The incumbent President was over 70 percent in public approval. But what I didn't like was that we had won the cold war and we were in danger of losing the peace, that the economy was going down, the country was becoming more divided. I did not want my child and the children of this country to grow up to be the first generation of Americans to do worse than their parents. I saw an opportunity for this country to enjoy peace and prosperity, to build a unity out of our diversity, to move into a relationship with the rest of the world unknown in all of human history if only we had the courage, the wisdom, and the good oldfashioned common sense to line up our problems and take them on one at a time and go on into the future. That's why I ran."", 'And I had these grand dreams that I would come to Washington and not only be able to move the country forward but that we would launch—people like Chuck Robb and others and I would launch a new bipartisan debate where people of good faith in both parties would argue about what ideas would best take America into the future and would wind up cooperating on the important issues of the day to move the country forward, knowing that at election time, there would always be enough to argue about. [Laughter]', 'Well, let me tell you what has happened instead. We came here with America suffering from terrible social problems, crime, violence, drugs, family breakdown. They had been developing for 30 years, folks. We came here with America suffering from serious economic problems where many, many wage earners were working longer and longer and longer and never getting a wage that kept up with inflation and often losing jobs and taking lower paying jobs because of the pressures of a global economy.', 'And we came here after 12 years in which Presidents of the other party had talked tough about our problems but acted soft. They railed about the deficit and quadrupled the debt. They railed about the Government and put their folks in all the Government jobs they could get. They talked tough about crime, but all they did was talk. Every single issue was talk.', 'We\'ve been here 20 months, folks. And now the Republicans are saying, ""Well, if your problems aren\'t all solved, it\'s just because the aliens have taken over Washington."" [Laughter] Isn\'t that right? ""They don\'t share your values. They\'re for big Government."" You know all the things they say.', 'Well, look at the record. We have made a good beginning that matters to America. The next time you hear their space invaders speech—[laughter]—you ask them this: Well, how do you explain the fact that we have passed the biggest deficit reduction package in history, the largest number of spending cuts in history, and tax rates went up only on the top 1.2 percent of our people; that we made 90 percent of the small businesses in this country eligible for a tax cut and reduced taxes on 15 million working families to keep them out of welfare and in the work force; that while were cutting spending, we increased investment in education and training and new technologies and defense conversion; we expanded trade by more than any comparable period in 35 years.', ""And what has that produced? They said the sky would fall. You remember? The same crowd that is campaigning against Chuck Robb said the sky would fall. Well, instead, we have 4.3 million new jobs, 130,000 in Virginia alone; 330,000 families in Virginia alone were eligible for income tax cuts; 600,000 people in Virginia alone, today, already eligible for lower interest college loans. We've had 3 years of deficit reduction in a row for the first time since Harry Truman was President. And we have reduced the size of the Federal Government already by more than 70,000—270,000 over 5 years. The Federal Government will be the smallest that it has been since John Kennedy was President. That is the record of this administration."", 'Now, that is why Chuck Robb pleads guilty to voting for that economic plan: It produced for the people of Virginia. Republicans and Democrats got those jobs. Republicans and Democrats got those tax cuts. Republicans and Democrats will get those lower interest college loans. It was good for the people of Virginia.', 'Chuck Robb hates deficit spending. And when I reeled off all this to him in private, he said, ""It\'s a good start, but you\'ve got to keep going."" [Laughter] The difference is the other guys want to go back.', 'Let me give you the second example. We have made a good start in fighting the crime and the social problems that are gripping America: 100,000 more police on the street; 100,000 more jail cells for violent criminals; ""three strikes and you\'re out""; the assault weapons ban, over the opposition of the NRA. And we\'ve made a start in making Government work for ordinary Americans again.', 'Now, what have they done?', 'Audience members. Nothing!', 'The President. They have done—oh yes, I wish that were the answer. [Laughter] I came to Washington with all my dreams that we\'d be able to work together. The first week I was here, I was told by the leader of the other party in one of the Houses of Congress—listen to this—I was told, ""You\'re going to have to pass this economic plan without one single, solitary vote. It doesn\'t matter how you change it. We\'re not going to vote for any tax increases on the wealthy. And if it fails, we\'ll be able to blame you. And if it works, we\'ll attack it and call it a tax increase anyway,"" which is exactly what happened. But he said, ""No point in you even talking to us. You won\'t get a vote."" So I sort of waited 8 months; we passed it anyway. They said the sky would fall, and the economy is booming.', 'Then last year they voted 42 to 2 for the crime bill. Last year they voted for the assault weapons ban; they voted for prevention programs—all those things they call pork, they voted for, they sponsored a lot of them—42 to 2. Why? They did not believe the House of Representatives would pass it.', ""So then, when the crime bill comes back this year in the Senate—I want you to understand what you're thinking about doing here, what the consequence of this race is—all of a sudden, all of those prevention programs they voted for, they sponsored, that on an annual basis they were spending more on in their bill than in the one we finally passed, they went from 42 to 2 for it, to 6 to 38 against it. Why? Because they were told the objective was not to lower crime but to hand a political defeat to the administration and to the Democrats. That's why."", 'Let me give you another example. On health care, when I introduced the health care bill, I said, ""Look, I don\'t have a monopoly on truth. You may have a better idea."" And I was so happy. I thought, finally, we\'re going to get there because 24 members of the other party, 24 Republican Senators, were on a bill that would have provided coverage for everybody and would have controlled costs. So, anyway, so they had 24 Republicans on this bill. So I said, ""Great, we\'re going to get health care."" That\'s right. I said, ""We\'re going to get health care."" And I thought, they\'ll have ideas; we\'ll have ideas; we\'ll get together and we\'ll work out a deal. We\'ll have health care—24. By the time the bill got to the committee process, do you know how many of those 24 were left? Zero. Why? Why? Why? Because—because—don\'t take my word, take their word. Republican Congressman says, in print, ""We were ordered not to cooperate on health care."" Republican Senator says, in print, ""We have killed it. Now the trick is to keep our fingerprints off of it""— in print; Republican idea person says, in print— passed it out, proud of it—to the Republicans, ""The one thing you must not do is pass any health care reform. It will help the Democrats too much.""', 'Now that is what we are facing. That is the national context in which you must see this election. But far more important than that is they have now told us what they will do. They have put their contract out. And what is it? Trickledown economics; eighties promises; a trillion dollars worth of unfunded promises, $1 trillion.', 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. I'll tell you what that contract is. It's a contract on America's future. It's a contract on our deficit reduction. It's a contract on Medicare. It's a contract on paying for the crime bill. It will take us right back down the road that we were on before if you do not change the direction of the country. So I say to you, let's don't quit. We have made a good start in 20 months on 30 years of social problems, 20 years of economics problems, and 12 years of neglect."", 'I want to say something else. If you say, ""I want the same thing from Chuck Robb today that I did when I voted for him for Governor: I want a mainstream, progressive, bipartisan, commonsense effort to move this country forward""; if you say, ""I am sick and tired of this demonization; I am sick and tired of this distortion of a good man\'s record and a good man\'s life and a good person\'s public service""; if you say, ""I will not reward people who talk tough, just tell me what I want to hear, pander to my every whim, and act weak when they have power; I will instead reward people who make tough decisions and think about my children\'s future, and Chuck Robb has done that every day he was in public office from the first day I elected him""; if you say, ""We don\'t want to demonize our opponents either, but we have values, too, and we can read the rules, too, and we know that one of the rules that sometimes the other side forgets to mention in their litany of values is ‘Thou shalt not bear false witness""\'—let me tell you something, the people of this State are good people. They are good people, regardless of their party or their background or their experience. They can only vote in this election based on what they know, what they see, what they feel.', ""Now, let me end where I began. We've made a good start in 20 months on 30 years of social problems, 20 years of economic problems, 12 years of neglect. But most people have not felt it yet. And while we have been working, they have been talking, blaming, dividing, turning us into aliens."", ""You, you can decide whether we go forward or backward. We've moved the economy; we've taken a serious step on crime; we've begun to make Government work for ordinary people again. They have put out their contract on America. They want more of trickle-down economics, more of inequality, more of division. You can decide."", ""But the voters who are not here at this rally tonight can only vote based on what they know. There is a mountain of money raining down on them at home tonight while you're here with us, coming through the television screen, playing on people's paranoia, their disillusionment over the years, their frustration, their cynicism. You have to break through it. And you can do it."", ""But paying to come to this rally is not enough. You've got to talk at work. You've got to talk on the weekends. You've got to talk to your friends. You've got to talk. You've got to work. You've got to walk. Do not take this lying down. Do not take this lying down."", ""This is your State. It is your country. It is your children's future. Go take it back. Thank you, and God bless you all.""]"
3,William J. Clinton ,"October 11, 1994","['Thank you very much, Alex, for your introduction and for your work. And especially, thank you for not giving up on the Mustang.', ""I'm delighted to be here with Alex Trotman and Owen Bieber. And I want to thank all the people from Ford and from the UAW who made it possible for me to be the first President ever to visit this plant and to take the tour and to see the new Mustangs and to sort of regret I couldn't drive out of here with one. [Laughter]"", ""Mayor Archer, it's good to see you. Mr. McNamara, ladies and gentlemen, thank you all so much for coming here today."", ""I guess it's not much of a secret to you that I own a 1967 Mustang, so I have been out of the market for a while. When I left Arkansas 20 months ago, I think it was the thing I most regretted leaving behind. Of course, all the drivers in my State were elated, but I miss it anyway. [Laughter]"", 'I want to tell you how very proud I am of Ford, of the UAW, the American auto industry generally for what you have done to put America on the move again, to rebuild our position globally in auto manufacturing, to strengthen manufacturing in America, and to give us a better chance to move into the 21st century. Ten years ago, a lot of people were willing to throw in the towel on the auto industry. But you fought back, labor and management, together. And now for the first time in a good long while, you are number one again, not only here but in the entire world, and you ought to be proud of yourselves.', ""I want to say to you that the fight you have fought is the fight I am fighting for America. I want us to be number one again. I want us to be able to compete and win in the 21st century. I don't want our children to be the first generation of Americans to do worse than their parents. And I believe the future can be the best time America has ever had if we have the discipline and the courage and the vision to stick with it and go forward and do what we know we ought to do."", ""I've been in a lot of tough fights in my life and none so tough as the one I've been in in Washington for the last 20 months. But it's been a good fight. It's a fight to give Americans the power to compete and win and to empower all Americans to live up to their God-given potential, and we have made a good start."", ""No one would want to go back to the days when we exported jobs, not products. No one would want us to go back to the days when our deficit was exploding and our economy was going downhill. That is exactly the decision that all of you are going to have to make on November 8th, whether we keep going in the right direction or go back to the 1980's trickle-down economics."", ""You remember the folks in the other party; they talked a good game. But trickle-down economics gave us an economy stuck in reverse: tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans, higher taxes on the middle class, a quadrupled deficit, jobs going overseas. Most manufacturing jobs that were ever lost in this country were lost in that period. And in their last 4 years, we had the worst job growth since the Great Depression. Michigan alone lost almost 70,000 manufacturing jobs during that time. Well, I don't think we want to go back to that, where families struggle longer and harder for less, where we come apart when we ought to be coming together."", ""The American people really hired me to try to change all that. It wasn't easy, and I knew it wouldn't be. But I ask you to remember this: We've had 30 years in which we've been developing serious social problems with our families, our communities, the crime problem, the gang problem, the drug problem. We've had 20 years when most working people have worked harder for stagnant wages. And we tried 12 years of trickle-down economics. After 20 months, I think it's plain that we've made a beginning in turning this country around. And I hope you'll say it's plain that you don't want to go back, you want to go forward into the 21st century."", ""I ask every American in the next 4 weeks not just to think of their discontents with the political system, although there's plenty of good reason to be discontented, but remember the problems we found 20 months ago. Remember the progress we're making. Remember how many of them fought us every step of the way. And remember now what they want to do to take us back, when we have so much to do to keep going forward."", ""We cannot turn back again. We're headed in a new direction, with a new idea about what our National Government ought to do: not a Government that ignores our problems but not one that promises to solve all the problems for us either, but instead, a Government that empowers citizens to build good lives of their own; not more Government but less Government that works better for ordinary Americans. Look at the start that's been made:"", ""The family leave law, which in Michigan alone provides extra protection for 1.5 million working people so they can succeed as parents and workers; it's a very important thing. Nobody should lose their job when a baby is born or a parent's sick."", ""Immunization for all American children under the age of 2 by 1996, 2 million kids that are going to have a better chance at a better life. That's something that ordinary American families ought to be able to expect of their Government."", ""Apprenticeships for young people who don't go to college but want good jobs. Every young American ought to have a chance to train for a good job in a 21st century economy."", ""College loans affordable for 20 million people, almost 600,000 right here in Michigan, eligible for lower interest, longer term, better repayment college loans so that now no young person should ever decline to go to college because of the cost of a college education, the burden on the student, the burden on the parents. It's the most important thing that's been done for middle class Americans in a very long time by the National Government, and we ought to stick with it."", ""We sent a welfare reform plan to Congress to end welfare as we know it, to move people from welfare to work. And while it hasn't passed yet, it will. And we've already given 17 States permission to get rid of all Federal regulations that undermine their ability to move people from welfare to work."", 'For the first time in a generation, we\'ve also begun a serious assault on crime, passing the Brady bill and the crime bill with ""three strikes and you\'re out,"" a 20 percent increase in the number of police officers on the beat in America—already in Taylor, nearby here, they\'re getting more police officers, and you will see it in every community in this country—100,000 more prison cells to hold serious offenders, and prevention programs to give young people a chance to avoid a life of crime.', ""We've begun, finally, to put our economic house in order. When I took office, we had had 12 years of exploding deficits and declining incomes; we had quadrupled the national debt. Before I could do anything else, folks, I had to get our economic house in order, and we had to do something about this terrible deficit. It was choking the economy and robbing our children of their future. So we fought for historic deficit reductions, $255 billion in Federal spending cuts. We did raise tax rates on the top 1.2 percent of Americans, but we cut taxes for 15 million working Americans. In Michigan alone, that means 41,000 families had higher income tax rates and 390,000 families had lower income tax rates to encourage those people to work instead of going on welfare."", 'Now, when I proposed this economic program, the same folks that exploded our deficit in the eighties said if this passes, the sky would fall; the deficit would go up more; the economy would collapse; it would be the end of the world. And so every last member of the Republican Party in the Congress voted against that program, every single one, against the deficit reduction, against the college loan program, every single one.', ""So what happened when they said the world would come to an end? Well, for the first time since Harry Truman, we're bringing the deficit down 3 years in a row. We had more jobs created in high-wage industries this year than in the previous 5 years combined. We've had 9 months now of growth in manufacturing jobs in a row for the first time in 10 years. America was voted the most productive country in the world by the annual panel of international economists for the first time in 9 years. And we have 4.6 million new jobs in America in the last 20 months."", ""Our exports are up around the world. We're selling all kind of things we never sold before, not just automobiles; we're selling rice to Japan for the first time, something I'm very proud of—and Mustangs to Japan, I might add. Exports to Mexico are up 19 percent; exports of cars and trucks are up 500 percent, 500 percent. If we pass the world trade agreement, it will enable us to get more high-wage jobs tied to exports. We are doing that."", ""So what are we doing? Putting our economic house in order, making a serious assault on crime, making Government work for ordinary people again. The other thing we're trying to do is to do it with less Government, not more. Republicans talked forever about how much they dislike the Federal Government and how they wanted to cut bureaucracy and inefficiency, and they're saying it again this year. I just want to remind you that it was our Democratic administration that passed laws to reduce the size of the Federal bureaucracy by 272,000, to make it the smallest it's been since John Kennedy was President, and to give every last dollar of the savings to you in your local community to fight crime. That is the record that we have made in reducing the Federal Government."", 'Now, you may say, ""Well, that\'s all fine, Mr. President, but my life is still pretty tough,"" or ""My neighbor still doesn\'t have a job,"" or ""I\'m still not sure what the future holds."" Well, no one can promise you to repeal the laws of change that are sweeping through the world today. What we have to do is to make change our friend.', 'What are the problems we still have in America? Too many people still haven\'t gotten a raise in a long time. A million Americans lost their health insurance last year. We have too many people who are trapped in the cycle of welfare. We have social problems that are profound. These are legitimate problems. The political system needs some internal reforms. That\'s right, we have problems. What you have to say to yourself is, ""Who is more likely to meet these problems? Who is more likely to seize these challenges?""', ""Look at what the strategy of our administration is. It's to create more high-wage American jobs, train more Americans to do those jobs, bring free enterprise to poor inner-city areas and rural areas that have been ignored for too long, continue to fight for political reforms, and meet the challenges of America that have not yet been faced in health care, in welfare, and in so many other areas. That is our strategy, fighting for the future."", ""Now, consider instead what their strategy is. Look what they've done just in the last year. Whenever they were faced with an idea that created jobs or educated students or fight crime or reform the political system, no matter how good it was, no matter even if they had already supported it, what did they do? You remember what they did, just in the last couple of weeks. They tried to stop it, slow it, kill it, or just talk it to death."", 'Congress should have passed a bipartisan health care reform bill with private insurance, consumer choice, cost constraints, and universal coverage. Instead, we watched another year go by where health care costs rose faster than inflation, over a million Americans lost their coverage, the cost of health care exploded the Federal deficit. Why? Because the other guys walked away from every attempt we had to compromise this issue.', ""Congress should have passed a lobbying reform and a campaign finance reform bill and made all the laws that they apply to private employers and employees apply to themselves. And they passed both Houses. Why did those laws fail? Because in the end the Republican congressional leadership delayed them to death. It is wrong when a Senator of the other party can filibuster lobbying reform, which Senator Levin has worked so hard for for so long, and then walk off the floor of the United States Senate and be cheered by a crowd of lobbyists for killing it. But it happened. Well, the lobbyists may be cheering, but I don't imagine you are."", ""The Republican leadership blocks change in Washington, and then they go home and tell you how hard they're fighting the Democrats to change the way things are. They say one thing in one place and another in another."", ""Look what else they blocked that affects Michigan. In the 11th hour they blocked the passage of the Superfund legislation to clean up toxic waste dumps. You know who was for that? Every industry group, the labor groups, and the Sierra Club. It's the only time in history the chemical companies and the Sierra Club have agreed on anything. There was nobody in America against passing Superfund except the Republican leadership. Why? So we wouldn't be able to stand up here and celebrate the passage of Superfund."", ""There's a bill you care a lot about in Michigan that was blocked that would give local folks some control over the interstate transportation of solid waste. Not very many people were against it, but it was blocked. Why? For political reasons. The same can be said for a lot of other bills."", ""Well, now the same folks that blocked these bills have come forward with what they'll do if you give them control of Congress. They call it their Contract With America. Three hundred and fifty Republicans stood on the steps of the Nation's Capitol with the leadership and one by one signed this contract. I'll give them credit for at least doing that. For 2 years, I couldn't get them to say anything they were for. [Laughter]"", 'But if you read this contract, it\'s not a contract with America, it\'s really a contract on America. It takes us back to the 1980\'s, to trickle-down economics. Look at what they do: They promise everybody a tax cut, although 70 percent of it goes to the wealthiest Americans; they promise to increase defense and to start up Star Wars; they promise a trillion dollars\' worth of things. I wish I could come here and do that today, just tell you exactly what you want to hear. ""Here\'s a trillion dollars. Go spend it.""', ""You give me a trillion dollars, and I'll show you a good time, too. [Laughter]"", ""But since it's just a bunch of promises, what does it mean? Same thing it meant in the 1980's. It means exploding the deficit, shipping our jobs overseas, cutting Medicare and veterans benefits, not funding the crime bill. It means a lot of terrible things, because you simply cannot go around this country making idle promises to people that you cannot keep. We must not go back to that sort of politics."", ""So I hope the American people will have a simple answer to this contract. We've been there. We've seen that. We've tried it. And we will not be fooled again. I offer you a difficult and more challenging contract, but the only one that can work. It's the contract that had always worked for America. It is fighting for the future, making the most of the potential of every American. It is doing whatever it takes to compete and win in the global economy of the 21st century. It is doing with our Nation what you have done here at this Mustang plant. That is what I offer you: more jobs, a lower deficit, more education for our kids, competing in the global economy, doing the things that will make America work again so that these fine young people in their musicians' uniforms will be able to grow old, when they're like me and they have to give up their horns, and they'll still have a life they'll be proud of."", 'Look, I read all these stories about how angry the voters are and how fed up. Well, let me tell you something: I showed up in Washington to work 20 months ago, and since then I have been amazed and often angered at some of the stuff I see. I have been bewildered at the resistance to change from time to time. And I know that both parties bear some burden, and I know that even the President is not perfect. But remember this: When it came to change, we were on the side of the future.', ""When we offered a plan to cut the deficit and provide college loans to the middle class, they all voted against it. When campaign finance reform and lobbying reform came up to change the way the political system worked, most of our party voted for it. Most of them voted against it. On the crime bill, which had always been a bipartisan effort, where over 90 percent of both parties' representatives voted for it last year when there were no politics, most of our folks were still for it, just where they were last year. But they changed and voted against it for politics."", ""So you have a choice. We are fighting for a 21st century in which America goes forward, competes, wins, every American lives up to the fullest of his God-given potential. We refuse, even though it's tempting, I guess, from time to time, to take the easy way out and give you a trillion dollars' worth of unfunded promises. That is their contract."", ""We have a covenant for the future. They put out a contract on the future. I think the choice is clear. I want to ask you to help ensure America, through all the frustration and anger, does not inadvertently vote for what you're against and against what you're for."", ""Look to the future. Think of your children. Stand up for tomorrow. And remember, it's not so different building a country than it is building a car. You have to think about the tasks, you have to face the hard jobs as well as the easy ones, you've got to work together, and you've got to always be thinking about tomorrow."", 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"

And I want to congratulate Mark Roosevelt on giving debating lessons to the Republican Party in the last few days."", ""I loved Ed Markey's speech, except he said everything that Ted and I wanted to say.

I thank Ed Markey."", 'I want to say one thing a lot of you may not know. This is serious. I want to thank Ed Markey because last spring he called my attention to the fact that we had one million military assault-style weapons coming into this country from China. And he said we ought to stop it, and we did. And I thank him for that. And I also want to thank him for paving the way for the information superhighway in Framingham and all along Route 128, the birthplace of high technology and the future of the information superhighway. Thank you, Ed.', ""Ladies and gentlemen, until the last few days this had the earmarks of an unusual election, where people were in danger of voting against what they're for and for what they're against because of the inordinate success of our opponents in talking things to death and confusing things, but the fog is beginning to clear in America."", ""Twenty-one months ago, you sent me to Washington to try to change this country, to make Government work for ordinary people, to bring the economy back, to make the world more peaceful and more prosperous, and basically to make us feel like we were going in the right direction again and that we were coming together again, that we could recover the American dream, that we could get to the next century with all the children in this room looking at America's best days ahead of us. And I come here to tell you that we've still got a long way to go, but America's in better shape than it was 20 months ago."", ""I know there are a lot of people who want jobs who still don't have them. I know there are a lot of people who are working hard who haven't gotten a raise. I know that another million Americans in working families lost their health insurance last year. I know we still have crime problems and social problems. But I ask you to think of this: the social problems, the crime, the drugs, the family breakdown, the things that are gripping this country, they've been developing over 30 years. The economic stagnation of working people, wage earners, has been a problem for 20 years. We had 12 years of trickle-down economics, of failed economic policy that ignored the problems or made them worse."", ""And in 21 months, we've got more jobs, lower deficit, the Government working for ordinary people, a serious assault on crime. We are moving in the right direction. We don't need to turn back now. We need to go forward into the future."", ""I believe most Americans, without regard to their party, support the family and medical leave law. I believe they do. In Massachusetts alone, 11⁄4 million working people in Massachusetts alone can now take some time off when there's a baby born or a family member sick or an elderly person in trouble in your family without losing your job. I believe most people are for it. Well, we voted for it. Most of them were against it. I believe most people in this State and this country think the Brady bill is right, think it is right that we're immunizing all the children in this country under the age of 2 by 1996, believe it is right to expand Head Start. I believe they like these things."", ""These are the changes we are bringing. I believe most people in this country think that Senator Kennedy's bill to provide national service to give kids a chance to work in their communities and solve problems at the grassroots level and earn money for a college education is a good thing that looks to the future. It is not a relic of the past."", 'I believe most people in this country like the fact that we have reformed the student loan program and made 20 million Americans eligible for lower interest rates and longer repayment terms on their college loans, for middle class Americans; 840,000 people in Massachusetts alone eligible to benefit from this program immediately. I think most Americans are for it. Every single Republican in the United States Congress voted against it. And we gave it to the United States, and I think the people are with us and not with them.', 'I believe most people in the United States think it was right for us to lower the taxes of 15 million working families, people working full time with children in the home, because they had modest wages. No one should work full time and raise kids and be in poverty. We can do better than that. I think people are for that. In Massachusetts, 184,000 working families had their taxes lowered under our economic plan. And every one of the Members of Congress of the opposite party voted against it.', ""Now, they said if our economic approach passed, instead of what we said, the deficit would explode and jobs would go away. That's what they said. Well, we've had plenty of time now, and what have we got? It was the Democrats, not the Republicans, under our approach that reduced the size of the Federal Government, that lowered the deficit 3 years in a row for the first time since Truman, that oversaw an economic recovery that produced 4.6 million new jobs—and a 2 1/2 point decline in the unemployment rate in Massachusetts alone. They were wrong in what they said."", 'Now, do we still have problems? You bet we do. There are still environmental challenges. There is still political reform. There is still welfare reform, And yes, there is still health care reform to face. But you should vote for the agents of change, not the agents of yesterday.', ""I want to tell you something, folks. The ironies of this election continue to abound. Imagine this: Suppose Massachusetts had a Republican Senator—no, wait, wait, wait; no, listen— suppose Massachusetts had a Republican Senator who had voted for legislation to make the Federal Government the smallest it's been since John Kennedy was President, to reduce the deficit 3 years in a row, for economic recovery that produced an explosion of new jobs, for the toughest crime bill in a generation to be paid for by reducing the Federal Government, not with new taxes. The Republicans would be building a statue to this person. They should be building one to Ted Kennedy because that's what he voted for."", 'So when you hear them spouting their liberal epithets, you know, ""Liberal, liberal, liberal,"" you say, ""All we know is, you guys didn\'t reduce the size of the Federal Government. We did. You guys talked about a crime bill. We passed one. You guys badmouthed the deficit. We lowered it. You guys talked about the economy. Our economy is coming back."" Let us reward the agent of change. Let us reward people like Senator Ted Kennedy.', 'Now, let me ask you this. I want you to draw this clear contrast. I was talking to several people just in the last week about Senator Kennedy, you know, because they say, ""Oh, he\'s been there too long."" I\'ll tell you something, you talk to anybody in Washington of either party who will tell you the truth, and they will tell you two things about your Senator. Number one, there is not a single, solitary Member of the United States Senate more interested in new ideas than he is, new ideas for the economy, new ideas for education, new ideas for the future. And the second thing they will tell you is that in the most partisan atmosphere in modern history, he is absolutely the ablest Member of the Congress at getting Republicans to vote with him and work with him to make this country a better place.', ""Now, that is the choice you face: a program that's working, new ideas, an approach that is fair to people of all parties. What is the alternative? Look at what they did in the last week of the legislative session. They said no to environmental legislation. They said no to political reform. They, the Republican Senators, killed the Superfund bill to clean up toxic waste dumps. Everybody in America was for it, the chemical companies, the labor unions, the Sierra Club. We never had a bill that all those people agreed on. They couldn't agree on when the sun comes up in the morning. There was literally—there was nobody in America against the Superfund bill except more than 40 Republican Senators. And why? Because they would have rather left the poison in the ground than let Ted Kennedy come home and say he helped to clean it up. That is wrong. We can do better than that. We must go forward. We can do better."", 'And let me tell you this: You take this contract on America they put out very seriously, and you look at it. You look at what it does. They promise you—listen to this, it sounds great, made my ears perk up when I heard it—""Give us power, give us power, and we will increase defense, revitalize Star Wars, give everybody a tax cut—mostly to the wealthy, but we\'ll tell you about that later—and balance the budget."" Presto.', ""Does that sound familiar? It's a trillion dollar deal. Now, folks, this is election year. It is almost election time. I would love to make you a trillion dollars' worth of promises. And with a trillion dollars' worth of hot checks, I could show everybody in this house a good time tonight. [Laughter] We could have a good time."", 'But the job of people and responsibility is to do right, not hold out false hopes. It is not to sacrifice the future of our children to give people a quick fix today. This is wrong, this contract, and we must say it is wrong, and we must vote against it, and we must stand against it. This is wrong.', 'If you let them do this, they will take us back to where—do you remember what it was like in Massachusetts and New England in the eighties? They will explode the deficit. You\'ll have cuts in Medicare. You won\'t have any more statements like, ""I\'m helping you with your water rates, or your sewer rates."" They will never fund this crime bill to bring the police to the streets of your communities to make them safer. These things will not happen. We\'ll start shipping jobs overseas again, and they\'ll put the economy right back in the ditch, all the time trying to find somebody else to blame.', ""Stand up against this contract.

I want to thank Maria Cantwell for a lot of things, but especially for working so hard, along with Senator Murray, to make sure Washington continues to be a center of innovation in software and computer technology, to work with government and industry partnerships to make sure that this is part of our 21st century economy and part of your 21st century future.

Instead of somebody that postures about being tough on crime and then votes against the crime bill, you've got a guy who goes out and puts his life on the line to try to fight crime and violence and give kids a better chance at life. Instead of pontificating about family and work, you've got a man who's worked all his life, raised a good family, and then spent a fair amount of his time trying to make sure everybody else could raise their family, too. So I hope you will bring him home in the next 2 weeks, and I want to say more about that. But I can tell you it will not only be good for you, it would do the rest of the United States Senate, especially the crowd on the other side, a world of good to have to deal with somebody who's actually lived about the things they spout off about all the time."", 'Folks, I think it would not be an overstatement to say that this is kind of an unusual election.

I wanted to do it by supporting work and family with things like family leave and tax cuts for working people who work full time and have kids in the home that are just barely above poverty, and they ought never to be in poverty if you work full time and you got kids in your house. I wanted Government to be on the side of ordinary Americans by empowering people so they could assume responsibility for their own lives. That's what our bill to have school-towork apprenticeships was about, so that young people that don't go to college can at least train for good jobs. That's what the middle class college loan program was all about, to give lower interest rates and longer repayment terms so that nobody—I mean, nobody—ever walks away from a college education because they're afraid they can't afford to go or will never be able to pay their debts back."", ""With 30 years of accumulated social problems, I wanted a serious attack on crime and violence. That's what the Brady bill and the crime bill and all of its facets was all about. That's what our welfare reform efforts, to liberate people so they can succeed as parents and workers and won't be on the dole for a lifetime—that's what that is all about."", ""I wanted to get this economy going again. That's what bringing down the deficit and investing more in new technologies and expanding trade for Washington State and all the other States in the country—that's what that was all about, to get the economy going again. And I wanted to change the way the Government works. I wanted us to do more with less. There are more than 70,000 fewer people working for the National Government than there were the day I took office. There will soon be a reduction in the life of this budget of about 270,000. Our Government will be the smallest it's been since John Kennedy, and every cent of the savings will go back to you at the grassroots to help you fight crime and build a more just society."", ""I wanted to make a world more peaceful and prosperous. That's what all these trade expansions are all about. That's what's selling all this high-tech material and products and the airplanes and the apples—that's what it's all about, letting people prosper in a global economy. I wanted you to be safer. And that's why I'm so proud of the fact that these little children are the first generation of Americans since the dawn of nuclear power that do not have Russian missiles pointing at them. I am proud of that, glad they will not have to worry about a North Korean nuclear power threatening their future, glad the Chinese have agreed not to sell their dangerous missiles."", ""I wanted a world in which we could have a more peaceful and prosperous and democratic future. I'm proud of what we did in helping the election in South Africa and the peace process in Northern Ireland and standing up to Saddam Hussein and bringing Father Aristide back to Haiti. I am proud of what we've been able to do to contribute to peace in the Middle East. And I hope you will pray for me and all those in the Middle East next week as we try to take the next big steps."", 'Now that I told you this, let me ask you this: If Jim McDermott and Norm Dicks and Maria Cantwell and Mike Kreidler were Republicans running for reelection, and they said, ""Look, I gave you the smallest Federal Government since Kennedy, 3 years of deficit reduction for the first time since Truman, an explosive amount of economic growth, and finally some high-wage jobs coming back into our economy and the toughest crime bill in history,"" the Republican Party in Washington would be building a statue to each of them, not running against them. What is this? Isn\'t that right? Isn\'t that right? [Applause]', ""What is going on here that they say these people are the apostles of big Government and they're wildly liberal and they're for taxes? Eight times as many Washington citizens got a tax cut as a tax rate increase in our economic program. Don't you forget that."", ""How could people believe this? What is going on? Well, I'll tell you something, we live in a time when the negative is louder than the positive. The American people will nearly always, nearly always do the right thing if they know what it is. It used to be people didn't have enough information; now they have too much. And sometimes the people—and it's not all true, and it's hard to know what's relevant and what's irrelevant and what's important and what's not important. And people are just screaming at them all the time, trying to keep them in a turmoil, upset, agitated, disoriented. That's what our adversaries try to do. They figure if they can make people mad enough and disoriented enough, they'll just lash out at whoever's in and they will forget about what's happening."", ""I was telling some folks this morning that a few months ago in one of my rarer times when I had a little time to reflect, I sat down with a pencil and a piece of paper, and I made out a list of everything I'd ever done in my life to make a living, from the time I went to work in a grocery store when I was 13, to clearing land, to cutting grass, to building houses, to having a wholesale comic book operation. I've done a lot of interesting things. And the thing I was trying to think of, is there any job I ever had that's like the job I've got now? [Laughter] And was it Governor? Well, Governor was a little like it, but the job that's most like the one I've got now was one I didn't ever make any money at. It was when I was in civic clubs in high school, and we used to do car washes to raise money. Kids still do that, don't they? And I liked to be the guy that wiped off the windshield. That's kind of what we need to do now."", ""You think about it: If you're driving a car around and the windshield's all dirty, you'll think it's about to storm if the sun's shining bright. And if there are lots of things on the window, you'll think there's all kind of problems in the road, and it's just as clear as can be. And if it's really messed up, there may be a problem out there, and you won't see it, and you'll run smack dab into it. [Laughter] That's what I've got to do. We've got to wash America's windshield off in the next 2 weeks so they can see the light coming in."", ""I look at Ron Sims; I think of the life he has lived and the values that virtually pour out of him when he talks. And I think, I don't believe most people in Washington State want a Senator who voted against family leave, against college loans, against tax breaks for low-income working people, against deficit reduction, voted for the crime bill and then against it when it became a political deal. I don't think they want that."", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. These people—you know, I don't think they want a Government that just screams and shouts and says no, no, no, no, a Government of fear, not hope; a Government of blame, not responsibility."", ""You know, look what happened in the Senate at the end of this session. In the 1800's we had a filibuster, that is, a talkathon, about once every 6 years. And people said, well, once every 6 years something will come along, and you don't want to rush it; you just ought to talk it to death to make sure you're doing the right thing. And then in the 1900's we got more verbose, and we've had about one a year. The partisan atmosphere has gotten so intense that in the last week, on the last weekend of this session of Congress, we had four filibusters on four different issues in one day. That is what they are doing."", ""You take—let me just give you one example, the Superfund bill that their delaying tactics killed. There was nobody in America against the Superfund bill, hardly. We had the chemical companies and the labor unions and the Sierra Club. Shoot, those folks never agreed on anything. You couldn't get them to agree on what time the Sun was coming up tomorrow morning. [Laughter] But they agreed on the Superfund bill. They wanted to clean up those toxic dumps. Nobody in America was against it except slightly more than 40 Republican Senators. And they knew that no way we could ever get it up. And why were they against it? Because they would have rather left the poison in the ground than let Maria Cantwell and Mike Kreidler and Norm Dicks and Jim McDermott come back here and say they helped to clean it up. That is the truth."", 'And so I say—and now they say, ""Give us power and we\'ll—give us power, we\'ll give everybody a big old tax cut, especially if you\'re really rich. And we\'ll spend lots more on defense, and we\'ll spend lots more to revitalize Star Wars, and we\'ll balance the budget."" [Laughter] Does that sound familiar?', 'Now, that costs a trillion dollars. You say, ""Well, how are you going to pay for this?"" They say, ""We\'ll tell you after the election."" [Laughter] You know how it\'ll be paid for? You know what it would take? It would take a 30 percent across-the-board cut in every program in America. What will happen is just what happened before. It will explode the deficit. It will lead to unwise cuts—and we have cut Government; they haven\'t—and it will lead to shipping our jobs overseas instead of bringing them back home to Washington State.', 'We have to say, ""We tried that once. Thank you very much. We don\'t want to go back to the trickle-down economics and the divisive social policies that you gave us before. We don\'t want to go back. We don\'t want to go back.""', ""I want you to think about this. I want you to think about this in the 2 weeks and a few days that remain. We've still got a lot of challenges in this country. We've got economic challenges. We've got social challenges. We've got important political reform and environmental and health care and welfare challenges to face. But this country's in better shape than it was 21 months ago. We have a Government that's done some important things for ordinary Americans. We've taken a serious stand against crime. There are more jobs. There is a lower deficit. It is a more peaceful world. We are in better shape."", 'What we need to do now is to say to the American people and to say to the people in Washington, ""Look, it\'s up to you now. You\'ve got to keep going into the future. You don\'t want to turn back now. You\'ve got to choose hope over fear. You\'ve got to empower people, not let somebody grab power with a bunch of cheap promises from yesterday. You have got to look at the future as it is and look at the facts as they are.""', ""We've got to have everybody here thinking about what I did as a little boy. If you'll go out and you'll wipe off the windshields, if you will turn the lights on in Washington State, you will have Ron Sims for a United States Senator, and you will have these Congressmen back, and we'll have America going forward into the future."", 'Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you. You can do it. You can do it.', ""One more thing. Don't you dare walk out of here and just think about the cheering. Spend your time for the next 2 weeks talking to people who weren't here. Go have a cup of coffee with your neighbor. And if they're mad and upset and fuming, ask them to relax, take a deep breath, look at the pretty fall coming on, and talk about your country. The people of this country will do the right thing if they know the facts. And each of you should make a personal commitment to doing that, not only for them but for these kids here. You can do it. Turn the lights on. You can do it.""]"
7,William J. Clinton ,"October 31, 1994","[""The President. Thank you. It is good to be home, and it's good to be back in Philadelphia. Thank you."", ""Let's give a big hand to the George Washington High School Band. [Applause] Weren't they great? Thank you. Thank you."", 'Senator Wofford, Lieutenant Governor Singel, Members of Congress, Mayor Rendell, City Council President Street, Democratic Chair Bob Brady, District Attorney Lynn Abraham, our State senator and nominee for Congress, Chakha Fattah, and my fellow Americans. It is wonderful to be here on behalf of these fine people.', 'You know, Harris Wofford doesn\'t always vote with me, but he always votes for you, and you ought to keep him there. I read the endorsement in your distinguished local newspaper, which said, ""Harris Wofford has been America\'s conscience when we need it. He has the record, the heart, the vision that has done Pennsylvania proud, and he deserves reelection."" I couldn\'t say it better than the Philadelphia Inquirer did.', 'And I read the endorsement of Mark Singel, which said that he has the better vision, a better program, mentioned his positions on education and welfare reform, two things I like to think I know something about, that are absolutely critical for any Governor. And it said, and I quote, ""His blueprint for Pennsylvania is so much stronger, he deserves the chance to put it into action."" And I hope you\'ll give it to him.', 'Just before I left for the Middle East, I challenged the American people to think hard about this election, to look at the record, to look at the future, to shine some light on a debate that had been pretty muddied up until a couple of weeks ago. Well folks, the Sun has begun to shine in this election.', ""Every day more Americans are beginning to know that the real issue here is, who will fight for ordinary Americans, for their future, for their families, for their jobs, their children's education, their parents' Social Security, their security? Who is going to be in this on your side for tomorrow? The answer is, we are. And you need to help us win on November 8th."", 'This election represents a simple choice between going forward and going back. Twentyone months ago, with the enormous help of the people of Pennsylvania and a terrific mandate from the city of Philadelphia, I moved to Washington to try to change this country, to try to make our country and our Government work for ordinary citizens, to try to get this economy going again, to try to make sure that every American was prepared to compete and win in this tough global economy.', ""Remember the challenges we faced when I went there? We'd had 4 years of the slowest economic growth since the Great Depression; 4 years in which Pennsylvania had lost 8,300 jobs—no gain, a loss. We were dealing with 12 years of trickle-down Reaganomics, which exploded our deficits and sent our jobs overseas, divided our people. We were dealing with 20 years of stagnant wages as people struggled just to hold on to their jobs with more and more uncertainty in a rapidly changing economy. We were dealing with 30 years of developing social problems in the family and on the streets with crime and violence and drugs and gangs. No one thought this could be turned around overnight. But I can tell you, my friends, after 21 months, we're beginning to make a difference, and we need to keep going."", ""Look at the record. We passed the family and medical leave law, which enables over 2 million Pennsylvania workers to be able to take some time off when there's a baby born or a sick parent. Senator Wofford voted for it; his opponent voted against it."", 'We passed the student loan reform law which enabled 20 million Americans, including 1.7 million in Pennsylvania, middle-class folks, to borrow money to go to college on better, more affordable terms. Senator Wofford led the fight; his opponent voted against it.', ""We passed the national service bill, a domestic Peace Corps, to say to the American people, look, if you'll go back to Philadelphia and you'll go to work on those streets and you'll help kids one-on-one in trouble, if you'll do something to help solve the problems of America and give some of your time to building our country from the grassroots, we'll give you some money to go to college. Senator Wofford led the fight; his opponent voted against it."", ""We cut income tax rates for 15 million working families, including over 500,000 families in Pennsylvania, people who work full time, have children in their homes, but have very modest wages. Why? Because we don't think anybody who works full time and has kids in the home should live in poverty. That is our policy. Senator Wofford supported it; his opponent voted against it."", ""We passed a budget that cuts spending by $255 billion, that cut the Federal bureaucracy by 272,000 positions. We changed the way Government buys things to make it more competitive, so you won't have to read about a system that produces those $500 hammers and $50 ashtrays anymore. Senator Wofford led the way on that."", 'Now, when we implemented this economic strategy last year, do you remember what they said, the other guys, the people that are opposing Harris Wofford and Mark Singel? Every one of them voted against the economic strategy. They said, ""Oh, if you do this, you will ruin the economy. You will explode the deficit. You will lose jobs. America will be in terrible shape."" Well, they were wrong. They have launched the most vicious attacks, often misrepresenting what was in that program, on every Member of Congress who stood up and gave America a chance to go into the future. But they were wrong.', ""What are they going to say? The deficit's going down 3 years in a row for the first time since Truman was President. We have a budget that is reducing the Federal Government to its smallest size since John Kennedy was President. There has been a new study, as it comes out annually, of international economists, saying that for the first time in 9 years, America has the most productive economy in the world."", ""You know, believe me, I know we've still got a lot to do. I read the story of the Philadelphia worker who said he was a part-timer in '92, and he wanted a full-time job. He's still got a part-time job; he doesn't know whether he should vote or not. Well, I have a message. Between '89 and January of '93, your State lost 8,300 jobs. In the last 21 months, your State has gained over 86,000 jobs. We're going in the right direction. Let's don't turn back now."", ""Imagine this folks, imagine if Harris Wofford were a Republican Senator running for reelection. No, don't boo. Keep in mind, we're all preaching to the saved today. You've got to go reach somebody else between now and election day. So, think of this. If Harris Wofford were a Republican Senator running for reelection, if these Members of Congress were Republican Members running for reelection, and they had voted to reduce the deficit, to shrink the size of the Federal Government, for the toughest crime bill in American history, to explode the economy after years of stagnation, the Republicans would be building statues to them and saying we were unpatriotic for opposing them. And they ought to be building statues to them anyway and reelecting them here today."", ""And instead, what are they doing? Now, they're trying to say no to the progress we have made. Three hundred and fifty of them went to Washington the other day and signed a Contract With America. It's a trillion dollars' worth of promises."", ""Now, listen to this: big tax breaks, mostly for the wealthy, billions more on defense, revive Star Wars, balance the budget. Does that sound familiar to you? We've heard that before, haven't we? And you know what will happen. If they get control of the Congress and that's their program, you'll explode the deficit, ship jobs overseas again. You'll have cuts in Medicare, cuts in student loans, cuts in veterans' benefits. We will never fund that crime bill that Ed Rendell talked about."", ""The worst news is that the Republican contract could devastate Social Security and senior citizens. The House Budget Committee says to meet their program, the contract they signed, they'd have to cut Social Security about $2,000 a person a year and Medicare about $1,800 a person a year. That's $3,600 a year out of the most vulnerable people in this country, people who have worked hard all their lives, people who have paid their taxes, people who have paid their dues. That is wrong. That is wrong, and we must not allow it to be done."", ""I know. You know, you hear something like this, it's just incredible. You can hardly believe that they did it. But don't forget, President Reagan tried to do it in '81. The House leader proposed it in '86. Mr. North, the Senate candidate of the Republicans in Virginia——"", 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. ——he just proposed making it voluntary Social Security, which means killing it. And now Senator Wofford\'s opponent says that he wants to raise the retirement age to 70, and I quote, ""further if I could."" Well, he can\'t do that if you don\'t let him.', ""So I say to you, say no to this radical attack on Social Security. Say no to billions more in tax breaks that explode the deficit and send our jobs overseas. It all sounds so good, their pretty promises, a trillion dollars' worth of promises. You know, it's a week from the election, folks. We'd all like to stand up and make you a trillion dollars' worth of promises. That's real money. We could all have a good time on a trillion dollars' worth of hot checks. [Laughter] But it would be wrong."", 'We need men and women in the Congress who will keep their promises to middle-class America, their promises to our future. They need people up there in Washington who understand that when you work all your life, you deserve the peace of mind that Social Security and Medicare give you because you have earned it, not a Government handout but a contract for people who say, ""We\'ve done our part,"" and the rest of us say, ""A job well done.""', ""So, my fellow Americans, that's it. That's your choice a week from today. This country's in better shape than it was 21 months ago. We've got more jobs, a lower deficit, a Government doing things for ordinary people in a world that is safer and more secure and more prosperous. We have a long way to go until everybody who wants a job has one, people who work hard get a raise, people who don't have health care get it, and people who have it don't lose it. We've got a lot to do, but the way to do it is to keep going forward, not to turn back."", ""You know, I just want to close with this thought. You know I just got back from a pretty arduous trip, and I hope I'm doing all right today. I'm still a little jet-lagged. I want to tell you something. Brave people in every part of this world are struggling and fighting for freedom, for democracy, for prosperity, for security, whether it's Israel and her Arab neighbors, the people in the Persian Gulf where our brave soldiers are, the people in Korea who want to make Korea all a nonnuclear peninsula, the people in Northern Ireland trying to bury hundreds of years of hatred, the people in South Africa trying to build their democracy, the people in Haiti welcoming home President Aristide. These people all over the world are trying to do this, and everywhere they wish to have America's support for their courage because they admire our values and they admire the strength of our system and they admire our willingness to change. They believe in us. And we need to believe in ourselves, just as much."", 'Folks, this country is not still here so many long years after the Founders first came here to Philadelphia because we took the easy way out, we listened to the easy promises, we let people divide us and play on our fears. We are here because we voted our hopes, because we voted for unity, because we voted for the future, because we had the courage to change, we looked to the future with hope and optimism. Others look at us that way. If we will look at ourselves that way on November 8th, you will elect Harris Wofford. You will elect Mark Singel. You will elect these Members of Congress who are here.', 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"

I think western Pennsylvania is lucky to have somebody who fights for improvements in the Mon River locks in Turtle Creek, Elizabeth, and Charleroi myself, and you ought to keep Harris Wofford if for no other reason.', 'I read the endorsement of Senator Wofford in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. And he said, contrary to the paid ads of his opponent, I want to quote: ""Senator Wofford is not an advocate of mindless big Government. He understands Government can\'t possibly solve all the problems in a nation, that personal responsibility and accountability must be engendered and demanded. He remains committed to a mission built on service and opportunity, hope and humanity, vision and realism. Harris Wofford is a direct descendant of the enlightened public officials who gave us Social Security and Medicare, those lifesaving programs. His opponent is not."" couldn\'t say it better myself.', ""My fellow Americans, 21 months ago I went to Washington with the help of an overwhelming vote from the people of Pennsylvania, with a commitment to make Government work for ordinary Americans, to get the economy moving again, to prepare our people to compete and win in the global economy, to make the world more secure and more prosperous for Americans to live and work in. I called it putting people first. Well, you know, we still have problems. There are still people who want jobs who don't have them, people who are looking for a raise that hasn't come, people who are worried about losing their health care. There are still problems with crime in our streets and social problems in our communities. But I'll tell you something, folks, look at what we found: 4 years of the slowest job growth since the Depression, 12 years of trickle-down economics that blew up the deficit and drove our jobs overseas——"", 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. ——20 years of stagnant wages, 30 years of social problems. And after 21 months we are clearly moving in the right direction. We are in better shape than we were before.', 'I read in one of the papers today, a voter saying, ""Oh, I\'m sort of disillusioned. I don\'t know if they\'ve done anything for ordinary Americans."" Well, here is what we\'ve done for ordinary Americans. We passed the family and medical leave law. Over 2 million working Pennsylvanians with family members can now take some time off when there\'s a child born or a sick parent without losing their job. We passed college loans for the middle class for lower interest, longer repayment terms, so that everybody can go to college. Over 1.7 million Pennsylvanians can take advantage of that. We passed the national service program, thanks to Harris Wofford\'s spirited leadership. Our economic program had tax cuts for over 500,000 working families in Pennsylvania with children in the home living on modest wages, because we, the Democrats, don\'t believe if you work full time and you\'ve got a kid in the house you should be in poverty. We want to reward work and parenting. We voted to expand Head Start and to immunize every child in this country under the age of 2 by 1996. And on all those issues, Wofford was yes; his opponent was no. We\'re making Government work for ordinary citizens, thanks to people like Harris Wofford.', ""We made a serious assault on crime for the first time in a generation with tougher punishment, more prison space for serious offenders, more police for our streets, and prevention programs for our kids to keep them out of trouble in the first place. Every last Republican who voted against that crime bill knows that every law enforcement organization in the United States supported it. And a bunch of them voted for it the first time; then it became election year, and they flipped and voted no. They didn't care about lowering crime. They wanted a political issue. Harris Wofford voted to lower the crime rate in Pennsylvania, and you ought to reward him for it."", 'And we voted to put our economic house in order: $255 billion in spending cuts, 272,000 fewer people working for the Federal Government, gave all of the money to you to fight crime in your local communities. We voted to change the rules by which we buy things; no more $500 hammers and $50 ashtrays for us now. And when we did this, what did our opponents say? They said, ""If you do this, we will bankrupt the economy. The economy will go down. The deficit will go up."" Well, they were wrong. Look at the results: in 21 months, 4.6 million new jobs. In Pennsylvania in the previous 4 years, you lost 8,300 jobs; in this 21 months, 86,800 jobs in the State of Pennsylvania.', 'Do you know that if Harris Wofford were a Republican running for reelection—now don\'t boo, listen, because you need to go out between now and then and talk to people who are not for him yet, who are not for Mark Singel yet, who haven\'t made up their mind how they\'re going to vote in these congressional races. And I want you to think about this. If Harris Wofford were a Republican running for reelection, and he got up and said this: ""I should be reelected, my fellow Republicans, because I did what you\'ve been begging for for years. I reduced the deficit 3 years in a row for the first time since Truman. I am giving you the smallest Federal Government since John Kennedy. I have given the toughest crime bill to the American people in a generation, and I have voted for policies that are growing this economy for a change""—if he were a Republican, they\'d be building a statue to him.

They said no to everything—no, no, no—no to middle class college loans, no to family leave, no to everything. They refused to compromise on health care. They killed lobby reform. They killed campaign finance reform. They even killed the Superfund bill to clean up toxic waste dumps.', 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. It was an amazing thing, folks. We had the chemical companies, the labor unions, and the Sierra Club all for the bill. It was almost spooky. They don't agree on when the Sun's coming up in the morning.

A big part of what I said in '92 was that I would give primary attention to our problems at home because we couldn't be strong abroad unless we were strong at home, but that we could not withdraw from the world, we had to be involved in the world. We had to expand trade, and we had to make the world more secure and more free. So we've expanded trade. And I'm going to Detroit tomorrow. You know what the biggest problem in Michigan is today?

When we came here 21 months ago, you elected me President to change this country and to move this country forward, to face up to 30 years of social problems, 20 years of economic stagnation, 12 years of their trickle-down economics, and 4 years of the worst job growth since the Great Depression. We said we could change that, and we've been working at it steadily, to make this Government work for ordinary people, to get this economy going again, to empower people so they can compete in this global economy, and to make this world safer and more secure."", ""And I tell you, folks, there are still a lot of problems in America, but we have made a very good start.

You heard the mayor talking about the crime bill: more police, more prisons, tougher punishment, and prevention to give our children something to say yes to as well as something to say no to."", ""We brought down the deficit that the other party only talked about. We slashed the bureaucracy they only complained about. We cut the regulations that they gagged over but never did anything about. When we put this economic strategy forward, the Republicans said if it passed, the economy would collapse. Well, they were wrong. In 21 months we have cut the deficit 3 years in a row for the first time since Truman was President. We have shrunk the Federal Government, but we have invested more in your jobs, your future, and we have 4.6 million new jobs in America. In Michigan, we've seen a 1 1/2 percent plus drop in the unemployment rate."", ""Is there more to do? You bet there is. Yes, there is.

In Michigan alone, 580,000 people will be eligible for better terms on their college loans because of this administration and its partners in the Congress.', ""And let me just say this. I noticed that Mr. Carr's opponent ran a television ad using my voice against him, saying if it hadn't been for him we wouldn't have passed the economic program. Well, that's why your unemployment rate is down; that's why your jobs are up; that's why this country is moving forward."", ""But I want to give you another one, and I bet you won't see this in his television ad. If it hadn't been for Bob Carr, we would never have had the votes to reform the student loan program; we wouldn't be having 20 million more Americans eligible for lower interest rates, lower costs, better repayment terms. If the other fellow had been there, it never would have happened. And that's the kind of choice we're facing in this election."", ""What have they done? They said no to student loan reform. They said no to the crime bill. They said no to family leave. They said no to the reduction of the deficit. They said no to economic recovery. That's what they did.

Does it sound familiar?', ""Their contract on America doesn't say much about how they're going to pay for this.

Vote for the Democrats, and keep this country moving forward."", 'Listen to this. This is their argument. This is their argument. They say, ""Well, this is a tough election for Republicans. The Democrats took our issues away. We were always for jobs, against crime, against big Government. We were active in foreign policy. Now, the Democrats have given us 3 years of deficit reduction in a row for the first time since Truman, the smallest Federal Government since Kennedy, the toughest crime bill ever, a growing economy in a safer and more secure world.

We will throw a smokescreen over the election. We will attack them for big Government and taxes, even though they cut taxes on working people and gave us less Government and moved the economy forward and made the country safer.""

10,William J. Clinton ,"November 01, 1994","[""The President. Thank you. I've had a good time tonight, haven't you?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Mr. Stephenson, you play that horn a lot better than I do, but I love listening to you. You were great, and I thank you; You were great, and thank you, sir. And I thank the Cleveland School of the Arts for that wonderful rendition of ""Lift Every Voice and Sing."" Weren\'t they magnificent? They were great; we thank you. When I\'m not as hoarse as I am tonight, I can sing that song—[laughter]—even the second verse.', 'Reverend McMickle, I\'m honored to be in your beautiful church tonight; honored to be here with so many distinguished pastors, upstairs and down, and so many other concerned citizens. I\'m glad to be here with the mayor, who sounded a little like a preacher tonight. [Laughter] When I heard Mike up here talking, it reminded me of what my grandmother said to me the first time she heard me give a speech. When it was over, she came up to me—my grandmother was about 5′ 2′′, weighed about 180 pounds. She was one tough cookie. [Laughter] You\'ve all had grandmothers like that. So I gave this speech and I was pouring my heart out, and she looked at me and she said, ""Bill, I believe you could have been a preacher if you\'d been a little better boy."" [Laughter]', ""You've made a fine mayor and a good friend; I thank you, Mike White. Mr. Pinkney, I thank you for your work on this event tonight and for your service to our community. And my good friend Lou Stokes, what a fine man he is and what a great leader he is. I'm not sure, I think this is my third visit to Congressman Stokes' congressional district, maybe my fourth, but however many it is, it's however many he told me I was going to make. When I am summoned, I am here. [Laughter]"", 'I want to say a special word of thanks, too, for the presence of some other people here: First, your wonderful Senator and my stout friend and a great leader for this whole country, Senator John Glenn, I appreciate his being here today. My friend and State chairman, your attorney general, Lee Fisher, I want you to reelect him on Tuesday. Lee Fisher is a good, good attorney general.', ""And I want to say something about a couple of other folks who are here. Barbara Sykes, stand up, stand up. I'm going to use Barbara's story as a little illustration about the difference between us and them. Barbara Sykes is from my home State. She's from Arkansas. And she was my political director here in Ohio. And a lot of you know Ohio made me the nominee of the Democratic Party and made me the President of the United States; I got my 276 electoral votes from when Ohio was declared. So now she's running for State treasurer. And not in Cleveland where it would hurt him but down south, in the typical way these Republicans are—they say one thing one place and another, another, and hope they don't get caught— [laughter]—there's a big newspaper article today about how her opponent is running a picture down south, where I'm not supposed to be popular in the State, of her having her picture turn into me and turn back into her."", 'Now, I don\'t know what her relationship with me has to do with her fitness to be State treasurer or not, but since he raised it—[laughter]— since he raised it, I hope all the Ohio press gets this straight. Her opponent says, ""She was Bill Clinton\'s political director, and she\'s from Arkansas,"" like it\'s some sort of podunk place, right? What has that got to do with being State treasurer? ""I, on the other hand,"" he says in his ad, ""I was the chief aide to Jack Kemp at HUD""—[laughter]—""and therefore I ought to be the State treasurer because I\'m better at counting money.""', ""Well, let me tell you something. I like Mr. Kemp; as those Republicans go, he's got some good ideas. But he's had some zingers, too. Jack Kemp was one of the guys that told President Reagan that you could increase spending and cut taxes and balance a budget at the same— [laughter]—right? He didn't go to the Cleveland public schools, or anyplace else. He forgot about arithmetic. [Laughter]"", ""And we went all through the 1980's with their money counters. We quadrupled the debt of the Federal Government. We sent our jobs overseas. We put our economy in a ditch with their economic theory. That was trickle-down economics. Now he wants to count your money? I'd bet on her any day of the week. [Laughter]"", ""I'm glad to see your distinguished and very handsome candidate for Lieutenant Governor there. And I'm glad to see some other people here. Congressman Sawyer is here. He's come all the way from Akron with some of his folks. He is a great leader in the Congress. I hope and pray he will be reelected on Tuesday."", ""Congressman Fingerhut met me at the airport. He may not be here, but since he's from around here, in some of the Cleveland meetings here I want to talk about him. You've seen those ads they're running against him? Oh, it's the awfulest thing you ever saw. [Laughter] He's one of—why would they be spending so much money to beat a first-term Democrat who is as independent as can be? I'll tell you why. Fingerhut's great passion in life is to clean up the influence of the lobbyists in Washington. He wants to pass this lobby reform bill and require them to report all the money they spend. He's got this crazy idea that you ought to know how much the organized interests in Washington spend to keep from having your interests furthered down there. So they are going bananas. And they're trying to beat Fingerhut, and they're saying all these terrible things about him. But I want to tell you something. When you see those ads, the reason they're trying to beat him is, if he comes back, he will pass the lobby reform bill that the Republicans killed this time because we ran out of time. That's what they're trying to do."", 'Now, this is kind of like this treasurer\'s deal I was telling you about. A few weeks ago when the Republicans were already counting all their victories on Tuesday, convinced they were going to win, they beat the lobby reform package, and they beat campaign finance reform at the end of the last congressional session. This was on a Saturday. On a Monday, the House Republican leader meets with the lobbyists in Washington, and he tells them—this was reported, big front-page story in the Washington Post— ""Now, we took care of you. You better take care of us. And you\'d better not give any money to those Democrats because we\'re keeping score.""', 'The next day, it\'s in the paper that he met with a bunch of Republican political operatives and said, ""Our goal in life is to convince people that the President is the enemy of normal Americans. We\'re going to make it unsafe for him to go anywhere except to talk to black voters between now and the election."" That\'s what he said. Let me tell you something, folks. This whole country would be better off if every person in public life felt as comfortable in this church tonight as I do.', ""So if you can do anything for that young man, Eric Fingerhut, you ought to. He voted to get this country moving in the right direction. But the real reason they're out to get him in your neighboring district is they don't want that lobby reform to pass, and he will bust a gut to pass it if he gets reelected."", 'Now, Mr. Hyatt here, who\'s been my friend a long time—I\'ve known him longer than nearly anybody in this church—he wants to be a Senator. And his opponent, oh, he\'s said all kind of terrible things about him. But let me ask you something: If you had a chance to vote for a guy who had built a business giving people legal services who had to have it and couldn\'t afford to pay big money for it; creating a lot of jobs for people; who\'d been terrifically successful and then said, ""Because I\'m successful, I need to give something back to my State and my country, and I want to go up there and fight for ordinary Americans, not for organized interests. And I\'m prepared to pay my fair share of taxes, and I\'m prepared to do my part. I want to move this country forward,"" and the fellow running against him had been one of the people who brought you the trickle-down Reaganomics that nearly bankrupted this country, wouldn\'t you vote for Joel Hyatt? I think you ought to, and I hope you will.', ""Let me remind you of something else, too. The man that's running against Joel Hyatt 2 years ago was running against John Glenn when I was running for President. And I was coming to Ohio all the time, following this election very closely. Now, you may not agree with every vote Senator Glenn ever cast. He and I have a disagreement once in a while. But one thing nobody will ever question is that John Glenn is one of the most distinguished, patriotic Americans in the 20th century. Nobody could question that. I'm going to come back to this in a minute. But in 1992, the same man who wants to beat Joel Hyatt today ran against John Glenn and, because he had a lot of money to put ads on television, thought he could get away with actually questioning Senator Glenn's patriotism. I have just this to say to him: When you go fly all those planes full of bullet holes and you get in a spaceship and go up by yourself in space, then you question John Glenn. Otherwise, be quiet and do something else. Do something else."", ""This is an amazing year, you know; I mean, it's a strange year. And I was glad to hear the pastor quoting the Scripture. There's a lot of things we need to think about. You can go back in the Scripture, and you can find times like this when things seemed sometimes upside down. But I can tell you this: We're a week out from this election, and the clouds are beginning to clear, and people are beginning to see what this election is all about. The election is about whether we're going to keep going forward, or whether we're going to turn around and do what got us in the trouble we got in in the first place. That's really what the election is about."", 'You know, 21 months ago I became President, thanks to you. [Applause] Thank you. And I had a program that I thought would help take our country into the 21st century, to rebuild the American dream by putting the American people first. I had some very specific commitments I made. I said, ""If you will vote for me, here\'s what I want to do: I want to make Government work for ordinary Americans again, to do more with less. I want to empower you and then challenge you to do what it takes to compete in this fast-changing, global society. I want to get this economy back on its feet again. I want this world to be a more prosperous and a safer place for Americans to operate in. And we can do that if we\'ll take the challenge."" Well, 21 months later we haven\'t solved all the problems in this country, but we\'re in a lot better shape today in America than we were 21 months ago.', ""If you look at it, we're making Government work for just working people with families and jobs. That's what the family and medical leave law was all about. It protects 2 million people in Ohio who might need to take a little time off from work because there's a baby born or a parent sick, without losing their job. That's what our economic plan was all about when we lowered taxes for 500,000 working families in Ohio who are working full-time with children in the house who should not be in poverty. We ought not to tax people in poverty. We ought to lift them up if they're working and doing their best to raise their children."", ""That's what we were doing when we passed the Brady bill and the crime bill with more police, more prisons, more punishment, but more prevention, too, to give our kids something to say yes to and a chance to avoid a life of crime and trouble and misery and instead make something of themselves so they can lift their voices and sing. That's what that crime bill was all about."", ""And we have begun to empower people more. We've started a program to help every State set up apprenticeship programs for people who don't go to college but want to be in good jobs, not dead-end jobs. We provided a dramatic increase in lower cost college loans so that everybody can afford to borrow the money to go to college. And they'll have easier terms to pay it back, so they can always afford to pay it back. It is a big deal, and we need to celebrate it and use it. One million students in Ohio alone are now eligible for lower cost, better repayment college loans. That is something that can change the future of the State as well as of the people involved. That is making the Government work for ordinary people. That is empowering people. That's not giving people anything except the tools to make something of their own lives."", 'And we said we\'d get the economy going again. And so I gave the Congress a long-range economic plan: expand trade, invest more in education and technology and defense conversion, and bring the deficit down. And when the Congress voted on our deficit reduction program the Republicans said, ""Oh, my goodness, if this plan passes, the sky will fall. The economy will collapse. You ought to do it the way we did. Tell everybody what they want to hear, and let the debt go crazy, and let the economy run off the track. But at least you won\'t make anybody mad."" I said, ""Our job is to take responsibility. Better to make a few people mad and straighten things out and get us on the right road."" And that\'s what we did.', 'So what has happened since our opponents said the sky would fall? Well, the unemployment rate in Ohio fell 1 1/2 percent. And now 4.6 million new jobs have come into our economy. And in the last 3 months the economy expanded at a healthy rate of about 3.4 percent with no inflation—1.6 percent inflation. In other words, the economy is coming back. We were right, and they were wrong.', ""And who could fail to be pleased that for the first time since we had nuclear weapons in two countries there are no longer any Russian missiles pointed at our children tonight? There are the elements in place of an agreement that will keep North Korea from becoming a nuclear power. We've been on the side of peace and freedom everyplace from the Persian Gulf to the Middle East to Northern Ireland to southern Africa to Haiti. This world is for Americans a more prosperous and a safer place than it was 2 years ago."", ""Do we have problems yet? You bet we do. There are still people in Cleveland that want a job that don't have one. There are still people in Cleveland that haven't gotten a raise in years. There are still people in Cleveland worried about losing their health insurance or afraid they'll lose their job and won't be able to get another one. Yes, there are problems. What is the answer to the problems? The answer is keep on doing what works. Don't turn around and go back and do what didn't work. That's what the answer is. And that's why you need to vote on election day and make sure all your friends do."", ""Our Republican friends, they're an interesting lot in Congress. They want to kill things and then blame us for not having them pass. They tried to kill the crime bill. They attacked the crime bill for its prevention programs, even though they had cosponsored a bunch of them. They thought they wouldn't get caught. And they delayed, as I said, they killed the lobbying bill, the campaign finance reform bill."", 'They killed the Superfund legislation. A lot of you don\'t know what that is, maybe, but that was the bill to clean up the toxic waste dumps of the country. That\'s a big problem, you know? Everybody was for the bill. We had the chemical companies and the labor unions and the Sierra Club, the environmental groups. There wasn\'t anybody against that bill except enough Republican Senators to delay it to death. Why did they want to delay it? Because they didn\'t want Lou Stokes to be able to come home and be able to say, ""I helped to clean up poison waste dumps."" They said, leave the poison in the ground and try to put some poison in the political atmosphere. I say it\'s time to take the poison out of the ground and out of the political atmosphere and start building this country again and doing what\'s right for the people of America for a change.', ""Now, our Republican friends say if they get to go to Congress, they've got the answer to all of our problems, their Contract With America. I called it a contract on America, and it upset Mr. Hoke. Come to find out, I wasn't sure they knew what was in it, he and his AA. They asked me all those questions in Cleveland last week. [Laughter] I'll tell you what's in it. It's a sweet deal. They come to you and—I come to you with challenges; I tell you there are things you're going to have to do. I can pass the crime bill; you've got to fix crime in your neighborhood. You've got to take this and use it, use the police, use the prevention programs, use these things, and you do it. I passed the college loan bill; I'll tell you, you've still got to go to college. [Laughter] I can't do it for you."", 'What do they say? They say, ""Oh, we\'re going to give everybody a tax cut."" They don\'t tell you almost all of it goes to very wealthy people. ""We\'ll give everybody a tax cut, and we\'re going to increase defense, and we\'re going to increase Star Wars. We\'re going to bring that back, and we\'re going to balance the budget."" Sounds great; how are you going to pay for it? ""We\'ll tell you that after the election."" [Laughter]', 'That was the theory, by the way, of the fellow that wants to be the treasurer: ""We\'re going to cut taxes, raise spending, and balance the budget."" I wouldn\'t let anybody count my money that had that idea. [Laughter] And that was their idea; so they want to do it all over again. Now, I\'m going to tell you what\'s going to happen. If you raise this spending and you cut all these taxes and you balance the budget, the only way to do it is to cut Social Security and cut Medicare, and that\'s wrong. And we\'re not going to let them do that; that\'s not right.', ""And if they don't mean it, if they're going to run and hide—boy, they're running for cover on that now; we pointed out what the math was—if they don't mean it, the only other alternative is to explode the deficit and drive the economy in the ditch and send our jobs overseas just like they were before. And I say we have to tell them we have been there, we have tried that. We don't want to cut Social Security and Medicare and college loans and veterans benefits, and we do not want to explode the deficit and put the economy in the ditch. No thank you very much. We'll keep going forward. We do not want to go back."", ""I got to thinking about this, folks. It's frustrating for them. They ran against the Government for years, you know; the Republicans said how much they hated the Government. Now we have reduced the size of the Federal Government. They ran against the deficit, even though they gave it to us. We have reduced it. They said they were for a strong economy. We got more jobs. They said they were interested in foreign policy. Our country is safer and more secure. So how are they getting away with having a close election? Why is Joel Hyatt in a close election? Why isn't Tom Sawyer and why isn't Eric Fingerhut and why isn't Lee Fisher—why aren't they being elected overwhelmingly? Because the American people have been told for so long that things are so bad, and they've been told they ought to be cynical and skeptical and nothing good ever comes out of Washington. Can anything good come out of Washington? That's in the Bible somewhere, too, right? [Laughter] And they remind me now of another Biblical verse because they're often straining at a gnat so they can swallow a camel. [Laughter]"", 'So what is their theory? Their theory is, just deny that we did these things. Shoot, if a Republican President had reduced the deficit, reduced the size of the Federal Government, passed a tough crime bill, and promoted economic growth, they\'d be saying it\'s unpatriotic to criticize the man. [Laughter] You know they would. I can hear it now in all their talk shows: ""How dare they criticize our President. He reduced the deficit. He reduced the size of the Government. He grew the economy, and he got tough on crime."" What do they do? They just deny that it happened.

Thank you for this wonderful welcome, and thank you for being about twice as large a crowd as we thought we\'d have and for being so good-humored about us losing the sound. I want to thank, first of all, the bands from Cranston East and Cranston West High School. Let\'s give them a hand. [Applause] You know, folks, when I ran for President, my slogan was ""Don\'t stop thinking about tomorrow."" And there are a couple of people here with signs that say that today. But one of them is right down here with a group of people who are tomorrow, from the Maryville Elementary School. Welcome; glad to see you. I am delighted to be here today with my good friend Senator Claiborne Pell who just came back with me on our mission of peace to the Middle East. And I thank him for his leadership for Rhode Island and for America.', ""I am delighted to be here and to be introduced by Myrth York. And I want you to help her win this election next week. I read in the papers that she is an underdog. Well, I was an underdog—wait a minute, that's not a bad thing. I was an underdog when I started running for President. Nobody but my mother thought I could win. And then I was underdog two more times. I got up; I went down; I got up; I went down. The only election that matters is the one that the voters in Rhode Island are going to have next Tuesday."", ""The thing that impresses me about Myrth York is that she understands that the first job of Governor is to prepare the State for tomorrow's economy, to have Rhode Island moving strongly into the future—[applause]—commends her, and I want you to elect her on Tuesday."", ""I also want to say a few words about the others who are here. Linda Kushner sponsored and supported the Rhode Island family and medical leave act. I believe in that sort of policy. We need more of that in the Congress, not less. I want to say a special word of support for my friend, representative, soon to be Congressman, Patrick Kennedy. He has done in the legislature here what we need more of in Congress. He's been willing to stand up to vested interests and to stand up for the people of Rhode Island. I want you to help him be elected to the Congress on Tuesday. And you're going to do it, aren't you? Now I just want to say a simple but heartfelt thank you to Jack Reed. Jack Reed was there for us on the crime bill, on the Brady bill, on the family and medical leave bill, on helping to provide more affordable, easier to repay college loans to a whole new generation of American students. Jack Reed was there, and you ought to be there for him. I also want to thank all these other fine Democrats for being here with me, your State chair, Guy DeFault, who has such a good voice he could almost speak without the microphone. Your Lieutenant Governor, Bob Weygand, Jim Langevin, Sara Quinn, and Richard James. I want you to stand with all of them on Tuesday."", ""I love Rhode Island. I love to come here. Today I was told that today I was the first President since Andrew Jackson to go to Pawtucket. And I said, that was good because Andy Jackson and I cared as much about ordinary Americans as anybody who ever had our jobs. I was then told I was the first President in anybody's memory to come to Rhode Island twice in the same year. I'd love to come here every month. I love it here. I mean, look around. This is America, the Italians, the Irish, the French, the Portuguese, the African-Americans, the Haitian-Americans, the Hispanics. You name it; you got it. America's future here in Rhode Island, people working hard."", 'My fellow Americans, 21 months ago, with the help of the voters in Rhode Island, the American people hired me to be the President on a commitment to change the direction of the country, to get the economy going again, to empower ordinary Americans to compete in this economy, to make Government work for ordinary people again and not just organized interests, to make the world a more prosperous and a safer place for Americans to live and for these children to grow up.', 'We had this slogan, ""Don\'t stop thinking about tomorrow,"" because we had always believed that. And yet we had been through years in which people only did what was easiest today, in which we had leaders who talked tough but acted soft and did not tell us the truth and did not challenge us to do what we have to do in order to get this country into the 21st century, so that these children will have a great future and so that our best days are before us. That was my commitment 21 months ago. And I have to tell you, this country still has great challenges, but we are in better shape today than we were 21 months ago.', ""We have more jobs, a lower deficit, a smaller Federal Government, less regulation. We've corrected abuses like the $500 hammers and the $50 ash trays. We are giving you a Government that gives you your money's worth. We have done things for ordinary people. The tax system is fairer; 15 million working families, including thousands and thousands in this State, got their taxes reduced because they worked full-time, they have children in the home, they're just barely above the poverty line. And we do not believe, in our administration, that people who work hard and are trying to be good family people should be pushed into poverty by the tax system. We have done more on that than anybody has in 20 years."", ""The family and medical leave law protects families so that if there is a baby born or a sick parent, you can take some time off to deal with your family problems without losing your job. That's an important thing that we have done."", ""We're going to immunize all the children in this country under the age of 2 by 1996. We are expanding Head Start. We are establishing apprenticeship programs for young people who get out of high school, who don't go on to college but do want good jobs with growing wages and a better future. And we have dramatically, and I mean dramatically, changed the college loan program so that young people can borrow money to go to college at a lower cost and better repayment terms."", 'And the world is changing. The world is changing. There is more trade but a lower threat of nuclear problems. We continue to work with the Russians. We have made an agreement with the North Koreans not to become a nuclear state. We are expanding trade and job opportunities all around the world. We are promoting peace in a peaceful but strong manner from Haiti to Northern Ireland to the Middle East to the Persian Gulf.', ""This country is moving. We are moving. And the message must be to the voters of Rhode Island and America in the next week, we are moving in the right direction. In 21 months, a good start has been made. Have 30 years of social problems been corrected? Have 20 years of economic stagnation been totally reversed? Have 12 years of trickle-down economics been totally overcome? No. But in 21 months we've made an awfully good beginning. Let's keep going."", 'I thought to myself over and over and over again, what could have possessed our opponents to come out with this contract on America? What could have possessed the opponents of Congressman Reed and Representative Kennedy to sign it? It is a trillion dollars\' worth of promises. Oh, it sounds so good. Here we are on the eve of the election, and one more time, they\'re like the Pied Piper of Hamelin. You remember what happened to the people that followed him? [Laughter] ""We\'ll give you a tax cut. We\'ll increase defense. We\'ll increase Star Wars. We\'ll balance the budget. And we\'ll tell you all about how we\'ll do it after the election.""', ""So we're telling you how they have to do it before the election, and they're all upset about it. They wish we wouldn't tell you. But when you promise people a trillion dollars and you act like it's free, it sounds like a good time. But it's not free. To keep their promises, they would have to cut everything else that you depend upon by 20 percent across the board: Social Security $2,000 a person a year, Medicare, veterans programs, programs for farmers in the Heartland of America, everything. If they say they don't want to cut Social Security, then they have to cut everything else 30 percent across the board, devastating the Medicare program of this country. It is wrong. And if it is just a cheap election year promise, it is even more wrong, because that means they are going to explode the deficit, ship our jobs overseas again, and compromise the future of these children who are here. We have to say no to this. We're doing fine. We're going forward. We're not going to turn back."", ""It was bad enough when they were just saying no. When they tried to say no to the crime bill, no to deficit reduction, no to the college loans, no to family leave, no to the Brady bill, bad enough when they killed campaign finance reform, lobby reform, environmental legislation. Shoot, this crime bill, every law enforcement group in America was for it. I've got this watch on today that I got from the Rhode Island Police Chiefs Association when I signed the crime bill. But they were against it for political reasons, because they didn't want the Democrats to be perceived as being tough on crime. Never mind what really counted was not who got credit for the crime bill but whether the murder rate was going down, whether the rape rate and the violence rate was going down, whether we were saving more kids before they become criminals, whether elderly people felt safer in their homes and kids felt safer in their schools. That's all that matters."", ""If they would work with us, everybody could have credit. There's more than enough credit to go around. You ought to be in the driver's seat in this country, not a bunch of politicians in Washington trying to cause failure to make you mad, to hope you'll do the wrong thing. And that's their program. You've got to do the right thing. You've got to turn the lights on in America. You've got to say we're going in the right direction."", 'Let me say this. You know, I ought to quit, but I\'m having a good time. I was asked the other day, and I got to thinking about it—somebody said the other day, said, ""Did any job you ever had prepare you for being President?"" And I said, well, I was a Governor a long time, but it really wasn\'t the same. For one reason, you can stay in touch with the people better. It was much more difficult for folks to get in the way of me and my constituents when I was the Governor of a small State. So I thought of all the other jobs I\'ve had. And the one that my job is most like now is one I never made a penny doing, was when I worked with civic clubs on car washes—[laughter]—because I liked to clean the windows off. That\'s what we\'ve got to do in America today. You know, if you drive your car and there\'s a lot of stuff on the windshield, you can think it\'s dark outside when the Sun\'s shining. You could think there are obstacles there when the way is clear. And then there could be a huge obstacle out there and you wouldn\'t be able to see it, and you\'d run smack-dab into it. That\'s what they\'ve done. They\'ve put a lot of dirt on America\'s windshield. We\'ve got to clean it off between now and Tuesday. Will you help? Will you do your part? Will you go forward?', ""Folks, this is an election between hope and fear, between unity and disunity but, more than anything else, between going forward and turning back. As I told the people over in Pawtucket at the Portuguese Social Club today, think about it like this: Every one of you is in the driver's seat. And on election day, just imagine that you have a remote control in your hand and what's in the movie screen or television screen is a movie about America's future. And you've got the remote control in your hand. You can push forward, you can push fast forward, or you can push reverse. Push forward, go on and push fast forward if you want to, but say no to reverse, no, we're going forward. We're doing better; we're going to do better still. We're going forward, forward, forward!"", 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"

I was told in my briefing this morning that I am the first President of the United States to visit Pawtucket since Andrew Jackson. And that's not all that inappropriate. I probably care more about average Americans than any President since Andrew Jackson."", ""I want you to know, Mr. Mayor, how delighted I am to be here in your wonderful city. I am delighted to be here in the Portuguese Social Club.

[Laughter]"", ""Twenty-one months ago, with the help of the State of Rhode Island, the people of the United States sent me to Washington to try to change the direction of this country, to get the economy going again, to empower our people to compete in a tough global economy, to get the Government to work for ordinary citizens again, to try to help make the world more peaceful and more prosperous for Americans to live and flourish in. Well, 21 months later, jobs are up; the deficit is down; we have more educational opportunities; we've taken a serious assault against crime; the tax system is fairer; we've increased trade and reduced the nuclear threat. For the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age, no Russian missiles are pointing at your children or your grandchildren. America has become recognized as the world's defender of peace and freedom and democracy. In short, we've still got a lot of problems, folks, but this country is in better shape than it was 21 months ago. And the issue is whether we're going to keep going forward."", 'Just remember the challenges we face: 30 years, 30 years of deepening social problems with more and more children being born into difficult family circumstances and more and more violence and gangs and drugs building up; 20 years in which most of our wage earners have worked harder every year without getting wages that even kept them up with inflation; 12 years of a very different economic policy, trickle-down economics, that really believed you could give tax cuts to the wealthy, increase spending, explode the deficit, and somehow stagger your way to prosperity. In the last 4 years before I became President, this State alone lost about 30,000 jobs.', ""Well, we're trying to change all that. We've tried to reward the values of work and family and strengthen our communities. Instead of making easy promises to the American people, I've tried to have disciplined commitments and challenge the American people."", ""We passed the family and medical leave law after 7 years, which guarantees 164,000 working families in Rhode Island if they have to take a little time off for a baby to be born or to take care of a sick parent, they won't lose their jobs now."", 'Thanks in no small measure to Senator Pell and to Congressman Reed, we made 20 million students and former students eligible for lower cost college loans and better repayments, including 117,000 right here in Rhode Island.', ""You heard Mr. Kennedy say that we provided a fairer tax system. We did ask 1.2 percent, the wealthiest of our people, to pay higher income taxes. We put all their money into paying down the deficit, along with $255 billion in spending cuts. But we gave 15 million working families, including 38,000 right here in Rhode Island, a tax cut because they work 40 hours a week, they have children in the home, and we don't believe people who are working fulltime and raising kids should live in poverty in this country because of the tax system."", ""We did pass the Brady bill and the crime bill. And I'm proud to say I wore here a watch I got on the day I signed the crime bill from the Rhode Island Police Chiefs Association. I wore it not only because a Rhode Island chief gave it to me but to highlight the fact that even though our Republican opponents in the Congress tried to kill the crime bill after having supported it, and alleged that it was full of wasted money, even though they sponsored a lot of the programs in it, every major law enforcement organization in the United States supported the crime bill, and we gave it to the American people to make our streets safer."", 'Now, when we did these things, our opponents in the Republican Party—and every one of them voted against the deficit reduction package; every one of them voted against middle class college loans—they said the world would come to an end; they said the economy would go to pieces; they said we were doing a terrible thing trying to pay our bills. [Laughter] They said it was just awful.', ""Well, guess what? In the last 4 years before I showed up, your economy lost 32,800 jobs. In our first 20 months, Rhode Island gained over 10,000 jobs. This deficit is $100 billion lower this year than it would have been if we'd left their budgets in place. We are giving the future back to our children and building an economy that can compete in the 21st century. It is the right thing to do."", ""Believe me, I know that we have more to do. I know there are still people who don't have work, and others who have work who are afraid they'll lose their jobs or never get a raise or lose their health care. I know there are senior citizens in this country every single month who are not quite poor enough to be on Medicaid but have a hard time getting along on Medicare and Social Security, who choose every month between food and medicine. I know that. But the question before you, my fellow Americans, is if you want to make progress, are you going to go with the folks that have moved forward on jobs, forward on bringing down the deficit, forward on making the tax system fairer, forward on expanding Head Start to our kids—forward, forward, forward at home and abroad—or are you going to go with the crowd that got a program to take us back to what got us into trouble in the 1980's? That is the choice in this election."", ""Our opponents said no to our economic program, no to deficit reduction, no to the middle class college loans. They said overwhelmingly— almost all of them said no to the crime bill, no to family leave, no to the Brady bill. They said no. I offered a health care bill that would have reduced the deficit over the next 10 years and provided for medicine, prescription medicine, supports for elderly people who aren't poor enough to be on Medicaid, and would have begun to phase in a long-term care program in addition to nursing homes so that people who wanted to live at home or in boarding homes could have some support. And they all said no."", 'Once there were 24 of them who said, ""We\'ll be for universal coverage. We at least want everybody to have health insurance."" And when the time came for the floor debate in the Senate, we had gone from 24 Republicans to zero. The more we moved toward them, the more they ran out the back door on health care. Why? Because they believed that the cynicism and the skepticism and the negative feelings of the American people would be so great that they could be irresponsible on every issue. They could say no to health care. They could say no to campaign finance reform. They could say no to lobbying reform. They could even say no to cleaning up the toxic waste dumps in this country. They could say no to it all, and they could punish us for what they didn\'t do. But you know what? You\'re smarter than that. And you\'re going to send them a message on election day.', ""Now, I watched your faces when Jack Reed and Patrick Kennedy talked to you about this Republican contract. And I can tell some of you find it hard to believe that anybody, even the most conservative Republican, would propose a plan that would cut Social Security benefits. After all, Social Security is a solemn contract. It's worked well for 60 years. The percentage of our national income going to Social Security today is almost exactly what it was 20 years ago. Social Security is not causing the Federal deficit. It's hard to believe, but it's true."", ""It's true. They have one Senate candidate saying Social Security ought to be voluntary, which means bankrupt the system. They have another saying that he wishes the retirement age were above 70, above 70. They have a House leader who once basically called for dismantling the system just a couple of years ago."", ""Now, I want you to see—this is the contract they signed. This is what they promised: They promised to give everybody a tax cut but most of it going to the wealthiest Americans; to increase defense, increase Star Wars; to balance the budget in 5 years. That costs a trillion dollars. That's real money, even in Rhode Island— [laughter]—a trillion dollars. Every one of us could have a pretty good time on a trillion dollars."", ""I wish—it's election season—I'd like to help elect this candidate for the Senate and this candidate for Governor and these fine candidates for Congress. I wish I could come here and promise to write you a trillion dollars' worth of hot checks. [Laughter] But I can't do it with a straight face; I just don't have it—I'm not shameless enough to do it. But they're better than we are at this; they can say anything. [Laughter]"", 'So they made a trillion dollars worth of promises. Now, here\'s how you keep those promises. The only way you can give a tax cut to the wealthy, increase defense, bring back Star Wars, and balance the budget in 5 years is to cut everything else in the Government 20 percent. That\'s $2,000 a Social Security recipient a year. Now, that\'s it; that is the only way you can do it. Then if you say, ""Oh, no, no, I never said I\'d touch Social Security,"" you have to cut Medicare 30 percent and everything else. You really think they\'re going to cut the Agriculture Department, the Veterans Department, all this stuff 30 percent? That\'s what they have to do. They have to shut down the rest of the Government, close Yellowstone Park.', ""Now, if they're not serious, if they just want to do what they did in the eighties—spend the money and load all the debt onto our children and grandchildren and wreck the economy— then what they will do is explode the deficit, start shipping our jobs overseas, and put this economy back in the ditch again, just when Rhode Island is beginning to come out. There are no other alternatives, not if they intend to keep the signed contract. The third alternative is, it was just a bunch of cheap political promises to con people into voting at election time."", ""So I say to you, my fellow Americans, we are better than that. We are better than that. We are moving into the 21st century. We have just been voted for the first time in 9 years by the annual review of international economists the most productive economy in the world. For the first time in 10 years, we've had 9 months of manufacturing job growth in a row. For the first time in 15 years, American automakers have sold more cars around the world than Japanese automakers. We are coming back. Let's don't mess it up now. Let's don't go back."", 'You know, it makes a difference whether you vote and for whom you vote on election day. It is important to reward people that are moving forward and to tell people that want to take you back with beguiling promises, ""We have heard this before."" The senior citizens of this country—people who have seen a great World War, people who can remember, many of you, the Depression, people who have seen our country at its best and its worst, motivated by our hopes and our courage, in the grip of our fears, hopeful, fearful—you know that we ought to do the right thing.', ""If we're moving forward on jobs, forward on bringing the deficit down, forward on giving us Government that's smaller but does more for ordinary citizens, forward in bringing peace and prosperity, increasing trade and reduced nuclear threats to the world, we ought not to go backward. Every voter in this country on Tuesday is just like somebody that has a remote control on a movie about America. They can push forward, fast forward, or reverse. Do not push reverse. You will regret it, and so will America."", ""You know, I just want to close with this, folks. I keep seeing how people are beat down and discouraged and they're so pessimistic because they hear all these bad things all the time. Let me tell you something, just look at what we've seen in the last few weeks. Look at what we've seen in the last few weeks about how other people look at us."", 'We had the President of Russia coming here to see me, a democratic country working with us on reducing the nuclear threat. We had the President of South Africa coming here to the United States to thank us for helping to conduct their free election. We have been asked to participate in helping to bring to an end the centuries-old conflict between the Catholics and the Protestants in Northern Ireland. We have been involved in restoring to Haiti the democratically elected government of President Aristide. And we were the only country in the world, by the way, that could have done that and actually had Haitian-American soldiers down there speaking Creole to the natives because America is a country for everybody. We are a country of all peoples, all ethnic groups, all backgrounds.', ""I went to see our young men and women in uniform in the Persian Gulf who so quickly turned back the tide of Saddam Hussein's recent aggressive move. I was there at the signing of the peace treaty between Jordan and Israel. Let me tell you something: Other people around the world, they are not cynical about America. They admire the strength, the values, the energy of this country, our capacity to grow. They know we have the strongest military in the world, but they also know we're the world's strongest peacemaker, the world's strongest economy, and the world's strongest example. That is what we owe to our children and our grandchildren. The best days of this country are before us, but they will not be before us if we divide the old against the young, if we walk away from our responsibilities to our children or to our parents and grandparents, and if we walk away from our responsibility to ourselves."", 'So I say to you, we\'re moving forward. You be thinking on Tuesday: ""I am in control. I have a remote control on America\'s movie. I\'m going to go into the polling place, and I\'m going to push forward; maybe I\'ll even push fast forward. But I certainly won\'t push reverse.""', 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"

I came here to ask you to vote for Carl McCall, to ask you to send Senator Moynihan back with a record margin, send them a message back, and most of all, to ask you to make Mario Cuomo the real ""comeback kid"" of New York State.', 'This election is shaping up to be one of those classic American elections that gets replayed every so often in our history: a race between hope and fear; a race between tomorrow and yesterday; a race between people who appeal to what is best in us and those who tell us that everything is just terrible and we ought to lash out; a race between those of us who challenge the American people to do better, who try to empower them to make the most of their own lives and those who offer them cheap and easy promises of a time which never was and never will be. That is what we are facing in these closing days.', ""I want to tell you something, folks. I understand why a lot of Americans are frustrated today. You know, there are a lot of people out there who haven't gotten a raise or are worried about losing their health care or think that their future is uncertain. But I'll tell you something, after 21 months this country's in better shape than it was when we took office."", ""With all of our difficulties, we know one direction, forward. We are moving forward in jobs, 4.6 million new jobs. New York lost a half a million jobs in the 4 years before I took office. New York has gained over 110,000 jobs in just 21 months. We're going forward, not backward."", ""We are going forward in doing things for working families: the family and medical leave law, tax cuts for millions of working families to keep them out of poverty if they have children and they're working 40 hours a week; immunizations for all the kids in this country under the age of 2 by 1996; more Head Start. That is forward. Let's don't go backward."", ""Our Republican friends, they always said big Government was the enemy and the deficit was terrible. But when they had power, they exploded the deficit and increased the Government. We have reduced the deficit. We have shrunk the Federal Government. We have given the money back to New York, to Albany, to Rochester, to the communities to fight crime and make our streets safer. That is the record. We're moving forward."", 'We are moving forward. The economy is coming back. The Government is working for ordinary Americans. This world is a place where there is more trade and less nuclear threat, a place where America has been a force for freedom and peace and democracy. From the Persian Gulf to the Middle East, to Haiti, to South Africa, to Northern Ireland, we are moving forward, forward, forward.', ""New York is moving forward. Mario Cuomo and I just came from a demonstration of educational technology where we saw children doing marvelous things in the classrooms of this State, interconnecting with their computers to sources all over the world. Do you know, the State of New York in the last 10 years has cut its school dropout rate by about 50 percent. That would be the envy of every State in the United States. We're moving forward. We're moving forward."", ""In education, we're moving forward. We know that people need a lifetime of learning. We're establishing apprenticeship networks all over this country for young people who don't go to college. And we're making college more affordable with lower interest loans and better repayment terms so that every young American can afford to get a college education. Forward, we're moving forward."", ""What do our adversaries do in this election? What do Governor Cuomo's adversaries do? They don't have other programs. They don't have a vision for the future. They just say things are bad. What do our adversaries do? Ask Senator Moynihan. Well, they kill things when they can. They killed health care reform. They killed campaign finance reform. They killed lobby reform. They even killed a bill to clean up the toxic waste dumps of America. Nobody was against it, but they killed it anyway because they didn't want Pat Moynihan to be able to come back to New York and run for reelection to the Senate by saying that he helped to take the poison out of the ground. So they left the poison in the ground so they could poison the political atmosphere. Tell them no thank you, we're going forward, forward, forward."", ""There are problems in this country, real things to be worried about, deeply troubling developments in our culture: the rise of crime and drugs and gangs. And we know all that. But they have been coming for 30 years. There are economic problems: stagnant wages for working people, people losing their health insurance. That has been happening for nearly 20 years. And we had 12 years of trickle-down economics. We have only had 21 months, folks, but we're in better shape. Let's keep going forward, not go backward."", 'What is the argument? The argument against this administration, this chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, this distinguished Governor is really you ought to be mad and go in and vote your anger. And what do they promise? They said, ""Give us power in the Congress, and we\'ll make you a trillion dollars\' worth of promises. All Bill Clinton does is nag you. All he does is tell you you\'ve got to get a better education, you\'ve got to be more productive, you\'ve got to be more competitive. We\'ll make you a promise: Vote for us. We\'ll cut taxes. We\'ll raise spending. We\'ll balance the budget. Presto, no pain.""', 'What does it cost? ""A trillion dollars."" How are you going to pay for it? ""We\'ll tell you after the election."" [Laughter] Unbelievable!', ""And so their promises mean, my fellow Americans, only one of two things for the people of New York. Either they will keep their promise, as Senator Moynihan has said, and they will destroy Social Security, Medicare, our ability to fund the crime bill, and other things to help New York. They will destroy the education bill I just signed which helps the cities and the local community schools to revolutionize education, by keeping their promise. Or they will abandon their promise, and they will explode the deficit, start sending jobs overseas again, and put the economy in the ditch. That is backward. No, thank you, we're going forward next Tuesday. Forward, that's the direction we know."", 'Yes, there is frustration in the electorate. But you know, the first thing you try to teach your children as a parent once they really begin to be aware of the world is not to make an important decision when you\'re mad. ""If you\'re mad, count 10 before you talk."" How many times were we raised with that? What the Republicans want you to do is go in and vote before you count to two. [Laughter]', ""Well, folks, I want to ask every one of you in this enthusiastic crowd to leave this place and promise yourself that between now and Tuesday you're going to find three or four or five of your neighbors and friends who haven't made up their mind in these races, who aren't sure how they're going to vote in the Governor's race. Tell them to take a deep breath; sit down and have a cup of coffee with them and talk about moving forward."", ""On election day, imagine that every American has in his or her home a movie of America on the television and the remote control in your hand, and you get to push the button. You can push forward; you can even push fast forward if you want to—[laughter]—or you can push reverse. No; forward, always forward. That's what this country has done. That's what this country needs. You just think about it."", ""Let me tell you, I've just come back from this wonderful trip to the Middle East. I have looked into the eyes of millions of people who are not Americans. In all those countries I visited, I saw people looking at our fine young men and women in uniform in the Persian Gulf. I saw the Jordanians and the Israelis looking at the American President—not me, they saw America. And you know what? The people outside this country are not cynical about America. They think we're the strongest military power, the strongest force for peace, the strongest force for economic progress, the strongest force for opportunity. They are not cynical. They are not cynical."", ""And if on election morning the people of New York wake up and they're not cynical and they see ourselves as others see us and they see the potential of this State and the potential of this country, they will send Mario Cuomo back to the Governor's mansion in Albany."", ""Now, you—you must be his voice. You must be the voice for these candidates who stand for what is best in us, who stand for hope over fear, who stand for tomorrow over yesterday— you, every one of you. Don't miss a chance. Don't miss a lick. Don't leave a stone unturned. Go out there now between now and Tuesday and say: Look at me, I represent America, hope, and tomorrow. Help me go forward."", 'God bless you all.']"
14,William J. Clinton ,"November 03, 1994","[""Thank you. First of all, I'd like to thank you for giving me a drier welcome than I had the last time I came to Iowa."", ""I want to thank the Dowling High School Band, thank you very much. I thank my good friend Senator Tom Harkin for that wonderful speech and for being a constant source of leadership and courage and support in the United States Senate. I don't know what I would have done without Tom Harkin in the last 2 years. And since I'm in Iowa, I also want to say that Ruth Harkin is the best Director of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and has made more American jobs in that position than anybody who ever held it before she took it."", 'I am delighted to be here with all the fine leaders of the Democratic Party and with your candidates for Congress: Glen Winekauf, Sheila McGuire, Elaine Baxter, my old friend Dave Nagle—the second time is the charm for Elaine and Dave; I know it will be—with Neal Smith, whom I admire more than I can say, and I want to say a little more about him later and about this race he is in; and with Bonnie Campbell, who ought to be the next Governor of the State of Iowa.', ""Ladies and gentlemen, this election all over America represents a choice, a choice between hope and fear, between the mainstream and the mean stream, between whether we're going to be together or we're going to be divided, between whether we're going forward or we're going to go back. I think I know the answer to that. You want to keep going forward!"", ""Twenty-one months ago, with the help of the good people of Iowa, I moved to Washington to assume the Presidency. Now, since that time, I have kept my commitment to try to put the American people first, to make the Government work for ordinary people, to bring the economy back, to empower Americans so that everybody could assume the responsibility of living up to the fullest of their capacities, to give you a world that is more peaceful and more prosperous for Americans to work in. And while I know we've still got problems, we've still got folks who are worried about their jobs and worried they won't get a raise, people who still are worried about losing their health care—yes, there are still problems."", ""But I ask you to consider this: We went to Washington to deal with 30 years of accumulated social problems, with 20 years of stagnant wages and losing benefits for working people, with 12 years of the consequences of trickledown economics, with 4 years of the slowest job growth since the Great Depression. And folks, after 21 months we've still got a good ways to go, but this country is in better shape than it was 21 months ago."", ""We've taken a stand to try to help ordinary working people. You heard Bonnie mention the family and medical leave law; let me tell you what that means in Iowa. It means that 446,000 more Iowa working people can take a little time off if there's a baby born or a sick parent, without losing their jobs. That makes a difference here in Iowa. It means that in Iowa, 358,000 people will be eligible for lower costs on their college loans because of our reform of the college loan program. It means in Iowa that 118,640 working families got income tax reductions because they're working full-time, they have children in their homes, and we don't believe that anybody who does that should be in poverty. The tax system should lift them out of poverty, not put them in. For all their attacks on us, 13 times as many people in Iowa got an income tax cut as an income tax rate increase. That is the record of our administration with our supporters in Congress moving this country forward. I think we should keep doing it."", 'It means after years of bickering delay, we passed the Brady bill and the crime bill. And I can tell you that Iowa—Iowa—is the first State in the United States where the United States Attorney has brought an action under our ""three strikes and you\'re out"" law. If you commit three serious offenses, threatening or taking the lives of others, you should not be eligible for parole. And the first action under a law I signed 2 months ago has been taken in Iowa.', ""The other guys, they always told you how bad the Federal Government was. But when they were in charge, the Government got bigger. They always told you that they hated the deficit, but they quadrupled the national debt. Since we've been in office, we have reduced the Federal deficit, we have shrunk the Federal Government, and we have taken all the savings from the reduction in Federal bureaucracy and given it to local communities in Iowa and all across the United States to fight crime, to make our streets safer, to give our kids a better future. I think it's been a good bargain."", ""When I proposed and the Congress adopted our economic program, the other fellows said the sky would fall. They said the world would come to an end if the President's economic program was passed. Well, folks, they were wrong. They were wrong. You look at the results. In this country in the last 21 months, our economy has produced 4.6 million new jobs. For the first time in a long time—and this is very important for Iowa—more than half the new jobs created in 1994 in America played above the national average in wages and income. We had more high-wage jobs this year than in the past 5 years combined. We're moving in the right direction. We don't need to turn back now."", ""I told you if you would send me to Washington, I would be a President who would remember the farmers in rural America; would remember what it's like to live in the small towns, in the country crossroads, the places that Presidents don't visit and that people don't often take notice of. Well, in 21 months, in agriculture, I think we have plainly kept our commitments. We've increased loan rates. We've reformed the Nation's crop insurance system. We've given more crop disaster assistance payments; they've been based on quality, not just quantity. We've reduced the paperwork in the farm program. We've changed the farm income reporting system to more accurately reflect the real income of the average American farmer. We brought farmers into the policymaking process at the Department of Agriculture. We've reorganized. We've reduced spending. We've taken a $3.6 billion cut in the farm bureaucracy without doing what the Republicans say they want to do, which is to gut the farm programs. This is the friend-of-the-farmer administration, and you ought to support it and keep going forward."", 'And I want to say something especially about Tom Harkin and particularly about Neal Smith. When it came to ethanol, the Republicans said one thing but did another. I\'d come out here in the middle of the farm country in Iowa and Illinois and the Dakotas, particularly in places that cared about ethanol. And people would say, ""Well, we\'re farmers. We usually vote Republican."" And I said, ""Well, if you\'ll vote for me, I won\'t just talk about ethanol. I\'ll go to Washington and try to do something about it.""', 'Well, during the last administration, they cultivated all the farmers, but they danced around the ethanol issue like a kid around a maypole. [Laughter] They\'d tippy-toe here, and then they\'d go back to Washington and they\'d tippytoe there. I couldn\'t figure out why, until I got to Washington and all the establishment in Washington tried to get me to tippy-toe, too. And I said, ""Folks, I haven\'t been here long enough to learn this Washington tippy-toe. I told them in Iowa I was for ethanol, and I\'m going to be for ethanol.""', 'I want you to understand how tough it was. Tom Harkin, Neal Smith led the fight in the Congress to approve the promotion of ethanol. The vote was close. In the United States Senate, it came down to a tie vote, and Al Gore broke the tie in favor of ethanol. We did it to make ourselves more independent of foreign oil. We did it to promote the cleanness of our environment. We did it to create new jobs for farm families. But if it had not been for Neal Smith— I want you to think about this Tuesday—if it had not been for Neal Smith, we would not have been able to do it. And he ought to be sent back to Congress to keep fighting for you.', ""We are trying to help farmers all over America. We resolved the wheat dispute with Canada. For the first time—it's a big deal where I come from—for the first time ever, we opened the Japanese market to American rice and the Chinese market to American apples. Twice this year, including yesterday, something you care about, when hog prices were at their lowest mark in decades, we approved additional sales to Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union through the Export Enhancement Program. We are helping the farmers of America."", ""Tom and Neal and a lot of other people have been talking to me about the record corn harvest. You know how it is when you're farming: You're either flooded or you're glutted. You escaped the flood. Now you've got more corn than you know what to do with. It's depressed feed grain prices by 10 to 15 percent below the average. Today I am glad to announce that we will open the Farmer Owned Reserve for 1994 feed grains. We will provide no-cost extension of the USDA loans due next July. We'll enable the farmers to store that grain, rather than sell it when prices are too low. You clap for me, but you ought to thank Tom Harkin and Neal Smith, the chief architect of the Farmer Owned Reserve."", ""When I flew over Iowa last year, when I sat down and I walked through and I saw the flooded fields and the flooded cities, it made an indelible impression on me that I will never forget. I'm proud of the work that our agencies did here last year: James Lee Witt and the Emergency Management Agency, Secretary Espy, Secretary Cisneros, all the others in our administration. Well, this year, more farmers are hurting from crop losses in Texas, in the Dakotas, in Kansas, in Georgia, all across the Southeast. Today we're authorizing further disaster payments for them, just under a billion dollars from the emergency funds we set aside. And you remember what Tom Harkin said, the only reason we can do this is because you had a Democratic President working with our friends in Congress who restored the cuts made in the disaster assistance program by the previous Republican administration."", 'And for those who say, ""Well, that\'s what the Democrats do, they just spend money""— no, no, no. It was the Democrats: We reduced the deficit; we reduced defense and domestic spending this year for the first time in 25 years. We did that. But because of discipline, because of a commitment to root out waste, because we changed our buying practices so there wouldn\'t be any more $500 hammers and $50 ashtrays, we increased our investment in disaster assistance, in Head Start, in immunizing all the kids in this country under the age of 2 by 1996, in college loans. We increased our investment in the things that count in this country. Now, what we need to do, if you really want to keep going in this direction, is to give me partners. Send these people to Congress. I need help, folks.', ""The other guys, what did they do? They voted no every chance they got. Every one of them voted against our program to revolutionize the college loan program, to provide for more affordable college loans. And it saved money. It saved the Treasury $4 billion. It saved borrowers $2 billion. They voted against it because the organized interests were against it. Every one of them voted against our economic program to reduce the debt and give 118,000 families in this State a tax cut because they were just above the poverty line, because they didn't like it that we asked one percent of our people to pay higher tax rates because they could afford it to reduce the deficit, every one of them."", ""And there are so many things that a President does, that a Congress does that have their impact in the States. You know, I had the privilege of serving my State as Governor for quite a long while. On the tough days in Washington, I think that was the best job I ever had. [Laughter] And I can tell you that so much that I hope to do for our economy still can't be felt unless you have a Governor with an economic strategy for high-wage jobs, to help small businesses, to bring economic opportunity to the rural areas and the places where it has been lost in the last 10 years. Bonnie Campbell will do that. I want you to help her get elected."", 'This crime bill we passed, it is a very important piece of legislation. It has more punishment. It has more prisons. It has more police. It also has opportunities for prevention to keep kids out of trouble. But the work of fighting crime is done at the State level; it is done at the community level. We need partners out here in the country. You have the tools now to lower the crime rate to make your children safer, to make your future safer.', 'The leadership of the other party tried to kill the crime bill, but we stopped them and we passed it. But now you need a Governor who understands what it takes to lower the rate of crime, reduce violence, and give our kids a better future. Bonnie Campbell proved as attorney general she does that, she knows that. Give her a chance to serve.', 'Now listen when I tell you what the stakes are in Congress, and why it is so important that you return Neal Smith and elect these other candidates for Congress. Last Sunday on ""Meet the Press,"" the Republicans\' top strategist in Washington, Bill Kristol, said he wanted to end farm subsidies, and as soon as the election is over, the Republican Senator from Kansas, their leader, would take the lead in doing just that. He said that; I didn\'t. Now, Mr. Kristol, you\'ve probably never heard of him, but he\'s the fellow that tells them what to think up in Washington. [Laughter]', 'He told them, for example, to stop cooperating with us on health care. I pleaded with them. I said, ""You don\'t like my ideas. I\'ll try yours. Let\'s cooperate on health care."" Another million Americans in working families lost their health insurance last year. Farmers in this State and throughout this country pay astronomical rates for their health insurance. It isn\'t right. It isn\'t fair. I had a plan so that farmers and small business people could buy health insurance at the same rates that those of us in the Federal Government and people that work for big corporations do. And they refused to cooperate because Mr. Kristol told them it was bad politics. He said—he released his memo. Folks in Washington, one thing I\'ll say about them, they\'re not humble. They\'ll tell you right what they\'re up to. [Laughter]', 'He released this memo, and the memo said, ""You folks cannot cooperate with this President on health care because if this country solves the health care problem, the middle class will go back to voting for the Democrats. So at all costs, never mind the consequences, kill health care."" That\'s what they said in the crime debate. They intimidated their Members of Congress. They said, ""Whatever you do, don\'t vote for this crime bill. Our job is not to reduce crime. Our job is to beat the Democrats."" You don\'t have to take my word for it. You remember what Congressman Grandy said. He said that he was ordered not to cooperate on health care.', 'So now they\'ve got this plan on farm subsidies, and they say, ""We\'re just practicing election-year scare tactics."" Well, you look at their contract, the contract that Neal Smith\'s opponent signed and that some of these other folks\' opponents signed and that they\'ll all be ordered to vote for, over 300 of them. Here\'s what the contract says—now, pay attention. The contract says, ""Vote for the Republicans, put us in charge in Washington, and here is what we will do: We\'ll give everybody a tax cut, but mostly people in upper income groups; they\'ll get 70 percent of it. We will increase defense; we will bring back Star Wars; and we will balance the budget."" Well, how much does that cost? ""A trillion dollars."" How are you going to pay for it? ""We\'ll tell you after the election."" [Laughter]', ""I'll tell you how you're going to pay for it. We had a study done. The House Budget Committee did a study. A trillion dollars, there's only one way to pay for it. You've got to cut everything else 20 percent across the board, Social Security, Medicare, farm programs, veterans benefits, college loans—20 percent, $2,000 a Social Security recipient a year. And boy, they squealed like a pig under a gate when we said that. If you take out Social Security, you know what you have to do? Cut everything else 30 percent across the board."", ""And if they're not serious, then what does that mean? If they're not serious, it means just what Tom Harkin said. We're going right back to where we were in the eighties. We're going to explode the deficit again. We're going to bury our kids in a mountain of debt. We're going to ship our jobs overseas, and people will be shipping out of Iowa all over again. No, thank you, we tried that. We want to go forward. We know better than that."", ""Now, I read coming in here—they always try to prepare me, and I read Congressman Smith's opponent, when Neal pointed this out that he'd signed this contract and he pointed out what the consequences were, he just went nuts and ran a television ad saying it was a lie. Well, it's not a lie. It's the truth. I know he is a plastic surgeon, but there are some things you cannot make pretty, and this contract is one of them. This contract will perform reverse plastic surgery on America. And we don't want it, and you don't want it. And you need to send Neal Smith back to Congress so he can fight it."", 'You don\'t have to take my word for it. Look what Mr. Grandy said about it. He said it\'s the crassest kind of politics. ""How may times,"" I quote, ""how many times does the elixir salesman show up with a hair tonic before people figure out this stuff doesn\'t work?"" Do not be suckered.', 'Senator Warren Rudman, the former Republican Senator from New Hampshire, very prominent in deficit-reduction efforts in the Congress before he retired, a really old-fashioned Republican who believed in working with Democrats and sticking up for what he believed in, said the other day, ""I guess you\'d have to give the Democrats the credit for reducing the deficit and managing the economy. All the Republicans were against it."" That\'s what the Republicans are saying, the mainstream, old-fashioned Republicans who are also mortified by what is going on today.', ""Folks, we've got to stand up against this. We are going forward in jobs. We are going forward in reducing the deficit. We are going forward in helping families with things like family leave and immunizations and expanded Head Start and the tax breaks for working people. We are going forward with welfare reform. We are going forward with the crime bill. We are going forward to make this world a better place. We have reduced the nuclear threat. For the first time since nuclear weapons were developed, there are no missiles pointed at the children of Iowa and the United States. And North Korea has committed itself to be checked and not to become a nuclear state."", ""And we are expanding the trade opportunities through NAFTA, through GATT, through the trip I'm about to take to the Far East after the election. We are breaking down barriers to American products and American services. We are standing up for peace and democracy from South Africa to South Korea, to the Persian Gulf, to the Middle East, to Haiti to Northern Ireland—everywhere. This country is leading a movement inside and outside the world to a more prosperous and a more peaceful level. And we are challenging the American people to make the most of their own capacities and to assume responsibility for their lives."", 'So you have a choice. Will you be for the progress that we are making, or will you go back? Will you be for the hope that we are promoting, or for the fear that they are pandering to? Will you be for what is best in us, or will you be for their easy promises and their cynicism? You know, these elections are going to be determined, in large measure, by the state of mind people are in when they go to the polls next Tuesday. We\'re out here telling people, ""This is a great country, we can do better. We are doing better. But we\'ve dealt with 30 years of social problems, 20 years of economic problems, 12 years of trickle-down economics. And in 21 months, we\'re moving things in the right direction."" [Applause] Thank you. They\'re saying, ""We\'ve still got problems. Be mad. Vote against them. Vote for us. Look at our promises.""', 'Those of us who are parents in the audience today, we know that one of the first things we have to teach our children when they get old enough to understand it is not to make important decisions when they\'re mad, isn\'t it? How many times, those of you who are like me and can still remember your childhood, just barely, did your mama or daddy say to you, ""When you\'re mad, count 10 before you say anything""? Their theory is, count one and vote no. [Laughter] That\'s what their theory is. They don\'t want you to think. They don\'t want you to feel. They want you to lash out. We have to say no, we\'re better than that.', 'I just came home from this unbelievable opportunity I had to represent you and our country in the Middle East; to witness the signing of the peace agreement between Israel and Jordan because of the role the United States played in making that peace; to see our young men and women in uniform in the deserts of Kuwait; to look into the faces of millions and millions and millions of people from six other countries who saw in me and in them the promise of America. And let me tell you something, folks, outside this country, people are not cynical about this country. They know America is a very great nation, leading the world to a better future.', ""And so I ask you, I ask you to think about that. Out here today, we're all preaching to the saved. But tomorrow there will be other voters you can talk to, you can talk to for Bonnie Campbell, you can talk to for Neal Smith, you can talk to for these other fine people running for Congress. They need you, and the stakes are high, and America needs them. We are moving forward, we have always been a country moving forward. We are taking on problems that the other guys ignored for years and years and years. And yes, sometimes it's messy, and sometimes it's hard, and challenges are not as easy to hear as easy promises. But you know this is a challenging time. And I'm telling you, the best days of this country are still before us if we take up these challenges. Stick with these people. Go forward. Vote for hope. Vote for tomorrow."", 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"
15,William J. Clinton ,"November 04, 1994","['Thank you very much. Senator Feinstein, Senator Boxer, Kathleen Brown, distinguished Members of Congress and candidates on our State Democratic ticket, to all of you who are here, thank you for making me feel, as always, so very welcome in Los Angeles and California. I want to say a special word of thanks to the gospel group, Charity, that entertained us so well. They were great. Thank you. I want to thank Marlee Matlin for her fine comments before; thank you for being here with us. Again let me say, there are very few States who could boast a slate of candidates for State office and for the Congress as outstanding as those who have already been introduced here tonight. But I just want you to know, I am proud to be here with all these nominees of my party and your party that you will elect on Tuesday. I thank them, and I thank you.', ""I want to talk tonight just for a minute about what's really at stake in this election. And I want you to think about why—I was looking at Dianne Feinstein tonight, and I was thinking, I have been following public life in America for a long time now. I never lived in Washington as an elected official until 21 months ago, but I've kind of kept up, like most of you. In my lifetime, there has never been, ever, not one time, a United States Senator who, in his or her first 2 years in office, sponsored three major legislative initiatives that will change the life of America for the better, the assault weapons ban, the zero tolerance for guns in schools, and the largest wilderness bill in the history of the United States, the California desert bill. Now, how could we not give her a 6-year renewal? We have to do it."", 'What is the argument of her opponent? It is the argument they\'re all making, really. It is that Government is inherently bad, it\'s inherently irrelevant, it doesn\'t make any difference: ""Who cares what I say or do; it doesn\'t make any difference."" You look at these children behind me and the children in this crowd; it does make a difference to their future, and Dianne Feinstein will make a difference. He said, ""What difference does it make if we pass any laws in Washington; they\'ve been up there passing laws for 200 years."" He\'s the first person ever to seek the United States Senate to run not only against Washington, he\'s now running against George Washington. [Laughter]', ""Folks, I don't know about you, but I think what Abraham Lincoln did in the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments made a pretty big difference in the life of this country. I don't know about you, but I think when we had one in four Americans out of work and President Roosevelt came in and lifted us up out of the dumps and got us going forward, it made a difference in this country. It's not a partisan thing. When President Eisenhower signed the bill for the Interstate Highway System or President Nixon signed the bill for the Environmental Protection Agency, it made a difference in this country. This guy is the only person who thinks that none of this matters. You have to say no to people who say it doesn't matter, yes to Dianne Feinstein. It does matter. California matters. She matters. Reelect her on Tuesday."", ""Look at—consider the candidacy of Kathleen Brown. I don't want to be presumptuous, but I know something about being a Governor; I used to be one. And on the tough days in Washington, I think it's the best job I ever had. [Laughter] It is a joy. But it is only a joy if every day you get up and you try to build. The Governor's office is not a place for blamers; it's a place for builders. It's a place for people who take responsibility and bring out the best in us and bring us together and move forward."", 'When I think of what you have been through in this State, with the recession, with the defense cutbacks—the unemployment rate in California when I took office was 9.4 percent. I have done everything I could do to bring it down to 7.7 percent, to get those 400,000 jobs, to get this State going again. But I need a partner here, someone who wants to work for California, not point the finger of blame.', ""You know, I want to say two things about your slogan here. The one is, I want to talk about 187. But the first thing I want to do— I've got plenty to say about that, but the first thing I want to do is to ask you this: You're going to vote on 187, and I hope to goodness you're going to beat 187. But after the election somebody is going to be Governor with 4 years of hard work to do. Will you have a job? Will your schools get better? Will your streets get safer? Will your air get cleaner? Will your State move forward? That is the question."", ""We don't know what the incumbent wants to do, but we know Kathleen Brown has a plan, a good plan, that will make California a better place, a building place. How did California become the symbol of America's future? By building, not by blaming; by bringing together, not by tearing apart. Why does California have a chance to lead our country into the 21st century? Because of our diversity, not in spite of it, because our diversity opens the world to us."", ""Now let me say this to people who disagree with us on 187. Let me say this: It is true that the State of California has borne an unfair burden in the cost of illegal immigration. That is true. And it is true that in tough times, that burden is hard to bear. But what I want to tell you is, from the day I became President, because I had served with Governors in California, in Florida, in Texas and other States, I started to do something about it. I worked with Senator Feinstein; I worked with Senator Boxer; I worked with your congressional delegation. I tried to work with your Governor. I didn't think it was a partisan issue. We have almost doubled the border guards in San Diego. We have provided funds for the first time for the cost of incarceration. When I have been reducing the Government deficit, we have increased by one-third the amount of money coming to California to deal with the cost of illegal immigration. We haven't been laying down, folks, we've been answering the call to do something about it."", ""Do we need to do more? Yes, we do. But this is not the answer. Look at 187; what does it say? It says that the adults of this country and the authorities are not able to keep illegal immigrants out of California, so we will punish their children. That's what it says. It says, close the health clinics to them, even if it creates a public health problem for everybody else. It says, turn the teachers into police officers and kick the kids out on the street. Let me ask the children here, don't you think we've got enough kids on the street already? We need more kids in school, making this State a better place."", 'Folks, the whole immigration system was a mess when I took office 21 months ago. I am trying to fix it. It is better than it was; it will get better still. Now, a lot of the people who are pointing the finger of blame at this election, who are trying to make you mad, you angry, you lash out, you vote for this, they helped to create the problem. When the Governor was a Senator, he voted for a bill to make it easier for illegal immigrants to be in California, because powerful interests wanted them to work for low wages. You know it as well as I do. And then, when he became the Governor, and a President of his party was in Washington, his friend, his ally, he never raised a peep about this to put any heat on him, and they did nothing. Then when Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer and President Clinton showed up, we did not say this about the Governor. We said nothing bad. We opened our hands. We said, ""Let\'s roll up our sleeves; let\'s take responsibility; let\'s face this problem in a way that brings California together, not drives California apart."" And that is what I have tried to do. Get me a partner in the Governor\'s office who will do the same thing.', 'Let me say again—let me say again, folks. Why are they doing well? Because they say ""If we can just make the American people""—this is nationally and in California—""if we can make people mad enough, they will vote without thinking. If we can make them cynical enough, the Democrats will stay home. And if we can make them believe that Government is bad, that it always makes things worse, then we win all the way around because when the economy gets better, we can say, well, that happened in spite of the President and the Congress. If things get better, we\'ll say Government had nothing to do with it. If it gets worse, we\'ll blame Government. And we can say any kind of outrageous thing we want to appeal to extremists and mean elements in our country, and we can still get elected."" That is their strategy.', ""Well, let me ask you something. I don't know about you, but I think it mattered when you had that earthquake and we produced $11.5 billion in record time. I think it mattered when we fixed I-5 and all the other roads in record time, something never before done in the United States of America. Do you know, today we reopened the last earthquake-damaged freeway, the Route 14 connector on I-5? I think that matters, and I think you think it matters."", 'I think it matters that 4.9 million families in California are protected by the family leave bill, so they can take a little time off when a child is born or a parent sick without losing a job. I think it matters. I think it matters when 2.1 million families in this State get an income tax cut so they can raise their children and work and not be in poverty. I think that matters.', ""After all you've been through with the cost of higher education going through the roof, I think it matters that our student loan reform makes 1.6 million Californians eligible for lower cost college loans. And when we put hundreds of millions of dollars into defense conversion and give a third of it to people out here struggling to get off of the terrible recession you've been through, that matters. When we invest in scientific research at your laboratories and create jobs, it matters. When we revitalize the shipbuilding industry in San Diego, it matters. When we do these things, it matters."", ""When we do things that build the future, it counts. That's why today we had this wonderful news that unemployment is at a 4-year low, that over 5 million new jobs have now been created. That matters. That makes a difference."", ""Folks, you have to decide what sort of future you want. I want a strong America. And what makes us strong? What makes us strong is strength abroad and strength at home. We cannot be strong abroad, even though we have the strongest military, unless we have strong families and strong education system and safe streets and good jobs. That is the strength we are bringing to America, and we need to keep right on doing it. We don't need to turn back now."", 'And this whole thing comes down to the state of mind of the people of California on election day, because if people are cynical and angry, they either won\'t vote or they will vote against their own interests. You know, as a parent, one of the first things I tried to do, like most parents, as soon as my child was old enough to understand it, was to say, ""Never, never make an important decision when you are mad. When you are mad, count to 10 before you say something."" And every time I only got to 2, I wound up in a lot of trouble. [Laughter]', 'Now that is exactly what the Republicans are trying to get you to do in this election. You look at the Wilson ads; you look at the Huffington ads; you listen to them. What they want you to do is not to take time to count to 10, not to remember that this State is the hope of America, not to remember what we can do when we\'re at our best. They want you to lash out, or they want you to give up. They want you to stay home or come out and vote for not the future but the past. That is what is going on in this election. If you say, ""No thank you, we are going forward in jobs, forward in bringing our deficit down, forward in investing in our future, forward in education, forward in building strong families,"" we will win. We will win because you will win. You will win. We\'ll win.', ""Now, I just want you to think about this. I know you think I'm beating a dead horse, but I've been all over this country and I know what I'm talking about. We will win if people think and feel their best and look at the record and look at the positions. And if that happens, Dianne Feinstein will be reelected. It is unbelievable that anybody with her record should even have a close race. You need to send her back there with an enormous, enormous ovation of support. And Kathleen Brown will be elected because she represents the future, not the past, for California."", ""Folks, I have done everything I know to do to be a good partner to the people of California. I have done everything I know to do. I have tried to take this immigration issue on. I've tried to bring this economy back. I've tried to help you with defense conversion. I've tried to help you build your high-tech base. I've tried to help you sell your products all over the world. I have tried to do things that no President has ever done. The farmers in the valley are selling California rice to Japan for the first time under this administration. And we did not do any of that by going to work in a cynical, negative frame of mind, saying that we're never going to make anything good happen."", ""My fellow Americans, your Government is neither good nor bad, inherently. It is our tool. It is a reflection of us. Whether it is good or bad, what it does, how much it costs, how well we do it is a function of what we believe and where we are going. Let's go into the future."", ""Let's don't go back. Let's don't go back. Let's don't go back."", ""Every one of you, promise yourselves you're going to ask somebody to vote for Dianne Feinstein, vote for Kathleen Brown, vote no on 187. Go see your neighbors, and turn it around. Go forward! Yes to the future!"", 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"
16,William J. Clinton ,"November 04, 1994","[""Thank you very much. Thank you, Ann. Thank you for that wonderful introduction. Thank you for that good speech. If she hadn't made a case for her candidacy before, she certainly did in those remarks. I want to thank all of you at UMD for making me so welcome, the students here. I want to thank the band for providing our music; thank you. I want to thank the children in the Kids Voting Project who are going to take their parents to the election. When my daughter was very young, I began taking her with me to vote. Now kids are taking their parents to vote. We're going to get up to 100 percent voting if that keeps going. I thank you."", ""I am honored to be here today. I'm glad to be here with Senator Wellstone. I was listening to him speak, you know, and I was thinking to myself, it's too bad Paul has no energy, no enthusiasm; you never know where he stands. If he could just loosen up a little bit, how much more—[laughter]—I'll tell you what, he's a great inspiration to all of us. He keeps everybody in a good humor and always thinking about positive things, and that's pretty tough in Washington. When all the arrows start flying and people try to be negative, Paul Wellstone will always get up in the morning and try to make something good happen for the people of Minnesota and this country."", ""I am delighted to be here with all these Democrats behind me and especially with our Democratic gubernatorial nominee, John Marty. Thank you for coming, John, thank you. I appreciate many things about the welcome I've been given by Mayor Doty, but especially I appreciate his taking me to run today. We went out and ran 3 miles around the overlook today, so I saw all of Duluth. And I appreciate that; it's a beautiful city."", ""I want to take a point of personal privilege to say that I'm glad to welcome here Ann Wynia's primary opponent, my longtime friend Tom Foley, to thank him for supporting Ann in this race and for helping us to win this race."", 'And I want to thank Congressman Jim Oberstar for so many things. He is a wonderful leader. You know—yeah, you can clap for that. [Applause] He was one of the very few Members of the United States Congress who always supported our policy of restoring democracy and President Aristide to Haiti because he understood what was at stake. And it did my heart a lot of good to hear you cheering for him a few moments ago, to think what a great country America is, that here we are in the Iron Range in northern Minnesota where people care about what happens to people as far away as Haiti. And I thank you for that.', 'Finally, let me thank you, Chancellor Ianni, and everyone here at this fine school—there you are. We appreciate your making this fine facility available for a little old-fashioned enthusiasm right before this election.', ""You know, all of you know that I came here to ask you to vote in record numbers and with great enthusiasm for Ann Wynia for the United States Senate. I want to talk to you about why, why I feel that and why I think it's so important. You all know that she's had a distinguished career in the legislature, that unlike a lot of people in politics today, she is more of a doer than a talker. We've got a lot of talkers in Washington; we need a few more doers up there. In Washington you can almost tell people between those who point their fingers and try to blame others and those who open their arms and try to assume responsibility. We've got enough blamers in Washington. We need some more people who will take responsibility for the future of this country to get it going again and face our challenges again."", ""You don't have to take my word for it or hers. You can look at the work she's done to provide health care for 35,000 children in Minnesota who did not have it or her work in welfare reform or for education, many other areas. But I want to talk to you today about what's going on in our country and what we have to do about it. Ann said that this is a choice between going forward and going back, and she's clearly right about that."", 'You know, 21 months ago I moved to Washington, with the help of the votes of the State of Minnesota, to become the President. And I set about the work of trying to change this country, trying to rebuild America, trying to bring the American people together across all the lines that had divided us, trying to make us strong.', ""What does it take to make a country strong at home and strong abroad? It takes strong families, good jobs, a good education system, safe streets. It takes a sense of security abroad and growing trade, democracy, freedom, and peace so that Americans can work in a world that is coming together, not coming apart. My friends, you know, we've got a lot of problems in this country, but the truth is we're in better shape than we were 21 months ago when our administration took office."", ""There is this vast attack today on the idea of Government, and all the surveys show that our adversaries are making gains basically because they're trying to make people cynical and negative, to convince them that Government is the cause of all of our problems, that it is inherently bad, and that it doesn't matter how outrageous they are, what ridiculous things they say, you ought to vote for them anyway because they'll bring the Government down. Now, that's the essential core of their message. They win if the American people give up hope and believe the Government is bad. Well, I'm here to tell you that the Government is neither good nor bad. It is a tool that reflects you. You control it. You're the bosses. It is yours. The question is, what should it do? How much should it cost? How should it be done? Those are the questions."", ""Now, if strong families make America strong, I happen to think that the Government did the right thing when we came in and reversed the position of the previous administration to adopt the family leave law which protects 845,000 Minnesota families. I think we did the right thing to lower the income taxes of 155,000 Minnesota families who are working full-time, have children in their homes, but are hovering just about the poverty line. No one should be driven into welfare by the tax system. It should lift people out of welfare to reward work and family. I believe when our administration asked the Congress to approve a plan to immunize all the children in this country under the age of 2 by 1996, that strengthens families. When we expanded Head Start, it strengthens families. That's what we ought to do, and it's a good thing to do."", ""I believe that we have—and all the education groups agree with us, by the way—we've done more in the last 2 years to help Americans improve education than any Federal administration has done in the last 30 years. Why? Not because people are educated by the Federal Government, not because we are dictating more but because we have changed the nature of the relationship of the National Government to the education process. And I want to mention three things, in addition to Head Start."", 'Number one, with two major education bills, we have said to our public schools, there should be national standards of excellence that our children should achieve. We believe that all children can achieve them, and we are tired of having Federal rules and regulations that segregate poor kids in separate classes and separate tracks and tell them that by the time they\'re 6 or 7 or 8 years old, ""We already know you\'re not going to make it because you come from poor backgrounds."" We reject that. We reject that; it\'s wrong. So what we have offered is higher standards but less Federal rules and regulations, fewer requirements, and more emphasis on grassroots reform, the kind of thing that has been pioneered in the State of Minnesota, where so many of the interesting reforms in public education have started in the last 10 years. We are trying to take that all across America.', ""The second thing we've done is to say that education must be a lifetime process. We need apprenticeship programs for young people who don't come to college but want to be in good jobs."", ""And we have to make it possible for every single American citizen who is willing to do so to go to college, stay in college, and pay off their college loans at an affordable rate. Already 419,000 people in the State of Minnesota are eligible for lower cost college loans or better repayment terms, and we're going to keep going until all the students in America are eligible for the changes we have made in the college loan program. No one should ever stay out of college because of the cost of a college education. No one should, no one."", ""We have given you the chance to make our streets safer by passing that crime bill. Why? Because 100,000 police may not mean much, but 10 or 20 more in Duluth could mean a lot. Because we have adopted a balanced approach, tougher punishment, more prisons where they're needed, more police to prevent crime, and prevention programs to give our young people something to say yes to as well as something to say no to in this country. That is what we are doing."", ""And most important of all, we know that the best social program is a good job. And look at what has happened. In the State of Minnesota and in the United States—we just got the latest unemployment figures today—we now know that the unemployment rate in this country is 5.8 percent, the lowest it's been in 4 years. It's much lower in Minnesota. We now know that over 5 million new jobs have come into this country in the last 21 months and that in 1994 we have had more high-wage jobs come into our economy than in the previous 5 years put together. We are moving in the right direction. We don't need to turn back on this."", ""Just in this area, look at what has happened with the Erie Mining Company coming out of the LTV bankruptcy. Look at what's happened— yeah, you can clap for that; that's good. [Applause] I heard Jim Oberstar mention the National Steel Company. You know the steel industry is booming in America today, partly because the auto industry is booming in America today. For the first time since 1979, American automobile companies will sell more autos around the world than our Japanese competitors. We are back, and we're doing well."", ""I was in Michigan the other day meeting with the autoworkers. You know what the number one complaint there is now? They're working too much overtime, and they want more people to be hired. Now, folks, that is what I would call a high-class problem. [Laughter] And we need more like that."", 'Now, this is the record: strong at home, making efforts for stronger families, better education, safer streets, good jobs. This is the record.', 'Ann Wynia\'s opponent joined the Republican chorus in unanimously voting against our economic program to reduce the deficit. They said, all of them, that if my program passed, the economy would go down and the deficit would explode. Her opponent said, and I quote, ""The Clinton budget would have ominous implications for the American economy, American jobs, and the American people."" I\'ll tell you what, he was wrong about that. And he would have ominous implications for the American economy if his ideas were adopted by the United States Congress.', ""You know, you look at what's happened here. It's the economic equivalent of something you know a lot about, a hat trick. We've got unemployment going down, jobs being created, the deficit going down to its lowest level in a very long time, $100 billion lower than predicted, 3 years of deficit reduction in a row for the first time since President Truman was in office."", ""Our Republican opponents say they are against Government and vote for them. Don't pay any attention to what they say, because they hate Government anyway; it doesn't matter what you do. [Laughter] That's what they say. But when they were in office, the Federal Government got bigger. Since we have been in office, working together, we have reduced the size of the Federal Government. We are taking it down to its smallest size since President Kennedy was in office, and we're giving all the money back to you and your local community to make the streets safer. That's what we're doing, and that's our proposal."", 'So you have a clear choice here: someone who supports policies that have made us strong, and someone who said no, no—no to deficit reduction; no to the tax cuts for the working people on modest incomes; no to the other programs, the immunizations for children; no to middle class college loan expansion—no, no, no. He even said no to the national service legislation which is giving children and young people all across America the chance to earn some money to go to college by working for a year or two in their communities at the grassroots level to solve the problems of America. How could anybody be against that?', ""Instead, they offer this contract. Now, you heard Jim Oberstar talking about the contract. I've been watching the faces of the people at our rallies when our congressional candidates talk about the Republican contract, and they go blank. They can hardly believe it. And that's really what the Republicans are hoping. They're hoping that you'll hear the sweet parts and when we tell you the bad parts you won't believe it."", 'Here\'s what they promise. They say, ""We\'re going to give big tax cuts. We\'ll give you a tax cut. Most of it will go to the top 2 percent— 70 percent of it—but we\'ll give the rest of you a buck and a half or so—[laughter]—everybody gets a tax cut. And then we\'re going to increase defense, and we\'re going to bring back Star Wars. And then we\'re going to balance the budget."" [Laughter] And how much does that cost? A trillion dollars. That\'s still real money in Duluth, isn\'t it? A trillion dollars. [Laughter] That\'s right. We could have a good time tonight on a trillion bucks. We could go all weekend long on a trillion bucks. A trillion dollars. So you say, ""How are you going to pay for this?"" They say, ""We\'ll tell you after the election.""', 'Well, let me tell you something, folks. Here are the options. If they mean what they say, that they\'re going to have these tax cuts, raise defense as much as they say, bring back Star Wars, and balance the budget, there are only the following options: Number one, they can cut everything else in Government 20 percent across the board, including Social Security, which is 2,000 bucks a Social Security recipient a year. Number two, they can say what they\'re going to say, ""Oh, how dare him; we didn\'t say we\'d cut Social Security."" They didn\'t say they wouldn\'t, either. [Laughter]', ""So, let's say they don't do that; then what do they have to do? They have to cut everything else 30 percent across the board, a 30 percent cut in Medicare for the elderly, veterans benefits, and student loans. And then there's the other possibility, which is that they're kidding; they don't mean it. [Laughter] Now, what does that mean? That's also pretty scary. What that means is, we're going to explode the deficit, ship our jobs overseas again, just like we did in the years of trickle-down economics, and put this economy right back in the ditch."", 'Now, you have the choice. When we talk about going forward, look at what is happening. We are moving forward on jobs. We are moving forward by reducing the deficit. We are moving forward in reducing the size of the Government. We are moving forward in Head Start, forward in providing immunization to our kids, forward in so many areas. We are working for stronger families, safer streets, better education, good jobs. We are moving forward. And we need to keep moving forward.', ""Let me close—I want you to think about this. We're also moving forward overseas. No Russian missiles are pointed at the children of Minnesota and the United States for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age. North Korea has agreed to be a nonnuclear state. Trade is expanding at a record rate. We are standing up for peace and freedom and democracy from Northern Ireland to South Africa, in the Persian Gulf and in the Middle East and in Haiti. We are moving in the right direction. We are getting stronger. And it's a better world for our kids to grow up in."", 'What is the real enemy in this election? Cynicism, negativism, lashing out. And I want to just finish with this. As a parent, one of the first things you learn to teach your children is what your parents taught you: Never make a decision when you\'re mad. How many times did my mother tell me when I was a child, ""Bill, count to 10 before you say anything""? And how many times did I get to 2, say something, and wind up regretting it? [Laughter] That\'s what our adversaries want you to do. They want you to count to one, go vote mad, cynical, Government\'s bad, nothing can happen, forget about the facts, forget about the record, forget about the direction of the country.', 'You, you can change what is likely to happen if they win in cynicism to what is certain to happen if we win with optimism. You, you, you can say, ""We\'re in the mainstream in Minnesota, and they want to create a mean stream for America and we reject it. We reject it."" You can say that.', 'You look at this. This institution where we are is a monument to hope. It is a monument to hope. Everybody who comes here comes here because they believe that they will have a better life, not only a better life economically but a better life personally in terms of the values, the understanding, the depth, the quality of life that will come if you live up to the fullest of your God-given potential. When you strip away all the details and all the rhetoric, that is what we are trying to do. We are trying to create an America in which every young person can look forward to living up to the fullest of their potential, in which the best days of this country are before us.', 'We need Ann Wynia in the Senate to do that. Will you send her there Tuesday? Will you help us? Will you do it? [Applause]', 'Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you.']"
17,William J. Clinton ,"November 05, 1994","[""Thank you very much. It's nice to be back in Oakland. Thank you. Thank you. Senator Boxer, thank you for your leadership in the Senate, for your energy, your enthusiasm, your passion, your friendship. California is richly blessed to have Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein in the United States Senate. Congressman Stark; Congresswoman Woolsey; Mayor Harris; a special word of thanks to my friend, the chairman of the House Arms Services Committee, your Congressman, Ron Dellums. I wish every one of you who live in Ron Dellums' district had the opportunity to travel to Washington to watch him in action, to see the way he balances the best of politics: the way he passionately sticks up for what he believes in and still runs his committee in a fair way, the way he is unfailingly decent and fair to people who disagree with him, people who are in other parties, people who are on diametrically opposed sides of the issue. That is the best of American politics. We ought to get back to it, to treating each other with respect, to building up this country."", ""Folks, before I get into my speech and give you a lot of chance to cheer again—[laughter]— I'm going to ask you to do something that normally we wouldn't do at a Democratic rally. And I want you to be very quiet and listen to me for a minute, because this is important."", 'One of the worst things that\'s going on in our country today is this incredible meanness of spirit that is being promoted among people who differ with each other. And I want us to set that aside just for a moment while I make this announcement. A few moments ago today, President Reagan announced that he was suffering from Alzheimer\'s disease. And when he said that, it touched my heart in a particular way, because I went to visit him after I was elected President and he talked to me for a long time. It was a fascinating conversation, but once in the middle of the conversation he said, ""You know, I forgot what I was talking about, and it really makes me mad."" You know, we\'ve disagreed on a lot of things over the years, all of us have, with Mr. Reagan. But he always fought with a sense of optimism and spirit. And in the days since he left the White House, I have to say that he\'s been willing to put partisanship aside to stand up for our country. He helped me on the trade agreement with Mexico. He stood up for the assault weapons ban, for the Brady bill. He and his wife stood up against Oliver North in Virginia. They were capable of putting aside partisanship. And so, having nothing to do with any of those issues, I want every one of you in this room now to give Ronald Reagan a hand and wish him well and Godspeed as he deals with this illness. [Applause]', 'Ladies and gentlemen, I come here with all these fine nominees of the Democratic Party, with my good friend Insurance Commissioner Garamendi, with Lieutenant Governor McCarthy, with so many others who are here, to ask you to think about your future. I come here on behalf of Dianne Feinstein and Kathleen Brown. I can put in a couple of sentences why I hope they will both win on Tuesday.', ""First, let me tell you about Senator Feinstein. I've been watching the scene in Washington for a long time, although I never worked there before 21 months ago. In 21 months, only 21 months, Dianne Feinstein has, as a freshman Senator, sponsored the biggest wilderness bill in American history, the California desert bill, which I signed last week; sponsored a bill that requires every school in the country getting Federal aid to have a zero tolerance for handguns, which will do more to get guns out of our schools and make our kids safe than anything else; and taken on the powerful NRA, which is trying to get revenge on every single person that had the courage to vote for the assault weapons ban. No one has done anything like that in my lifetime in that short a period of time."", ""Now, if 21 months with that kind of results doesn't get you a 6-year contract, I don't know what could commend the voters—or Dianne Feinstein. I don't know what else you could do."", 'What is the campaign against her? A hundred percent negative ads by someone who says, ""I moved to California in ‘91. I bought myself a Congress seat. Eight months later I started running for the Senate. When I ran for the Senate, I lost my own congressional district in the Republican primary, but that doesn\'t matter. I\'m just running against the other person. You don\'t have to know anything about me.""', 'Are you going to vote for somebody who produced for you or somebody who is playing to your fears? Vote for somebody who worked for you, who will work for you in the future, who cares about you; not someone who cares about the job, someone who cares about what the job can do for you.', ""And with Kathleen Brown, it's a simple choice, really, isn't it? You have a builder and a blamer. You know, very often blamers make you feel better. Sometimes when we're frustrated and we're down and we want to get angry and we want to lash out, a blamer makes us feel better. They give us somebody to be mad at. And they want you to vote mad this time, folks. They do want you to vote mad."", 'Now, as a parent, the older I get the more I realize the wisdom of my mother who raised me. As soon as your children get old enough to understand, the first thing you try to tell them is never, never make a decision when you\'re mad. How many of us were told on our mother\'s and father\'s knee, ""When you\'re mad, count to 10 before you say anything""? How many times did we find ourselves so upset we were incapable of taking our parents\' advice, and so we started talking at about 2 instead of 10? And every single time we did it, we regretted it. And if you do it this time, you will regret it. Don\'t regret it. Vote for a builder, not a blamer. Vote for Kathleen Brown. Give California a better future.', ""You know, you have a simple choice on Tuesday. If you vote your anger, your fears, your frustrations, you will be voting for a crowd that is committed to take us back to what they did before, to the trickle-down economics of the 1980's, to the neglect of our most profound problems. Or you can vote to keep going forward."", ""Sure, we've still got problems. But let me ask you this: 21 months ago, when California and the rest of this country sent me to Washington, you did with a commitment to rebuild this country, to make Government work for ordinary people, to bring the economy back, to try to make a more peaceful and prosperous world for us to live and work in and for our children to bring the 21st century in with. And even though we've still got problems, folks, this country is in better shape than it was 21 months ago. Yesterday unemployment figures came out, a 3-year low in California, a 4-year low in the United States. We're going in the right direction. Let's don't turn back now."", ""I have been dedicated to making this country strong. What makes a country strong? Strong families, strong communities, strong schools, safe streets, good jobs, a strong foreign policy that makes us more secure, more prosperous, and promotes peace and freedom. We're making progress on all fronts. We're getting stronger. Let's don't give in to our weaknesses. Let's stand up for our strengths."", ""And we are getting stronger together. In the Government and the country of my dreams, there is room for all of us. We reach across all lines. Everybody's got a seat at the table of America. This is the most diverse and still the most excellent commitment that this administration has made, more than any other. We have people from all walks of life, from all backgrounds, of all colors in the administration, moving America forward together, and we ought to keep doing it just that way."", 'You know, when I took office, we were dealing with 30 years of accumulated social problems. You know it as well as I do. We see it today in the violence, the gangs, the guns. We see it sometimes in heartbreaking pictures, like those 10-year-old boys that dropped that 5-year-old to his death at the highrise in Chicago. But they did not happen overnight. They have been building on us for 30 years.', 'We were dealing with 20 years of accumulated economic problems for ordinary Americans: the stagnation of wages, the frequent loss of jobs, the constant threat of losing your health insurance, your retirement, and other benefits. This has been building up for 20 years.', ""For 12 years, the American people attempted to address it with an entirely different theory of politics and economics. We called it trickledown for short, but the basic idea was you could increase spending in some areas, cut taxes, especially for the wealthy, sit on the sidelines, and let nature take its course. Well, it didn't work. In the last 4 years before I took office, we had the slowest job growth since the Great Depression. And we were not doing what it took to compete and win in the 21st century, to make it an American century, to guarantee the American dream for all these children that are up here in this audience today."", ""That is the fact that we face. And I took office saying, look, folks, there had been a big debate about the role of Government. I don't think Government is inherently good or bad; it is a reflection of us. The question is, what should it do, and what should we do? In my judgment, the obligation of our Government is to create opportunity, to empower people to take advantage of it, and then to insist that you, as individuals and communities, assume the responsibility to take yourselves together into the future and to live up to the fullest of your God-given capacities."", 'Now, our opponents believe—and I must say, this year our opponents in the other party represent a more extremist point of view, on the whole, than in any time in my experience. They say that Government is inherently bad, that anything it touched it makes worse. I don\'t know how they explain Social Security or Medicare; I don\'t how they explain the student loan program; I don\'t know how they explain a lot of things. But they say, ""Anything the Government does is worse. Therefore, if anything good happens while Mr. Clinton is President, it happened by accident or in spite of what he did."" And they say, ""Since we\'re not going to do anything anyway, it doesn\'t matter how outrageous our comments are, because we\'re probably kidding; we won\'t do anything.""', 'Now, in a cynical time, this has appealed because people say, ""It doesn\'t make a difference."" Well, folks, where I come from, they say if you find a turtle on a fencepost, it didn\'t get there by accident. So you tell me, you tell me if we have made America stronger for strong families. I believe it made a difference when 4.9 million Californians were protected by the family and medical leave law so they could get a little time off when a sick baby or a sick parent was there. And I think it made a difference when 2.1 million California families got income tax cuts because they were working hard with kids in the house and they had modest wages and we didn\'t want them in poverty.', 'I think it made a difference when we immunized all the kids in this country under the age of 2 by 1996—that will make a difference to the future of our families. I think it made a difference when we said people who are dealing with AIDS are part of our family and we quadrupled housing funds, we doubled research, we fully funded the Ryan White Act. I think that made a difference and made us stronger.', 'I think it made a difference when we expanded Head Start and when we changed the way we give money to the local school districts to take all these Federal rules and regulations off and said, ""We now think all kids can learn without regard to their color or their income; go ahead and teach them all and have high expectations for all of them and let them all rise up. We\'re not going to segregate them anymore and tell them they can\'t learn because they\'re poor.""', ""I think it will make a difference as we set up national systems of apprenticeships for young people who don't go to college but do want to be in good jobs. I think it will make a difference when we qualify 20 million Americans for lower cost college loans so that everybody can afford to go to college and stay there."", 'Here in the bay area, I think you know it makes a difference that our national service program is making it possible, over the next 3 years, for 100,000 young Americans to serve their country, to solve community problems, and earn the money to go to college. I think that makes a difference.', 'I think our streets will be safer because of the Brady bill and the crime bill, because of the police, the punishment, the prisons, the prevention, and the assault weapons ban. I think it will make a difference, and I think you do, too.', 'I think it makes a difference that we reduced our deficit and increased our investment in new technologies and defense conversion. I think it makes a difference that we reduced the size of the Government and gave all the money to people to fight crime in their neighorhoods. I think it makes a difference. And you know something? It did. It did. This economy has produced 5 million jobs in the last 21 months. This year, we had more high-wage jobs coming into America than in the previous 5 years combined.', ""I think it makes a difference that you had an administration that said we're not going to sit by and watch California just die because of the base closings. So we're going to give the Alameda Naval Station to the Port of Oakland so they can build it up and create jobs and go forward. And we're going to invest—we're going to make the Presidio a national park. We're going to invest in laboratories like Stanford and Livermore. We're going to create the high-wage jobs of the future. We're going to rebuild shipbuilding. We're going to keep the airline industry afloat. We're going to do things that help California and help America. We're going to sell our computers from California all over the world. That has made a difference. Don't tell me that we're not stronger and it doesn't make a difference. It does make a difference."", ""I hear them; they say it doesn't make a difference. I think it makes a difference that for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age, there are no Russian nuclear missiles pointed at these children here. That makes a difference. I think it makes a difference that North Korea says they won't be a nuclear power. I think it makes a difference that we're expanding trade to Mexico and building friendship instead of enmity. I think it makes a difference that we have democracy and freedom in Haiti again. I think it makes a difference. I think it makes a difference that our young men and women in uniform went to the Gulf with lightning speed to stand up to Saddam Hussein. And it makes a difference that the United States is involved in peace in the Middle East and in Northern Ireland and in helping South Africa to make its elections and its democracy a success. It does make a difference. They are wrong when they say the Government is inherently bad and it doesn't make a difference."", 'So what is it that they want? Well, for America, they want their contract. Their contract is— oh, listen, it sounds good. Here we are just a few days before the election; it\'s like music to your ears. It says, ""The Government is really bad, so we will give everybody a tax cut, but almost all of it will go to people in the upper 2 percent of incomes. But we\'ll give the rest of you a couple of bucks so you don\'t boo so loud. And then we will have a big increase in defense, and we will bring back Star Wars. And we will balance the budget.""', 'So we said to them when they said this was their contract, ""Well, what does this cost?"" ""A trillion dollars."" Now, folks, even in big old California, a trillion dollars is real money. [Laughter] I could take every one of you out on the town tonight for a trillion dollars and have money left over. We could have a good time on a trillion dollars. ""Well, how are you going to pay for this trillion dollars?"" we asked. They said, ""We\'ll tell you after the election."" [Laughter] That sounds familiar: ""We\'re going to raise spending, cut taxes, balance the budget; we\'ll tell you later.""', ""Now, here's the facts, folks. I've been fooling with these budgets for 2 years. I have given you 3 years of deficit reduction for the first time since Truman; I know something about these budgets. I know something about these budgets. And here's what is going to happen. If they win the Congress, here is what happens."", 'In order to keep their promises to balance the budget, cut taxes, increase spending, they have to cut everything else 20 percent across the board: Social Security, college loans, Medicare, you name it, the farmers in the valley, everybody—anybody that gets any help, 20 percent cut. That\'s $2,000 per Social Security recipient a year. And then they say, ""Well, oh, no, no, no, we didn\'t say we would cut Social Security."" They didn\'t say they wouldn\'t do it, either. Okay, if you take Social Security off, then you have to cut everything else 30 percent, a 30 percent cut in college aid, in Medicare, in everything else. It will eviscerate some of the things that keep this country going.', 'Now, there\'s always the chance that they\'re kidding. That\'s what happened last time; they were kidding. So they\'ll just give you the goodies, and they won\'t pay for it. Then what will happen? The deficit will go up; we\'ll start shipping our jobs overseas again; we\'ll put the economy in the ditch again. Tell them, ""No thank you on your contract. We want a strong America, not a weak America. We want to be strong, not weak.""', 'And in California, what is their program? Their sole program is, ""I don\'t have any program for the future; I want you to give me a contract for the next several years based on a vote you\'re going to take, so I don\'t have to do anything. I want you to vote for 187 and vote for me because I\'m for it,"" they say, ""and give me a 4-year contract. And I\'m not going to tell you what I\'m going to do. I just want you to be mad, vote for 187, and give me a paycheck for 4 years.""', ""Now, what is wrong with 187? Let me ask you to think about this. First of all, it is not wrong for you to want to reduce illegal immigration. And it is not wrong for you to say it is a national responsibility, not just a State responsibility. And Senator Boxer and Senator Feinstein and I, we tried to work with the Governor, without regard to party, to deal with this issue. We have nearly doubled the border guards in San Diego. We have nearly doubled the number of people convicted of crimes we have sent back home. We have given money for the very first time to pay for the costs of imprisonment. When we are shrinking the Federal budget, we have given a one-third increase to the State of California in the money we're giving you to deal with the costs of immigration. We should do more. But folks, we have done a lot, and the crowd before us didn't hit a lick at it. We have really tried to help."", 'Now, we need to do more, and we will. But 187 puts the cart before the horse. In fact, it puts the cart way out there so the horse can\'t find it. [Laughter] One-eighty-seven says, ""Let\'s be real mad and take it out on the kids. Let\'s don\'t let any of these kids go to the health clinic."" But they might get sick, and then they might make everybody else sick that lives around them. ""Oh, we\'ll worry about that later. We\'re mad now."" One-eighty-seven says every teacher has got to be a police officer: ""Go check all these kids, and if you find a kid who\'s in an undocumented family, just put them out on the street."" And we say, ""But we\'ve already got enough kids on the street. We need the kids on the street to come back and go to school, not the other way around."" But they say, ""No, no, no, we\'ll worry about that later. We\'re mad now. We want you to be mad now and worry about that later.""', 'So, that\'s what\'s going on. They\'ve got a contract that says, ""Here\'s a trillion dollars\' worth of promises; take this sweet thing now, worry about the details later. Here\'s this 187; be mad now, worry about the details later."" Folks, if you want to build, not blame, you\'ve got to worry about the details now. You\'ve got to care about the kids now. You\'ve got to think about the future now. Let\'s build, not blame. Let\'s do the right thing. Let\'s vote for Kathleen Brown and Dianne Feinstein and against 187. We can do it. We can do it.', 'You know, I want you to think about this. You heard what Kathleen said when she closed her speech about turning the lights on in California. This whole deal, all across America and certainly here, this whole election—these elections are so close in so many States, this whole thing will come down to the spirit that is welling up inside the voters of this country on election day. This whole thing will come down to that.', 'Do you know what an election is like? It\'s like everybody has equal power. And you might imagine that you wake up on election morning and you\'re looking at the television, and the movie on the television is the story of America. And you\'ve got this remote control in your hand. You can push ""forward,"" you can push ""fastforward,"" you can just leave it fixed, or you can push ""reverse."" What they hope is that you\'ll stay home and then a bunch of folks will push ""reverse."" What I hope is you\'ll say, ""This is my movie; I\'m pushing ‘forward.\' This is my movie; I\'m pushing ‘forward.""\'', 'My fellow Americans, this election is something that is outside the normal course of American history. In the depths of the Depression, when one in four Americans was out of work, our great President, Franklin Roosevelt, told the American people, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" These people who our opponents say—our opponents say in this election, ""Well, even though the Democrats are facing our problems and we\'re making progress, we want you to vote your fears and give us power.""', 'Look at what the Republican Presidents, the great ones in the past, said. Teddy Roosevelt said the credit belongs to the person in the arena, the person who is trying to deal with the problems of the day. These folks say in this Senate race—this says, ""Punish the people in the arena. Put me in, and I won\'t try at all."" That\'s the complaint.', 'You look at what that greatest of all Republicans, perhaps our greatest President, Abraham Lincoln, said: ""With malice toward none; with charity for all... let us move on to finish the work we are in."" These folks say, ""We\'re going to have malice toward anybody who gets in our way and tries to stop us from finishing the work we\'re in, and keep everybody in a turmoil from now til kingdom come so we can be in office."" President Lincoln said that we had to be driven by the better angels of our nature. They say, ""If we can keep people in a foul mood, we\'ll be home on election day."" President Lincoln said our Government was of, by, and for the people. They say, ""If we can just keep people mad enough, they\'ll stay away from the polls, or they\'ll vote for us. We\'ll go back to Government of, by, and for the organized interests and the favored few.""', ""Folks, that is the choice here. It is a deep and profound thing. It goes way beyond all the details. This cynicism, this negativism, this country never got anywhere on this. These kids are here today because, for more than 200 years, every time we had a pivotal choice to make, we voted for the future. Every time people tried to get us to go back, every time people tried to divide us, every time people tried to get us to vote our fears, every time people tried to get us to be angry, we said no, this is America. This is the greatest country in human history. We are one nation under God, together, going forward. You do that, and we'll be home Tuesday night."", 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"
18,William J. Clinton ,"November 06, 1994","['Thank you. You know, it is great to be back in Seattle, and it is great to be here at this spot where we had this many people in 1992. And I hope we have the same results. Governor Lowry, Senator Murray, distinguished Members of Congress and candidates for Congress, and Mayor Rice, Gary Locke, ladies and gentlemen, I am honored to be here, honored to be here on behalf of our candidates, the forces of change, and especially on behalf of Ron Sims for the United States Senate.', ""You know, a couple of years ago when you sent me to Washington, I went there to promote change in this country, to lift up the hopes of the American people. I went there to be a builder, not a blamer; to be a uniter, not a divider. I didn't much like the gridlock I had seen, and I wanted to break it."", ""We knew that the obstacles to change were great, that we had profound social problems that had been developing over 30 years, resulting in too many of our children living in an atmosphere of crime and violence, without the strong family and community support they needed. We knew we had difficult economic problems that had developed over 20 years, where too many people worked hard and were never sure they could keep their job or would ever get a raise, or were always afraid that they might lose their health insurance or their retirement. We knew that for 12 years the other party had controlled the Presidency, and for 20 of the last 24 years, and they had built an enormous apparatus for their trickle-down economics and their politics of division. And we knew that for 4 years we'd had the slowest job growth since the Great Depression."", ""Well, folks, America's still got some problems. There are still people who need work who don't have it. There are still people who deserve a raise who haven't gotten it. A million Americans, working families—working families—lost their health insurance last year. There are still some problems. But I can tell you one thing, this country is in better shape than it was 21 months ago when we began. We're in better shape because jobs are up. The deficit is down. We've got a smaller Government doing more for ordinary citizens. And this world is more secure, more peaceful, and more democratic for the American people to live and flourish in."", 'I asked you to help me become President because I wanted to see our country strong again. I had heard enough tough talk accompanied by weak action. I wanted to see real strength. What is the real strength of our country? Strong families, strong schools, good jobs, safe streets, national security meaning peace and prosperity growing around the world. On all those fronts, we are stronger today because we did not just talk tough, we did the right things to make this country move forward.', 'When our economic program was before the Congress and every single Republican voted against it, striving as hard as they could for gridlock, they all said, ""If this passes, we\'ll have recession; if this passes, the deficit will go up; if this happens, big Government will swallow us up and crush our economy."" Well, what are they going to say today? The Government is smaller; the deficit is way down; the economy is up. They were wrong. Vote for Ron Sims to help keep making it right.', 'If people in politics were judged the way people at work are judged and the way students in school are judged, every single Democrat in this congressional delegation would be elected again resoundingly on Tuesday because the people of Washington are in better shape. The unemployment rate is down, the economy is growing because of the courage of the people here on this platform and their colleagues throughout the State of Washington. You ought to elect them and send Harriet Spanel to join them.', 'You know, this is sort of an interesting election, my fellow Americans. They wanted so badly, our adversaries, to say we had failed. And then when we didn\'t fail, when the economy began to grow, when the policies began to work, when the airplane contracts and the sales of Washington apples began to be announced, they didn\'t know what to do. They wanted to say all these things that they didn\'t get to say. So what did they then do? They said, ""Well, Government is still the problem. And if anything good happened, it was in spite of that Bill Clinton in Washington and the Democrats. They didn\'t have anything to do with it."" You know, folks, where I come from we say if you\'re walking down a road and you find a turtle on a fencepost, chances are it didn\'t get there by accident. [Laughter]', ""They want you to just keep on being cynical. They want you to keep on being negative. They want you to keep on supporting gridlock, even though you don't. They have tried all over this country to bury us in a mountain of negativism, hoping that Americans will not see the Sun shining through."", ""They talk tough on crime and vote against the crime bill. They talk against the deficit, and they vote against reducing it. They talk for education, and they vote against more affordable college loans. They say they're pro-family, and then they vote against policies designed to help families, like immunizing children and lowering the taxes of low-income working people so they can raise their kids out of poverty. In short, they talk tough, but they do things that make America weaker. We make America stronger. Let's vote for strength on Tuesday."", 'You know, they say—I don\'t know how you figure it—they want you to vote for them on the promise that they will return us to the policies that got us in the fix we were in when you voted for me in the first place. They have two lines of attack. They say, ""The Democrats are the party of Government, and it\'s bad. So if anything good happens, they didn\'t have anything to do with it. But put us in, and we will implement our commitments. We will cut taxes, increase defense, bring back Star Wars, and balance the budget.""', 'And we say, well—you think about this; it\'s an issue in every one of these House races and this Senate race—they say, ""Give us power, and we will give you goodies."" And we say to them, as you might say to your child, we say, ""Well, how are you going to pay for this?"" And they say, ""We\'ll tell you after the election."" [Laughter] I say it\'s Sunday afternoon, and it\'s pretty, we\'re all dressed up; tell us right now. We want to know. Tell us right now.', ""You know, how much do their promises cost? One trillion dollars. Look at this vast sea of people. I could take every last one of you out here tonight, and we could have a good time on a trillion dollars. The problem is, it's a trillion dollars. So I'll tell you what the facts are, folks, about their promises. There are only two options: Either they're serious, or they're kidding. [Laughter]"", ""Now, if they're serious, here's what happens. To pay for a trillion dollars' worth of promises, you have to cut everything else in the Government 20 percent: $2,000 a Social Security recipient a year, 20 percent off the Medicare of the older people in this audience, 20 percent off the student loans of the kids we want to go to college, 20 percent off the Head Start when we're trying to fully fund Head Start."", 'Now, they say, ""Oh, oh, but we didn\'t say we\'d cut Social Security."" They didn\'t say they wouldn\'t. [Laughter] So we say, well, okay, let\'s take Social Security off. Then you have to cut everything else 30 percent. You can just destroy Medicare and the college loan program and the Head Start program.', 'Now, there\'s the other possibility, which is that they could be just like they were the last time they were in control: They could be kidding, they could be kidding. [Laughter] But if they\'re kidding, you know what happens? We explode the deficit; we start shipping jobs instead of Washington products overseas; we put this economy back in the same ditch it was in the last time they gave us trickle-down economics. So let us say, ""No thank you. We want a strong America. We want strong families, strong education systems, good jobs, safe streets, and a strong country. We\'re going to vote for Ron Sims and these agents of change here.""', 'Folks, when the Seattle Post-Intelligencer endorsed Ron Sims—listen to this—they praised, and I quote, ""his practical idealism, his political wisdom, his humanitarian instincts."" That\'s another way of saying he\'s a real person. Believe me, we could use a few more of them in the Congress.', ""One of the reasons that your Senator is so successful is she comes across as a real person in the Congress. Patty Murray comes across as somebody who's raised a family, understands the problems of ordinary Americans, and is determined to work with people to get things done. We have too much gridlock there, too much partisan politics there. We need a person with a head and a heart who has lived the very message he preaches. We don't need any more people who talk tough and make us weak. We need people who are strong inside, who will make us strong and take us into the future. That's why we need Ron Sims. We need to say no to the negativism in Washington and yes to Ron Sims."", 'You know, I want to ask you to think about the atmosphere that they have tried to create in this election and measure it against our greatest national leaders of both parties. Franklin Roosevelt said, when one in four Americans was out of work, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" This crowd says, ""Please vote your fears and give us power."" Right? Teddy Roosevelt, a great Republican President, said the credit belongs to the person in the arena who is trying. These people say, ""Punish the people who try; Government\'s bad."" Abraham Lincoln said, ""With malice toward none; with charity for all."" He said, ""Let us listen to the better angels of our nature.""

I want to thank your Senators, Senator Carl Levin and Senator Don Riegle—we wish you well in your retirement, and we thank you for representing Flint, Michigan, and the United States. I want to welcome the Democratic nominees for Governor and Lieutenant Governor, Howard Wolpe and Debbie Stabenow, and ask you to help them tomorrow and support them.', 'I just have to say this: The unemployment figures came out last week, and we had a 4year low in unemployment. And the Governor here always says, ""Well, the Michigan economy is getting better."" That\'s true, but did you ever notice that it didn\'t get very much better when the Republicans had the White House and the economic policy? And even though I think an enormous amount of credit goes to the automobile industry for their incredible efforts at partnership, labor and management, bringing us back to number one in automobiles in the entire world, the rest of the States are doing pretty well, too. We\'re going up or down together; that is my message.', 'I want you to help these people and especially I want you to help Bob Carr because if nothing else you know, if you look at this fine institution of higher education, if you look at this city, if you look at this State, if you think of our country, we are going up or down together. And you only have one choice who is clearly 100 percent on your side. Bob Carr is 100 percent on your side.', ""I also want to echo what Hillary said about Congressman Dale Kildee. I want to say a special word of thanks to him for his leadership in the most productive congressional session for education in 30 years. We expanded Head Start. We changed the Federal law on aid to our public schools so that we will emphasize grassroots reform and get rid of this ridiculous assumption that just because kids are poor, from disadvantaged backgrounds, they can't learn—from now on, the same expectations, the same opportunity, the same achievement for children without regard to their background. And you heard him talking about the School-to-Work Opportunity Act I signed. That's a bill for young people who don't go on to college but don't want to be in dead-end jobs, who want good training and are willing to engage in a lifetime of learning. And I did sign that bill on a desk built by the students at the manufacturing technology project right here in Flint, Michigan, who will benefit from that sort of effort."", ""I also want to thank Congressman Jim Barcia and our candidate, Bob Mitchell, for being here. Send them back to Washington so we'll have partners for progress."", ""You know, folks, this has really turned out to be an amazing election in ways that are both wonderful and troubling. The American people know that there are still things that need fixing in Washington, and they know there are things that need fixing back here at home. They know that, in spite of the fact that we've got an enormous amount of job growth—over 5 million jobs in the last 21 months—in spite of the fact that we've got more high-wage jobs coming back into America this year than in the previous 5 years combined, in spite of the fact that the biggest problem in the auto industry is not no time, it's now overtime—a high-class problem—they know that there are still a lot of people who are worried about losing their jobs; a lot of people who are afraid they'll never get a raise; a lot of people who are worried about losing their health insurance, as one million people in working families did last year; a lot of people who still want work in some of our cities and isolated rural areas who don't have jobs. This country has problems. They know that we've still got too much crime and violence and too much disintegration of our families and our communities that make people feel personally insecure or at least violate their sense of values. That's all true."", 'Now the question is, what are we going to do about it? And what these guys say is, our opponents, they say, ""Be mad about it, be frustrated about it, be cynical about it, and put us in because we are going to play on your fears, your frustrations, and your cynicism."" That\'s their argument; their argument is, ""Look, nothing good has happened, and if you find something good that happened, it did not happen because the President was there. It did not happen because he had partners in the Congress. It happened in spite of that. It was irrelevant to that."" That\'s their argument; you listen to them.', ""Well, you know what, folks? Where I come from, people say if you find a turtle on the fencepost, it did not get there by accident. And so I say to you, don't let a frustrated electorate wind up voting for what you're against and against what you're for. That's what they want."", 'Look what they say they\'re for. They say they are for a new plan that will give a huge tax cut to the wealthy, that will bring back big increases in defense and revive Star Wars and will balance the budget. Does that sound familiar to you? They say, ""Ignore what happened in the last 21 months; it doesn\'t matter. Ignore the jobs, the growth, the help for ordinary working Americans, the fact that the world is growing more prosperous and more peaceful. Ignore all that; take our new set of promises.""', 'Now, I want you to think about this. There are really only two possibilities with these Republican promises: they\'re either serious, or they\'re kidding. Now listen to me. If they\'re serious, they have made you a trillion dollars\' worth of promises: ""We\'re going to cut taxes on the wealthy, bring back defense and Star Wars, and balance the budget."" What does it cost? ""A trillion dollars."" When you ask them, ""How will you pay for it?"" they say, ""We\'ll tell you after the election.""', 'Do you know why? Because the only way to pay for it is to cut everything else in the budget 20 percent across the board: $2,000 a person in Social Security, cut Medicare 20 percent, cut the student loans 20 percent, cut the AIDS prevention 20 percent, cut the Head Start 20 percent. That is their program. Then they say, ""Well, we didn\'t say we would cut Social Security."" They didn\'t say they wouldn\'t. But if you take out Social Security, then our opponents in the Senate and the House have committed to a set of promises that mean 30 percent cuts across the board in all those things.', 'Of course, there\'s always the chance that they didn\'t mean it, they\'re kidding. If they\'re kidding, what does it mean? ""We will give you the goodies without the price."" And what does that mean? We\'re going to explode the deficit. We\'re going to ship our jobs overseas. We\'re going to put our economy back in the same mess that this same crowd, with these same policies, put it in in the trickle-down economics years of the 1980\'s.', 'Tell them no. We want Bob Carr. We want Dale Kildee. We want Jim Barcia. We want Bob Mitchell. Those are the people we want. Tell them no. Tell them no.', 'You know, folks, one of the most amazing things to me is this effort that they are making to take a frustrated electorate and say, ""It does not matter what we say. It does not matter what we do. Anything the Government does is either irrelevant or makes it worse."" Can you imagine, can you imagine entering into any other human endeavor with that attitude? Can you imagine going to school with that attitude? Can you imagine building a business with that attitude? Can you imagine going to work with that attitude? Can you imagine building a house with that attitude? Can you imagine building a family with that attitude? No! Well, why would we want to build a Congress with that attitude?', ""You know, folks, I don't know about you, but when I showed up in Washington I wanted to rebuild the American dream; I wanted to bring this country together; I wanted to make America strong. I don't mean I wanted to talk strong; I wanted to be strong. And to be strong you need stronger families, better schools, safer streets, more jobs, a safer and more prosperous world."", ""Well, I don't know about you, but I believe it made a difference when we gave 1 1/2 million Michigan families the protection of the Family and Medical Leave Act so they could take a little time off from work and keep their jobs. And I believe it made a difference when almost 400,000 Michigan families that work full-time with kids in the house and are hovering above the poverty line got an income tax cut under our administration, so you could succeed at work and at home, being a parent and a worker. I think it made a difference. I think it made a difference when we made almost 600,000 people in Michigan eligible for lower cost and better repayment college loans, so more people could go to college and no one need ever turn away. I think that makes a difference. And I think it made a difference when we lowered the deficit and increased our investment in our future and got this economy going again. And that's why the unemployment rate in America is at a 4 year low and it's dropped 2 percent in Michigan in the last 21 months. I think that matters, and I think you think it matters."", 'So I think it matters that for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age, there are no Russian missiles pointing at these children here. I think it matters that North Korea has agreed not to become a nuclear power. I think it matters that the United States is expanding trade and opportunity for high-wage jobs. I think it matters that we are making peace and helping peace come about and standing up for freedom from the Persian Gulf to Northern Ireland, to Haiti, to the Middle East. I think that matters. I think that matters. And so I ask you, my fellow Americans, why would we want to go back?', ""This election is, more than anything else, an election about the state of mind of our voters. If people are thinking about the issues and what's in their issues and who's on their side and what's best for our future, they will have to vote for Bob Carr over his opponent. Their great hope is that everybody wakes up tomorrow mad, the Democrats stay home, the extremists go vote—the people who want a bunch of easy promises, the people who want a lot of tough talk that will lead not to strength but to weakness for most of us—that that will prevail. My great belief is that tomorrow, whatever the weather, you're going to wake up with the Sun shining in your mind, seeing clearly, thinking about tomorrow, thinking about tomorrow."", ""Folks, you just think about this. You think about what really counts when you go to work, when you build a business, when you get an education, when you rear a family. It is a positive, building, unifying, compassionate idea of what you are as a person and what you can become. That is what we represent. We've still got a lot of problems in this country, folks, but this country is in better shape than it was 21 months ago. We are stronger than we were 21 months ago. We are moving forward."", ""Don't turn back; go forward. Elect Bob Carr and Dale Kildee and Jim Barcia and Bob Mitchell and Howard Wolpe and Debbie Stabenow. Help these people. Lift Michigan; go forward. Come on, we can do it. Thank you, and God bless you all.""]"
20,William J. Clinton ,"November 07, 1994","['Thank you very much. Thank you, Charlie Oberly. Thank you, Mayor Sills. It is great to be back in Wilmington again. I thank Carrie DeSantis and all the other Democratic candidates who are here with us.', ""I thank Governor Carper for his longtime friendship and his stirring defense of our record. I was thinking to myself, if I could clone Tom Carper and have that speech given in every country crossroads in America, the political future of our administration and our party would be secure. Didn't he do a fine job?"", 'And Hillary and I both feel a special indebtedness for the friendship and the leadership of Joe Biden, without whom there would have been no crime bill this year and because of whom lives will be saved and children will grow up safer and this country will be a less violent place in the years ahead. We are in his great and abiding debt.', ""You know, the last time I did a rally here a couple of years ago, I had just about lost my voice. Well, I've been a little hoarse, and some things don't change, but I kind of got pumped up tonight, and my voice is coming back, and I want your voice to be heard tomorrow."", 'You know, the last time I came to Delaware, my first trip as President, I met with students from Sussex County who were training to enter the aerospace industry. They were working people, good young people from all different kinds of backgrounds who just wanted to get a good education so that they could compete and do well, so that they could earn a decent living, have some security, have a good marriage, raise children, and make a good life here in this wonderful State. The struggles that they faced, the opportunities that they have, the changes we all have to make—those young people from Sussex County, they are the symbol of why we do not need to turn back tomorrow, why we need to go forward, and why we need Charlie Oberly in the United States Senate.', 'You know, I ran for President from another small State that raises a lot of chickens—[laughter]—because I did not want my daughter or our children to grow up to be the first generation of Americans to do worse than their parents. I did not want our country to come apart by race, by region, by income when if we will just celebrate our diversity and learn to live and work together, there is nothing we cannot do as a nation.', ""And we have been hard at work at that. Now all the pundits tell us that the voters are still hungry for change. Well, we do need some changes, all right, but those changes won't come overnight. The problems of crime and violence, of family and community breakdown, of guns and gangs and drugs—those things didn't come up overnight. They've been building for 30 years. The economic problems of increasing insecurity of our working people, people working harder and not getting a raise, worried about losing their health insurance or their retirement, having to change jobs so many times—those things didn't come up overnight. They've been developing for 20 years. And 21 months ago when I took office, we'd had 12 years of trickledown economics which was culminated by 4 years of the slowest job growth since the Great Depression. Folks, we hadn't been there long, but this country is in better shape than it was 21 months ago."", ""Yes, there are things we have to do. Another million Americans in working families lost their health insurance last year. I don't believe we're the only big country in the world that can't figure out how to keep people with their health insurance, give people in small businesses and self-employed people the same prices as people in big business and Government get. I don't believe we can't afford to figure out how to give it to our kids, and I don't think that we have to tolerate a situation where elderly people on Medicare choose every week between their medicine and their meals. I believe we can do better. I know we have changes to make."", ""I know there is still work to be done on welfare reform. Tom Carper and I have been working on it for 7 years now. I know we still need to pass political reform, campaign finance reform. There's a Senate race in California where the Republican challenger moved to the State 3 years ago, bought a congressional seat, stayed 8 months, declared for the Senate, ran, lost in his own district in his own primary, and is still in the race because he spent $30 million of his own money. We sure do need that."", 'We need lobby reform, and we need a law out of Congress that requires the Congress and the Federal Government to live under the same laws we impose on people in the private sector. We need a lot of things to change in this country.', 'The question is, how do you get that change? Tonight, folks, I want to make the case for Charlie Oberly by asking you and asking the American people in this last speech to look at what the record of the two parties has been in the last 2 years, and what the program of our parties for the years ahead is. That is how you tell how you get the change you want, not by being mad.', ""One of the reasons that I like Delaware is that I think you folks are a little more immune than sometimes people in bigger places are to all this negative, cynical, destructive stuff that they keep trying to put on us to take our citizenship and our good sense away from us. The kind of Democrats you elect here don't believe that Government can solve all the problems, but they don't think Government can sit on the sideline either."", 'Our Government is not inherently bad or inherently good. It is what we make of it. And what I think the people of Delaware want is a Government that creates opportunity so we can say, ""Okay, the opportunity is there. Now you have the power to assume the responsibility to make the most of your own lives and your community."" That\'s what I think the people want out of Government in this country and in this State.', ""I want a strong America. But very often, what politicians give us is strong talk and weak action. What makes a strong America? Strong families; better education; safer streets; more jobs; a more peaceful, more prosperous world. That's real strength, folks, not all that tough talk, not all those negative ads. That's real strength, something you can build a life on, raise a child on, and be proud in your old age of. That is the kind of America that I want to build."", 'Now, that\'s what we\'ve been working for. What have they done? Our opponents have fought us every step of the way. They have had a simple, clear, unwavering strategy, and give them credit, folks, they stick to it. They don\'t even get embarrassed when you catch them at it. [Laughter] Their whole deal is, ""Fight them every step of the way. Do everything you can to derail them. And if they win anyway, then deny that it makes any difference."" [Laughter] Say if anything, their theory is, kill it if you can, and if you can\'t kill it and something good happens, say, ""It happened in spite of the Democrats; it happened in spite of the President. They didn\'t have anything to do with it."" And they\'re good at it. They\'re good at it.', 'Well, I have this to say to the Republicans. The same kind of people that say don\'t count your chickens before they hatch will understand the saying that is pretty prominent where I come from. They say, if you\'re walking down a road and you see a turtle on a fencepost, the chances are it didn\'t get there by accident. [Laughter] You know, they say, ""Well, these things don\'t make any difference,"" or they try to kill them. Well, let me ask you this—you heard what Tom Carper said—I think it makes a difference that 147,000 families right here in Delaware are protected by the family leave law, so they can take a little time off if there\'s a baby born or a sick parent without losing their jobs. I believe it makes a difference that 36,000 working families in the State of Delaware, working full-time, barely hovering above the poverty line, got an income tax cut under this administration, so they can succeed as parents and workers.', ""I think it makes a difference that we've increased child support enforcement, that we're pushing for welfare reform, that we've given 20 States the permission to slash through rules and regulations to figure out how to move folks from welfare to work in dignity that enables them to support their children and be self-respecting citizens."", 'I think it makes a difference that in Delaware 41,700 people are eligible for lower cost, better repayment, more affordable college loans, so that everybody can afford to go to college in this country and not drop out. I think that makes a difference.', 'I think it makes a difference that we expanded Head Start, that we support apprenticeship programs. I think it makes a difference that the job growth rate in Delaware is now— listen to this—14 times as fast as it was before this administration took office. I think that makes a difference.', ""I think it makes a difference that the crime bill passed and that Delaware will get 650 more police officers to walk the streets and prevent crime and be a good role model for our children—I think that matters—that we're going to have funds for drug education and drug courts and boot camps and things that give our kids a chance to avoid spending their lives in prison and give them a chance to spend their lives at work and in school. I think it makes a difference."", 'What I want you to know is—I\'ll say it again—Charlie Oberly mobilized the attorneys general; Joe Biden saved the crime bill in its darkest hour. Do not take my word for it; you ask Joe Biden. When you think about this tomorrow—[laughter]—no, no, not this. Listen to me. When we were in our darkest hour, we couldn\'t figure out what is going on: Why did the Republicans, when they all voted for the crime bill the first time it came up, why were they all being pressured to vote against the crime bill? They said, ""Oh, it had so much money in it."" On an annual basis it had slightly less money in it than it did the first time they voted for it. They said, ""These prevention programs are no good."" We found that a whole bunch of them had been sponsored by Republicans. You\'ve got to give them credit. They have no shame. They\'re not embarrassed about this. [Laughter] They\'re not—I\'ll tell you what, you ask Senator Biden. It\'s because their leader told them that their job was not to lower the rate of crime, their job was to defeat the Democrats, never mind the rate of crime.', 'Joe Biden said, ""No, thank you, I\'d rather have America safe. I\'m interested in the children, not in the politics of this."" And I thank, I thank Charlie Oberly and Joe Biden for what they did on the crime bill. I also want to say about Charlie Butler—don\'t you forget this— he\'s running to be the top law enforcement officer in your State against someone who opposed the crime bill. Vote for somebody who wants to keep you safe. Vote for Charlie Butler.', ""Let me say this: I think it makes a difference that we have a more peaceful and prosperous world, that there's more trade, that there are no Russian missiles pointed at these children for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age, that we are a force for peace and freedom in the Persian Gulf, in the Middle East, in Northern Ireland, in Haiti. I think that makes a difference. It makes us all better and stronger."", 'So don\'t let them say it doesn\'t make a difference what we have done. If it had been up to them, as a group, if they were in charge— and that\'s what they\'re asking you tomorrow— they say, ""Every vote for every Republican Senator, every vote for every Republican Congressman is a vote to put us in charge, to put Mr. Dole and Mr. Gingrich in charge."" Let me tell you something, folks, if they had been in charge—listen now—if they had been in charge, no family leave law, no Brady bill, no crime bill, no deficit reduction, no middle class college loans, no tax cuts for working people, no economic recovery. I think that\'s one issue we can say no to, thank you very much, no.', ""It kind of tickles me. We're giving them 3 years of deficit reduction for the first time since Truman. When we get done, we'll have the smallest Federal Government since Kennedy. We've got the toughest crime bill in history and an economic recovery. A self-respecting mainstream Republican would support that. But they have no shame. Let's take credit for it for them and take care of it for them and keep this country going forward."", 'Now, so people say, ""Well, that\'s okay, but I still don\'t feel so good."" So look at the future. I told you what our future is. Our future is, implement the crime bill, keep the recovery going, keep a steady hand on the spending, implement welfare reform, go back until we solve the health care problem, implement political reform and environmental legislation.', 'What is their future? Their future is, ""I got a promise to make you. I got a contract to make with you. We\'re going to cut taxes, especially for the wealthiest 2 percent. We\'re going to increase spending on defense and Star Wars, and we\'re going to balance the budget."" Well, how much does it cost? ""A trillion dollars."" And how are you going to pay for it? ""We\'ll tell you after the election."" [Laughter] Oh, they have no shame. [Laughter] ""We\'ll tell you after""—so I will tell you how they have to pay for it. We\'ve made a study of it. Since we reduced the deficit and they didn\'t, we know something about that.', 'Here\'s how you have to pay for it. There are only two possibilities, folks, with this promise of theirs: Either they mean it, or they\'re kidding. Now, if they mean it, they have to cut everything in this Government 20 percent: $2,000 a year in Social Security, 20 percent on Medicare, 20 percent on Head Start, 20 percent on college loans. If they say, ""Well, we never said we\'d cut Social Security,"" we say, ""Well, you never said you wouldn\'t."" But let\'s say they don\'t. Then they have to cut everything 30 percent: Medicare, college loans, Head Start, break the Government down, break the support of the middle class down.', ""Then there's always the chance that they were kidding. That's what they did to us in the eighties. They gave us the goodies and didn't pay the bill. What does that mean? Explode the deficit, send our jobs overseas, and put this economy in the ditch. We tried it that way. We've been there. No, thank you. We'll go forward, we don't want to go back. We don't want to go back."", 'My fellow Americans, our children deserve better than that. They deserve vigorous, cooperative, positive leadership. They do not deserve to be caught up in this whirlwind of negative, cynical stuff. Our kids deserve better.', 'And let me ask you this: All the papers and the pundits say, ""Well, people are so mad they\'re just going to vote against who\'s in, and they\'re going to vote against the Democrats because the Democrats have both Houses of the Congress, even though the Republicans through the filibuster have frustrated most of the progress. They\'re just going to vote no because they\'re mad.""', 'You know, we ought to be ashamed of ourselves if we just vote no because we\'re mad. Those of us who are parents know that the first thing we try to teach our kids, as quick as they\'re old enough to understand it, is what we\'ve been taught by our parents: Never make a decision when you\'re mad. Count to 10. How many times did my mama say, ""Count to 10""? And how many times did I get to 2 or 3 and say it anyway and live to regret it? [Laughter] That\'s what will happen to America unless we wake up with the sunshine and a clear head and vote for Charlie Oberly and vote for progress in this country, and vote to keep going forward.', 'Listen to what these folks say. They say we\'ve got people out there running saying, ""We promise to do nothing except give you the goodies. And everything about Government is bad, but we want to go draw a Government check for 6 years."" That\'s what they\'re saying. You would not hire somebody to build a house, do a job, start a business, you certainly wouldn\'t make a marriage with somebody that had that kind of attitude. But they want you to send a whole boatload of folks to Congress on that kind of negativism. Tell them no. Tell them no.', 'You know, we ought to keep going forward. We shouldn\'t give in to our fears. Franklin Roosevelt said, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" They say, ""Vote your fears."" Look at the Republican Presidents you all admire: Teddy Roosevelt, ""The credit belongs to the person who is in the arena who is trying."" They say, ""Punish the people who\'ve tried, and give it to us. We just pointed the finger of blame; we wouldn\'t take any responsibility for anything. We made you mad because we gummed up the works. Now reward us because you\'re mad."" Teddy Roosevelt must be shaking his head in shame at them tonight.', 'What about their greatest Republican President, Abraham Lincoln. He said, ""With malice toward none,"" not how much malice can you stir up in the electorate to turn people off. He said, ""with charity for all,"" not how much meanness and division can you stir up to keep some folks home and other folks mad. He said we should govern by ""the better angels of our nature,"" not the lowest common denominator of our darkest fear. That\'s what he said.', 'Folks, tomorrow, this election is going to be decided throughout this country by whether people wake up and act in the voting booth the way they want to act as parents, as workers, as business people, in their clubs, in their churches, in every other area of their lives. We know it is wrong to be negative, it is right to be positive; it is wrong to blame, it is right to build; it is wrong to be guided by fear, it is right to be animated by hope. We know we ought to be fighting for the future.', 'If the American people wake up in that frame of mind tomorrow, you will send Charlie Oberly to the Senate in Delaware; we will keep moving toward the future throughout this country. We will do it for our children because it is right. You can do it here. We need you.', 'Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you.']"

Out of my own past I feel compelled to say someone ought to thank the band for being here to play with us today. Thank you for dressing up. Thank you, Senator Wellstone. Poor Senator Wellstone has no energy, no conviction. [Laughter] He's a walking fireplug for Minnesota. There are many public officials here. I don't want to introduce them all, but I would be remiss if I did not thank Congressman Martin Sabo, Congressman Bruce Vento, and the distinguished retiring Congressman from Minnesota, someone who knows the difference between talk and action on the deficit, the economy, and a lot of other things, Congressman Tim Penny. Thank you all for being here."", ""Most of what needs to be said about this race has already been said here today. But I want you to focus on what you could do between now and tomorrow to talk to other people—there's a high rate of undecided in all these surveys—to make sure that Ann Wynia wins. And I have given a great deal of thought to this. This really is a contest between whether we will continue going into a future that is full of opportunity and challenge or go back to the easy answers of the past. It really is, as the First Lady said, a contest between the doers and the talkers, or the builders and the blamers."", ""You know, for all of our problems—and we do have profound problems, 30 years of accumulated social problems, 20 years of basically stagnant wages and working people being at greater and greater risk of losing their health care or not getting a raise or having to change jobs— for all of these problems, we had 12 years of their side's approach. They had 12 whole years of trickle-down economics. We've had 21 months, and this country is in better shape than it was 21 months ago. Jobs are up. The deficit is down. The Federal Government is smaller, but it's providing more opportunity for working families, for education, for family leave and in so many other ways. The country is getting stronger. I want America to be strong. What makes a country strong? Strong families, strong education systems, safe streets, good jobs, a strong foreign policy that promotes peace and prosperity for Americans in the world. On all these counts, this country is in better shape than it was 21 months ago."", ""Just last week we got the news that we had now over 5 million new jobs coming into this economy. The Minnesota unemployment rate has dropped about 1 1/2 percent. We're at a 4year low in unemployment in the United States as a whole. For the first time in 15 years, American auto companies are number one in the world in all of their sales. For the first time in 9 years, we've been voted again, finally, after 9 years, the most productive economy in the world. Why would we want to give the Congress to people who want to take us back to what almost wrecked us in the 1980's? Say no to them; say yes to our people."", 'There is always a little lag time between things that you do being done and things that you do being felt by voters. I understand that. And there are real frustrations and anxieties that the American people feel about their future that go way beyond normal politics. But what is the argument of our opponents, of Ann Wynia\'s opponent, of the Republican majority leader? They had a very clever strategy from the beginning; they have pursued it with a vengeance. Their strategy was, ""The electorate is frustrated about the mess in Washington; let\'s keep them frustrated."" Their strategy was, ""Let\'s stop whatever we can. We can kill health care reform, lobby reform, campaign finance reform, important environmental legislation. And when we can\'t stop something, let\'s at least deny that it happened or deny that it did any good."" So they say, ""If anything good happened in the last 21 months, it was either in spite of or irrelevant to the work the rest of us did in Washington.""', ""Well, you know folks, where I come from, we say, if you're walking down a road and you find a turtle on a fencepost, chances are it didn't get there by accident. Now, you think about that. [Laughter] Here is what—when we were voting last year and Tim Penny was working his heart out last year on a plan to reduce the Federal deficit after the debt had exploded, had quadrupled in the 1980's, threatening the future of our children, taking up all the money that needed to be invested in the private sector to create jobs, keeping interest rates high even in a recession, and the future of the country was on the line, the two people who are on the other side of town speaking today, here's what they said. The minority leader, Mr. Dole from Kansas, said, this is not real deficit reduction. And Ann Wynia's opponent said that this economic plan has ominous implications for the American economy and the American jobs. That's what they said."", 'Now they want to hold us accountable for all the messes that we inherited from them. At least we can hold them accountable for the decisions they\'ve taken in the last 21 months. They were wrong. They were wrong on the deficit; they were wrong on the economy; they were wrong on the future of this country. Surely, even in this age of 30-second ads and negative sound bites and lobbing verbal bombs across the wall, surely someone, somewhere today will ask them, ""Weren\'t you wrong about the deficit? Weren\'t you wrong about the economy? Why should we give you our future? You were wrong; all you did was try to stop progress for the last 21 months, and you were wrong."" Somebody ought to say that to them and say, let\'s keep going forward.', ""They say the American people are so cynical, it is irrelevant what I do anymore, because everything the Government does makes no difference to you and can't make your life better. Well, I don't know about you, but I think it makes a difference that 845,000 families in Minnesota are now protected by the family leave law so they can be good workers and good parents when their children are sick or born. And I think it made a difference that 155,000 families in Minnesota had their income tax rates cut because they worked for modest wages. And we don't think people who work full-time and raise children should be in poverty, we think they should be rewarded for what they do."", ""I think it's making a difference that we're going to immunize all the kids in this country under the age of 2, so we'll have more little kids that look like these do in the future, without regard to their race, their income, or where they live. I think that matters. I think it matters that we're making 20 million Americans, including over 400,000 people right here in Minnesota, eligible for lower cost, more affordable college loans, so that every person in the country who wants to go to college can go."", ""Now someone ought to say today, if you have a clear choice between someone who supports those policies and someone who opposes those policies, shouldn't we vote for the person who is for building the ability of the people of Minnesota to compete and win, to make the most of their God-given abilities? I think the answer is yes."", 'Make no mistake about it, my fellow Americans, what they say is, ""There is gridlock in Washington, you\'re frustrated with Washington; give us control."" Well, if they had had control, there would have been no family leave law, no student loan reform, no immunization of all the kids under 2, no expansion of Head Start, no deficit reduction, no economic expansion. That is what they would have done if they had been in control. Look at how they voted: no Brady bill, no crime bill. That is how they voted.', 'So I say, think, folks. Look at the record. Hold them as accountable as they seek to hold us. I would gladly take a simple even standard: Hold me accountable, hold them accountable for what we said and what we did. If that happens, Ann Wynia is going to the United States Senate tomorrow.', 'You know, one of their greatest Presidents was Theodore Roosevelt. He was a great fellow. I would have been sorely tempted to vote for him if I\'d been around. [Laughter] And one of the things I liked about Roosevelt was Teddy Roosevelt said the credit belonged to the person who is in the arena who is trying. These folks say, ""Punish the people who have tried and reward the people who sit on the sidelines and whine and bellyache and complain and point the finger and run for cover every time it\'s time to take responsibility for the future."" Vote for the party of Teddy Roosevelt; that\'s now us and Ann Wynia. That\'s right.', 'Their greatest President was Abraham Lincoln. He is all of our President. Do you hear his words in their campaigns? Remember what Abraham Lincoln said? ""With malice toward none."" Can you imagine him saying that today? ""With charity for all,... let us press on in the work we are in,"" driven by ""the better angels of our nature,"" because this is a ""Government of, by, and for the people."" They do not use those words. They seek to use malice and cynicism, our least charitable impulses, the lowest common denominator. That is not the Minnesota way.', ""I got really tickled—it would be laughable if it didn't work from time to time, that now Ann Wynia's opponent, who voted no on all those things I just said, is trying to convince the senior citizens of this State at the last minute that she is their enemy. [Laughter] Ann Wynia is a friend of children, a friend of working families, a friend of the elderly."", ""Her opponent wants to go to Washington to implement what they said they would do, cut taxes, increase spending, and balance the budget. Does that sound familiar? [Laughter] Folks, let me tell you something, and this is the last thing I want to say. I wasn't going to bring this up, but I heard that he was attacking her for being the enemy of senior citizens. If you promise to increase defense, bring back Star Wars, give the wealthy a tax cut, and balance the budget, there are only two possibilities. One is you're serious, and the other is you're kidding. [Laughter] And when I finish, don't take my word for it; go ask Mr. Penny, he's the budget expert, and he's not running. But we fool with these budgets. If they are serious in doing what they say, here are their options. You've got to cut everything else in the Government 20 percent across the board, including Social Security and Medicare. That is the enemy of seniors. That's $2,000 a person, Social Security."", 'If you say, ""Oh, no, we won\'t cut Social Security,"" because they\'ll always say—they\'ll probably say that here today: ""We didn\'t say we\'d cut Social Security."" They didn\'t say they wouldn\'t. [Laughter] Then you have to cut everything else 30 percent across the board. That devastates the student loan program. That devastates the Head Start program. That devastates the crime bill and putting police on our streets, ask the mayors. In other words, they are the enemy of the solemn contract we had with the elderly people of this country. Unless, of course, they\'re kidding. [Laughter]', 'Now, the last time they had power they were kidding. [Laughter] So what did they do? They talked so tough; they say, ""We are strong; we are tough."" But they acted so weak. And so what happened? They exploded the deficit. They sent our jobs overseas. They put our economy in the drink.', ""Let us say: Sorry, we've been there; we tried that; we didn't like it. We like the unemployment rate going down, the deficit going down, jobs going up, more investment in education, a better future for our kids. We like Ann Wynia. We like hope, not fear. We like the future, not the past. Lift her up. Let's go on. Let's win on Tuesday. We can do it."", 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"
22,William J. Clinton ,"June 09, 1996","['Thank you. Thank you for being outside. All those people in the heat out there, thank you very much. I want to thank the Green Valley High School band. Thank you for playing; you did a great job. I thank those who were here before: Thank you, Mayor Jones; thank you, County Commission Chair Yvonne Gates; thank you, Senator Titus; thank you, Representative Perkins. And most of all, thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for being here. I want to thank your fine Senators, Harry Reid and Dick Bryan, for representing you, standing up for you, and standing up for America in the United States Senate. They do a wonderful job.', ""And I want to thank Governor Bob Miller. You know, he has been the best sort of friend to me because he always tells me when he thinks I'm wrong. [Laughter] And he's been the best sort of Governor for you because even though he's my friend, he's first and foremost somebody who's always fighting for Nevada's interests. And every time he hears anything that might be even potentially bad for Nevada, I know the first call I'm going to get is from Bob Miller. He's made a lot of calls in the last 3 1/2 years for you, and I thank him for that."", ""I also met someone earlier today, and I think he's in the crowd today—he's supposed to be up here with us—State Senator Bob Coffin, who's running for Congress here. I don't know if he's here, but I thought I would—is he back there? Thank you."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, I'm glad to be back in Nevada. I like it here. I'm glad to be back in Las Vegas, which as all of you know was my mother's favorite place on Earth. I've had a wonderful day already. I went out and visited one of your juvenile justice programs, where young people were doing community service and making restitution for mistakes they've made. And I met with some of the young people in the program and some of the adults who were working with them and some of the parents. And I want to compliment you for that."", ""And I want to ask everybody in this room to support people who are out there working with these young kids, trying to get them out of trouble, keep them out of trouble, give them something to do with their lives. We cannot— we cannot—tolerate the situation which now exists in the United States where the crime rate is going down overall but going up among people under 18. And it's because we don't have enough adults that are out there helping these kids to build good lives for themselves. And you've got some good programs here. I want you to support the people that are out there on the front lines in Las Vegas and Nevada working with those kids."", ""Four years ago when I came here and asked you to support me, I had an idea about what I wanted our country to look like as we move into this new century—a very different world. The world I grew up in was dominated by heavy industry and mass production. The world these children will grow up in will be dominated by computers, technology, and information. The world I grew up in had an America that was totally self-contained. We didn't sell much overseas; we didn't buy much from overseas. The cold war was the most important thing and the fight we were having with the communists. The world these kids will grow up in will be dominated by a global society in which children will actually get on computers and do research in libraries in other countries, in which people will be able to move across the world as easily as they used to go across town, and in which we will have to fight those who will seek to take advantage of that through drug running, organized crime, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, preying on open societies and free people. This is a different world."", ""And I had three simple objectives. I wanted America in the 21st century more than anything else still to be a place where every child has the opportunity to make the most of his or her own life, no matter what racial or ethnic or income background they come from. Secondly, I wanted America to be a community of responsible citizens, where we are coming together instead of drifting apart. I am tired of seeing people at election time try to find ways to get us to look down our noses at one another and be divided. When we are together, when we reach across the lines that divide us, when we say our diversity is a great and good thing that makes us stronger in the global society of the 21st century, that's when America's strong; when we're working together, not being driven apart. And finally, I wanted to make sure that when I left office, our country would still be the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity. And I can tell you that on all three fronts we still have a lot of challenges, but this country is in better shape than it was 4 years ago, and we're moving in the right direction."", 'Harry Reid and Dick Bryan will tell you, when I presented my economic plan to the Congress and I said, ""We\'ve got to do something about this terrible deficit; we\'ve got to bring it down, but we cannot—we cannot—do it in a way that undermines our commitment to education or to the environment or protecting the health care of the elderly, the Americans with disabilities, the poorest children in this country,"" there were those on the other side who said, ""If Clinton\'s economic plan passes, it will be a disaster for America; we\'ll be thrown into recession; it will cripple the economy."" Well, you\'ve got 3 1/2 years now to decide. When I took office, the deficit was $290 billion a year, projected to go over $300 billion the next year. It\'s now going to be $130 billion this year, less than half of what it was. When we came into office, we had the slowest job growth rate since the Great Depression. Three and a half years later, we have 9.7 million new jobs for the American people. We are better off than we were 4 years ago.', ""We also passed a crime bill to put more police officers on the street, some of them right here in Las Vegas to prevent crime. We began to work with States to reform welfare and move people from welfare to work. Today there are 1.3 million fewer families on welfare than there were the day I became President of the United States. We made efforts to help families struggling to make the most of their own lives— the family and medical leave law that says you don't lose your job if you have to take a little time off when there's a baby born or somebody in your family who's sick."", ""I was just out at UNLV today. We've reformed the college loan program so that people could borrow their money directly from the United States Government, get it quicker, less hassle, better repayment terms, and that no one would ever have to not go to college because they couldn't afford to borrow the money, because now they can pay it back as a percentage of their income so the loans will never bankrupt anybody. We passed the national service program, AmeriCorps, to give young people a chance to work in their communities and solve problems and help people and work their way through college. That is what we have done."", 'And then when the Congress changed hands in the last 2 years and the Republicans said, ""We want to balance the budget,"" I said, ""So do I. We cut the deficit in half already. We\'ve done half the job, and you wouldn\'t help us; we\'ll help you. We won\'t do you the way you did us; we\'ll help you. But I will not balance the budget by cutting education, by destroying the environment, by undermining our commitment to Medicare and Medicaid. I won\'t do that."" Because that gets into that second issue I was telling you about. We need to come together, not come apart. In the world of the 21st century, education will be the key to opportunity. You know it as well as I do. We cannot walk away from our commitment to give every American the opportunity to get a good education.', ""Look at what you're dealing with here in Nevada with all your growth. You need water here. I'm going to do everything I can to make sure you have it. We can't walk away from our commitment to preserve the environment for all Americans. We have obligations here. We have to do this together."", ""And so I say again to you, I want to balance the budget. I will keep working to do that. We have to do that. When you bring the deficit down, it gets interest rates down; it makes it easier for you to make a home payment, to borrow money for a car, to borrow money for a new business, to create jobs. It is critical. But we can do it. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise. We can do it and preserve our environment, invest in education, and protect Medicare and Medicaid for our seniors. We can do that."", 'And let me say we still have work to do. We still have work to do. If you renew the contract of Bill Clinton and Al Gore, there are other things that we have to do to make sure that all the American people can take advantage of these new opportunities, because you know as well as I do that not everybody in our country, even everybody with a job, is having the same chance to get ahead.', ""What do we need to do? Let me just give you three or four things. First of all—if the Congress doesn't pass it now, we'll do it first thing next year—we need to change the health insurance laws of this country so you don't lose your health insurance when you change jobs or when somebody in your family has been sick. Secondly, we need to change the law so that young people starting out, even if they work for small businesses, can begin to save for their retirement, and they don't lose it if they change jobs; they can keep it all through their lives and they can maintain that. And most important—most important of all, we ought to give every American a tax deduction for the cost of college tuition and a tax credit for 2 years of community college in this country. Every single American ought to be able to go, you know as well as I do."", ""The biggest institution of higher education in Nevada now is the community college here. Why? Because older people have figured out that if they want to be able to get new jobs and raise their incomes, they have to have more education. I was born at a time when the vast majority of Americans did not have a high school education, when many places did not even require them to do it. Now we know that in the world we're living in, you need more. And I think we ought to make it an article of national faith that every single American citizen should have access to at least 2 years of education after high school. And we'll provide it for those families."", ""So I say to you, my fellow Americans, I'm glad to be back here. I appreciate what the Governor said about the issues that are specific to Nevada. What I said about the interim storage was pretty simple: The people that wanted to pass the interim bill wanted to pass it so they could make it permanent. And I don't believe that that should be done. I believe somebody—we're going to have to put this nuclear waste somewhere, but I want to know it was done based on the best science, not the worst politics. That's all I want. And I don't know what the answer to that is."", ""But I want you to think about the future that we've got here. I want you to think about what it's going to take to make sure that all these little kids that are in this house today, in this hangar, every one of them, every one of them—and you look at them. We've got kids in this room whose roots come from every continent on this globe. Just look around here. I want to make sure that every one of them has a chance to live out their dreams if they're willing to be responsible, law-abiding, hard-working American citizens. That's what I want. And that's what you want."", ""That's really what this is all about. You know, politics is not the most important thing in anybody's life. When we all get our lives lived, we look back and we think about the children we raised, the things we loved and cared about. The purpose of politics is to make it possible for more and more and more people to live together in peace and harmony and to live out their dreams and to find their personal greatness and their families' depth and strength and character. That's what this is about. And that's what this election is about. Don't you ever forget it."", ""And remember this: We're all here; we're all happy; we're all feeling good today. It's 5 months between now and the election. That is a very long time. So I say to you, if you believe what brought you here today and you understand how important this is, then I want to ask you to leave here today with a commitment every day between now and November to talk to your friends and your neighbors about what is genuinely at stake. America is deciding on the future of the greatest country in human history for a new century. You can help make the decision the right one."", 'Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you.']"
23,William J. Clinton ,"June 10, 1996","['The President. Thank you very much.', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', 'The President. Thank you. First of all, let me say a special thank you to Don Fowler, the chairman of the Democratic Party, for coming out here to California with me. Thank you, Don. I want to thank Alec Baldwin for his years of support and for his wonderful, loyal devotion to this country. You know, I heard Alec up here giving this speech, and I thought, if he ever gets tired of making movies, he\'d be a pretty good candidate, wouldn\'t he? [Laughter] He did well. I want to thank Joe Walsh and his band. And since he played ""Rocky Mountain Way""—you may not know that since you\'ve been in here, Colorado won the Stanley Cup, the hockey championship tonight, so I thought that was good. I want to thank John Fogerty for all of his music and everything he\'s done over the years. Thank you, John. I thank my good friend Whoopi Goldberg for being here earlier. She had to leave, but I know she was great and did a great job for you.', ""And let me thank all of you who have been part of the Saxophone Club, especially the people who have been working on it. There are people here who have been working on this idea of the Saxophone Club for years now. And the whole idea was we would find a way for Americans who maybe didn't have a lot of money to participate, to contribute, to be a part of our political campaign and our movement to change America, beginning back in 1992, especially younger Americans."", 'And as I look out at you tonight, I know you\'ve been having a good time, and we ought to spend most of our time just sort of listening to music and chanting, ""Four more years!"" It\'s been a hard week; I like hearing that. [Laughter] But I\'d like for you to think just for a couple of minutes about what this election is about, because most of you are considerably younger than I am, and most of you therefore have a much bigger stake in the consequences of the election in the future than I do. And I want you to think about it.', 'When I was out here shaking hands during the music, one young woman over here said, ""Take care of us, Mr. President."" And I said, ""I\'m sure trying to do that."" And I am. But what does that mean? What does that mean? If you think about all the things that are going on in our country today and in our world, all these incredible changes, most of them are working out pretty well for most of you. The future is going to be a time when there will be more different things for people to do to live out their dreams than at any point in human history.', ""And if we do the right things in America, the best days of this country are still ahead of us, because there's no country in the world that is capable of creating opportunity for so many people; no country in the world as capable of bringing together so many different peoples across all the racial and ethnic and religious and other lines that divide us, into a common family; no nation in the world so capable of leading the world toward greater peace and freedom and human dignity and prosperity. And that's really what this election is all about."", ""You are lucky enough to be living through the period of greatest change that our country has experienced in the way we work, the way we live, and the way we relate to the rest of the world in 100 years, since we've moved from farm to factory and from the country to the city. Now we're moving from a national economy and the cold war to a global village, away from an industrial age to one dominated by information, technology, computers. Bill Gates, the great computer genius, says that the microchip has launched the greatest revolution in communication not in 100 years but in 500 years. That's what all of you have inherited. And we have to decide what we're going to do with it. And that's what this whole debate is about."", ""I believe the purpose of my office and your Government is to, first and foremost, create opportunity for everybody; to give every person, without regard to where they start in life, a chance to live out their dreams. I believe that, therefore, it is worth fighting to do what we've done. We've cut the deficit by more than half. Our economy has produced almost 10 million new jobs. We're moving forward in a dramatic way. I think that's important."", ""But not everybody has the opportunity to participate in this, and I won't be satisfied until everybody does. That's why, if you will reelect me, I'll do everything I can to guarantee that every single American citizen has a guarantee of 2 more years of education after high school— for every single, solitary person—that every American will be able to afford to go to college, and that you will be able to deduct the cost of college tuition from your income taxes, that every American will always have access to lifetime education. Most of you will be doing things 10 or 20 years from now—or many of you will— you'll be doing work that literally has not even been invented yet. And if I could do one thing for this country as President to create a structure of opportunity that would carry us way into the next century, it would be create a seamless web of lifetime education that every American could move in and out of, just like rolling down a river—very important."", ""Second thing I want to say to you is, it's very fashionable for people to condemn Government and say that Government is the source of all of our problems. But Government is nothing more or less than the rest of us; it is our reflection. And there are things we have to do in common. We need safe streets in common. We need a clean environment in common. We need a commitment to maintaining our own security against terrorism and dangerous weapons and drug runners and organized crime in common. We need these things in common."", ""And so when people tell you that they're going to get the Government off your back, you just remember it was our administration that reduced the size of the Federal Government by 240,000 people. But when California had an earthquake, when California had a fire, when California was broken down by the cutbacks in defense, you did not need weakness. You needed people to come in and help with the emergencies, to help with defense conversion, to help to rebuild this State, to help to rebuild this country."", 'Audience member. Four more years!', ""The President. And I just want to say one other thing. Every election time we're asked to blame one another for our problems. You just think about it. Every election time, somebody comes along, they find out who is not happy, and they try to tell you some other group of Americans you can blame for your difficulties. But the truth is, we're going into the future, up or down, together. The truth is, no great democracy has ever existed with as much diversity as this one has today. This county where we are tonight, this single county, has people from 150 different racial and ethnic groups. And I say, thank God for it. It is our ticket to success in a global economy."", ""So if you believe with me that this election is about creating opportunity for every American, not a guarantee but an opportunity to live out your dreams; and if you believe we have to do some things in common, give our children safe streets and a clean environment, good schools and a brighter future; and if you believe that this country still has a mission to stand up for freedom and decency and honor around the world wherever we can, so that we can grow together in a world that's coming together instead of coming apart, that's what's worth fighting for in this election."", ""This is not an election like 1992, where it's change against the status quo. This is an election where there are two very different deeply held views of change. And you have to pick which road you're going to walk right into the next century and what your country's road will be for 20 or 30 or 50 years. That is the choice that devolves on you. And I'll say again, most of you in this crowd tonight are younger than I am. Most of you still have more tomorrows than yesterdays. Your life, your children, your grandchildren's life, that's what's really at stake."", ""We're having a great time. I want you to love being in the Saxophone Club. I want you to go to more rallies and scream and shout and say hallelujah and have a good time and show everybody that we like what we're doing and we believe in it and we're feeling good. I want you to do that. But I don't want you to forget that this enterprise in which we're engaged is by no means resolved. This election is 4 months and 3 weeks and 1 day away. [Laughter] And that is an eternity. And I'm telling you, every one of you, every day between now and then, every single one of you will come in contact with someone that you can influence, someone you can get involved in a discussion about your country, someone you can force to think about the problems and the promise of America in a different way, someone you can convince that their vote makes a difference, that they really can shape the future of this country."", ""So I want to ask you, if you like being here tonight, if you're proud of what you're doing, if you believe in what we are trying to do together, then promise yourself when you walk out of here you're going to be a good citizen every single day between now and election day, November, and you will have the future that you deserve and that you can dream of."", 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"

They did a great job."", ""And, Mayor Daley, it's good to be in Chicago. And I'll be back before you know it. I thank you for having us all here."", ""I always love to come to Chicago, and I like to—we flew in a helicopter down to Meigs Field, and we got to fly over some of the suburbs—and I always reminisce when I do. But a lot of you know that Hillary was born in Chicago and grew up in Park Ridge. And I wish she were here today, but she is representing our country on a tour of nine Central and Eastern European nations. So I talked to her last night; she'd just finished the day in Romania. So I wish she were here, but she's over there talking about countries who love freedom. [Applause] Thank you."", ""I want to thank you for something else that I know you feel, and that is, it meant a lot to me when I took this recent trip to Europe to have the annual meeting of the seven largest industrial countries and then a meeting with those countries and Russia about political challenges facing the world to know that the people back home were not only outraged by the murder of our service people in Saudi Arabia but determined to stand against terrorism wherever it exists. And I know you must have been proud this morning to read in the newspaper that our Federal law enforcement officials thwarted a planned attempt to blow up buildings in Arizona. I thank them for that, and I'm proud of them."", ""I can tell you this: In this open world of ours where we can all move around the world and ideas and information and money and technology can move around the world in a split second, we are more vulnerable to the organized forces of intolerance and hatred and terrorism. But we can also prevent a lot of these things. I have seen it work here in the United States in the last 3 years, where we've headed off a number of such incidences. I see it happen in the Middle East, where incidences not only occur but many more are headed off. And we're going to have to work at this, work it together, and other nations need to work with us, because this is our common security threat after the cold war. And we can whip this if we'll stay together and work together. And we have to do that."", ""The other thing I'd like to say is that I signed a proclamation late last night proclaiming this month as National Unity Month and asking all Americans to find ways in their places of worship or in other places to stand up against this terrible wave of church bombings and the desecration of other houses of worship that we are seeing across this country. Just before I came to see you I announced that we reallocated a few million dollars to the 12 States that have seen the great bulk of these church burnings so that every county will receive some funds either to hire extra officers or to have people work overtime, or to help churches put up security equipment or lighting at night, to do something to try to prevent these things from occurring."", 'But we also need to change the atmosphere. If you\'ve seen the profiles coming out on a lot of the people who have been charged with these church burnings, they seem to be no discernible conspiracy but instead a lot of people who share common problems, people who have disappointments in their own lives, frustrations in their own lives, and somehow think instead of saying, ""Well, what can I do to straighten myself out or who can I go to""—whom can I go to—""to ask for help,"" they say, ""Well, I\'m just going to be mad and burn a black church.""', 'And you know, this is something that is sort of endemic to human nature. When you\'re in a crisis in your life, you can either say, ""What can I do to fix it,"" or ""How can I get some help,"" or you can look for somebody else to blame or say, ""Well, no matter how bad off I am there is somebody that\'s even lower than I am, and I\'m going to punish them."" And we have to stand up against that. We have to change the atmosphere in the country.', ""Don't forget, this country was founded on a belief in religious liberty. A lot of the first people who came to the shores of the United States came here because they wanted to come to a place where nobody would tell them how to worship God, and they could make their own mind up."", ""Don't forget that the first amendment to the Constitution not only protects the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, and the freedom of assembly, it protects the freedom of religion. It is the first amendment to the Constitution. And over our entire history we have displayed a fidelity to it that has kept our country strong. And we dare not allow this to continue without every American of conscience, without regard to their race, their region, or their political party, speaking up against it. It is wrong, and we must stand together."", 'For more than 30 years now, you have been fighting the good fight you were cheering about today, fighting first for Medicare and for Medicaid and for Social Security and then fighting to protect it. I am very proud that one of the things that happened last year with the leadership of Senator Moynihan primarily is that we finally made Social Security an independent agency, giving the autonomy it needs to fulfill its mission.', ""You know as well as I do that your fight for the well-being and the dignity of American seniors has never been more important than it is now. You know that the victories that we won through the veto pen in 1995 didn't solve the fundamental problem of securing the Medicare Trust Fund in a way that honors the dignity of the seniors of this country or protects our sense of fairness. I am proud to stand with you. But what you do from here forward is central to our mission as we move into the 21st century."", ""When I ran for President, I said to all of you that I wanted to lead our country into the next century to ensure three things. I wanted the American dream to be a living reality to every person who is willing to work for it, without regard to their race, their gender, their region, or what they start out with in life. I wanted this country to be coming together around all of its ethnic and racial and religious diversity, instead of being torn apart the way so many countries around the world are. And I wanted this country to continue to be the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity."", 'At the end of the cold war, if the world is not going to be divided into the Communist and non-Communist world, and if we can force the nuclear threat to recede, we still have to have somebody out there standing up for human decency around the world and peace and freedom. You see that in Bosnia. You see it in Haiti. You see it in the fight against terrorism.', ""And it seemed to me that in order to accomplish these things we had to ask ourselves: Okay, the cold war is over. We're living in a new kind of world. All right, we're not dominated by large industrial bureaucracies and large government bureaucracies and mass production anymore. High technology and the information revolution has changed dramatically manufacturing and agriculture and every form of human endeavor. So we changed the way we work; we changed the way we live; we changed the way we are relating to the rest of the world— big changes, 100-year changes. Now what?"", ""And it seemed to me that we had to start by saying we have to meet these challenges in a way that protects our values. And one of the values that has made this country strong for over 200 years is recognizing that we are, none of us, in this alone. We have responsibilities to each other. That's really what all these debates are about."", ""So if, for example, if you just take Medicare. If there's a problem with Medicare, solve the problem, but don't solve it by asking families to go back to the days when they had to choose between health care for the parents or college educations for the kids. That's not the answer to solve that problem."", ""This is about more than money. This is about what we are as a people. What are our obligations to our parents, and what are our parents' obligations to their grandchildren? How can we make these decisions in a way that allows America to grow but to grow together, to go forward together, so that we all feel like we're in this together and that we're growing stronger because we're holding hands and working together?"", ""Now, that is what I believe we should be doing. And I don't think it's very complicated. I think we need a strategy which says our role is to create opportunity, not guarantees but opportunity for people to make the most of their own lives, to insist that our citizens act with personal responsibility, and to build a stronger sense of community, to recognize that we're all in this together, we do have certain obligations to one another, and we're all going to do better if everybody has a chance to do well, and that we can't lift up one group by keeping another down. We have to make these decisions together. That's the way to do it."", ""Take the economy. Four years ago our economy was drifting, unemployment was high, the deficit was out of control, we had the slowest job growth since the Great Depression. I wanted to chart a new course. And I said what we ought to do with this economy is to have a disciplined plan to move us into the 21st century with a growing economy that everybody had a chance to benefit from. Let's cut the deficit, get interest rates down, get investment into creating jobs and homes up. Let's continue to invest in the education of our children, the education of adults, high technology, research, the things that will create good jobs. Let's have more trade, but let's make sure it's not only free trade but fair trade. Let's do these things, and it will work."", ""I also believed very strongly that we had to do more to help working families to succeed at work and to succeed at home. You know, a lot of people talk about welfare. Well, one of the things that I figured out was we had a tax system that was punishing people at the low end of the wage scale who chose work over welfare. We doubled the family tax credit called the earned-income tax credit so we could say if you're working 40 hours a week and you've got a child in the home, we will not tax you into poverty. You should be out of poverty. We will lift you out of poverty with the tax system. It was pro-family."", ""We fought for the family and medical leave law, which simply said if you have a sick parent or a newborn baby and you have to take some time off work, you won't lose your job. It was a good bill, and it was the right thing to do."", ""Now, when we passed this economic plan, I predicted that if it passed, we'd be able to cut the deficit in half in 4 years and the American people would produce 8 million new jobs, even though we were going to reduce the size of the National Government. Well, the Republicans in the Congress fought us tooth and nail. And I'll give them credit; every one of them voted against it. [Laughter] They didn't fool around; they were united. [Laughter]"", 'Speaker Gingrich, then the minority leader, said, ""I believe this will lead to a recession next year."" Now the majority leader, Mr. Armey, said of my economic plan, ""Clearly this is a job killer."" [Laughter] Senator Gramm said, ""We are buying a one-way ticket to a recession. The American economy is going to get weaker, not stronger, and 4 years from today the deficit will be higher than it is today and not lower."" Senator Dole said, ""President Clinton knows, and the American people know, the plan does not tackle the deficit."" And John Kasich, the head of the Budget Committee, from Ohio, said——', 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. Wait, let me quote this. Here is what he said of our economic plan, quote, ""This plan will not work. If it was to work then I\'d have to become a Democrat."" [Laughter] Well, I want to tell Mr. Kasich that Mayor Daley is saving a seat for him at the convention, because it works. It does.', 'I don\'t know how they define ""work,"" but in 3 1/2 years the deficit, now we know, will be cut by more than half. We know the American people did not produce 8 million jobs in 4 years, they produced 9.7 million jobs in 3 1/2 years; 3.7 million new homeowners; an all-time high in the export of American products; a record number for 3 years in a row of new businesses starting up. And for the first time in 10 years, thank goodness, average hourly earnings for working families are starting to go up. The lowest combined rates of unemployment and inflation in almost 30 years. I think it\'s fair to say that based on the evidence, when it came to the economy, we were right, and they were wrong.', ""Of course, we have more to do. The minimum wage this year is going to drop to a 40year low in what it will buy if we don't raise it. You can't raise a family on 4.25 an hour. And if this Congress really believes in work and family values, let them go back and raise the minimum wage like they ought to."", ""And we ought to pass the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill and pass it now, unadulterated, so people won't lose their health insurance when they change jobs or someone in their family has been sick. We also ought to make sure that we do a number of other things. I've sent a package of retirement legislation to the Congress to make it easier for self-employed people and small-business people to take out retirement plans and then to keep it even if they go through periods of unemployment or when they change jobs. There are lots of other things we need to do. But the last thing we need to do is to reverse a course that is working."", ""I also believe that when people get to the end of their working lives, they shouldn't have to worry about whether they can feed themselves when they retire. Nor, however, should they have to worry about whether Medicare will be there for them."", ""Now, I noticed when our friends on the other side debate Medicare in Washington, they never tell people that one of the important things that we did in our 1993 economic plan was to strengthen the Medicare Trust Fund, to add a few years to it. And they attacked us every step of the way for trying to do it, and in fact in the '94 election promised to undo what we had done to strengthen the Medicare Trust Fund and protect the financial integrity of Medicare. It's why we fought for the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act, so that seniors can get the nutrition and transportation and other services they need."", ""It's why I have worked so hard to pass and then to protect that crime bill. How many seniors would say that their number one concern over the last 5 years has been their personal safety? And again I would say, if you just look at the record this administration has worked on in the area of criminal justice and law enforcement—we passed the Brady bill, requiring a waiting period before people can buy handguns; we passed the crime bill, which put 100,000 more police on the street over a period of 6 years. I can tell you this: We are ahead of schedule with those police officers and under budget. And they are making a difference to lower the crime rate in America."", ""We passed the ban on assault weapons. And again, the leadership of the other side fought us every step of the way. They said we shouldn't give the communities any money to try to help prevention programs, to spend money to keep kids working in the summertime or giving them some things to do after school, instead of to walk the streets. They said that this was a waste of money, even though police officers were screaming for it all over America, so that our young people could have something to say yes to as well as something to say no to."", ""They said if we passed the assault weapons ban and the Brady bill, we were just going to take everybody's gun away from them. Well, I'll tell you something, we've now been through two deer seasons—[laughter]—and where I live, every last hunter that hadn't wanted to buy a new gun is still hunting with the same rifle they had when those guys were trying to scare them to death. But there are some people who didn't get guns: 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers didn't get guns because of the Brady bill. We were right, and they were wrong."", 'Ask Mayor Daley, a former prosecutor, about Chicago. Community policing, preventive strategies: the crime rate is down in virtually every major city in this country in every major category. Substantial drop in the murder rate, just from last year, right here in Chicago. So those people who fought the crime bill were wrong. They were wrong. The evidence is here. And that has to do with how senior citizens live.', ""We know that as we look to the future, we have to find a way to control medical inflation. Of course we do. We have to find a way to try to bring inflation in health care down to the level of inflation in the country and keep it there. We know that as there's more seniors relative to workers in the population, we have to deal with that. We know that we have to have integrity in the Medicare Trust Fund. Can we do that without creating two classes of people under Medicare? Can we do it without destroying the guarantees of Medicaid to families with people with disabilities, to elderly people in nursing homes, to poor women and their infant children? You bet we can. We've done it before. We can do it again, and we will do it."", 'Medicaid, most people think, is a program for poor people. The truth is only about 30 percent of it goes to help poor families, pregnant women, and little children. Seventy percent of it goes to care for our senior citizens, most of whom come from middle class families, to enable their children to have stable lives and raise their children and educate them, and to go to help families with family members with disabilities, many of whom can live at home or independently because of Medicaid, many of whom are able to raise their children with serious disabilities at home without going into bankruptcy or having to give up their jobs because of Medicaid.', 'Now, can we do things to slow the rate of inflation there, to give the people on Medicaid more choices, to have more incentives to do all kinds of things? Yes, we can. Should we walk away from the guarantee we have given to try to help make people secure in their health care? No, we should not. No, we should not. Are there other strategies we can follow? You bet there are. What about preventive health care?', ""One of the things that I tried to do—it's turned out to be very controversial and I now see why no previous President ever wanted to get into this—is I believe that we should take strong action to stop the advertising, sales, and transference of cigarettes to children. I think it's wrong."", ""You talk about saving money. Three thousand children a day smoke—start smoking—begin. Three thousand children a day begin. One thousand of them will have their lives shortened because of it. And along the way society will pick up a significant part of the health care bill. Now, that's one way to save money."", ""Now, I have been amazed at the debate that's injected itself into the national campaign on this issue. I notice that Senator Dole questioned the other day whether or not tobacco was really addictive for everybody. [Laughter] And then, apparently, this morning, when it was—he was asked about Dr. Koop, who was President Reagan's Surgeon General, a remarkable man, who may be a Republican for all I know—President Reagan's Surgeon General, but he has been one of our most outspoken advocates of trying to stop smoking among young people—and this morning Senator Dole suggested that maybe Dr. Koop had been brainwashed by the liberal media. [Laughter] Well, I imagine Dr. Koop was surprised to hear that. [Laughter] I believe Dr. Koop knows more about the dangers of tobacco than the so-called liberal media or Senator Dole. He's out there fighting for our children, and that's what we need more people to do, fight for children and not play politics with this issue."", ""Medicaid today spends at least $10 billion in Federal and State funds to pay for treatment for smoking-related illnesses. Now, if we're going to get serious about cutting the costs, that's one way to do it without hurting families. It will help families, it will strengthen families."", ""And finally, let me say that this sort of partisan division has only made the Medicare Trust Fund problem worse. Let's face it, we have enough savings identified in both the Republican plan and my plan to take the Medicare Trust Fund out to a decade right now. And we don't know yet whether we won't be able to find more in the development of managed care, voluntary options for seniors, and other things that are happening in the marketplace right now."", ""Now, why don't we go ahead and do this? Why are we holding out? Why is the Congress holding out for an agreement that would essentially develop a two-class Medicare system, where the older and the poorer and the sicker you are, the more likely you are to be in yesterday's Medicare that's underfunded; and the younger and healthier and more well off you are, the more options you're given to walk away. That's not what made Medicare work. What made Medicare work is you say, we have obligations to each other, and we're going to fulfill them. We're going to do this and solve this together. I think that is the right thing to do."", ""But you need to understand, every health care program—there is no such thing as a problemfree health care program. You have to manage this as it goes along. You have to deal with the population, what happens to people, what the costs are. But I'd just like for you to remember two things when all these people tell you how bad Medicare is, how it needs to be worked over and changed and, in effect, deconstructed. I'd just like for you to remember two things— the same thing for Medicaid—number one, Medicare has the smallest administrative overhead cost of any insurance program, public or private, in the entire United States of America, and number two—number two and far more important, America's longevity, unfortunately, is not as high as some countries, but the main reason is, we have lamentably higher rates of violence among young people, we have higher rates of AIDS, which kills a lot of young people in this country, and our infant mortality rate in some places is still higher than it is in some countries. But if you live to be 65 in the United States, you have the highest life expectancy of any group of seniors in the world. Medicare, Social Security, SSI, that's what did that. Now, I can't believe we can't fix the problem of the financing in a way that preserves the fact that we have the seniors with the highest life expectancy in the world, with a program that already has the lowest administrative costs in the world. This is not rocket science. This is politics."", ""So I would say again, this is a great philosophical divide—should we abandon Medicaid's guarantee to poor women and little children——"", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', 'The President. ——to families with disabilities, to the seniors in the nursing homes?', 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. No. Should we create in Medicare—we're not talking about saving money here; we're not talking about securing the trust fund for a decade. We're talking about whether we should create a two-class system of care."", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. You know, if I stay healthy— I don't know if I can the way things are in Washington—[laughter]—but if I stay healthy, I retire as President, and I have a nice pension, you know, I'll probably be fine. Their system might be great for me, I could walk away. But what about my responsibilities to everybody else? What about everybody else's—what about our responsibilities?"", ""So, again, I would say that the Senate has new leadership and we have—we have identified the savings necessary to secure the Medicare Trust Fund. Why should we go into a work stoppage just because it's election season? Let's go ahead and secure the Medicare Trust Fund for another decade. You know how we're going to save the money and you said okay, and we can do that."", ""I know, you know, we've had a good time today, and I know that I'm here preaching to the saved—[laughter]. It makes it easier. But let me tell you, there is a serious issue here. We have serious questions to deal with. We all know that we're living longer and that the distribution of population is changing. We have to come to grips with these things. The only thing I'm saying is I believe the seniors of this country care about their children and grandchildren and their great-grandchildren."", 'When I was the Governor of my State, I spent most of my time trying to improve the education of our children, and I got most of my support for it from people who were in their golden years, who were more than happy to come up and invest more money or do whatever it took to make sure that their grandchildren had a bright future.', ""I do not want to see the generations in this country pitted against each other. We can find a clearly nonpolitical, bipartisan, evenhanded, sensible solution to any problem the generational changes are going to face this country with, as long as we don't use it as an excuse to divide this country one from another and to be unfair to the seniors in their quest, legitimately, to have a good life. You know it, and I know it."", ""I want to just say two things in closing. While I think we have obligations to you, I am impressed by how many of you still think that you've got plenty of energy to exercise obligations to other people, and I thank you for that. I thank you for that. I thank you for becoming foster grandparents or working with troubled young people or becoming mentors and tutors. Those kids need people like you, and we need more kids with more seniors helping them one on one."", ""I thank those who have joined our National Senior Service Corps. I thank those who work with other seniors who aren't as well off as they are either financially or physically. I thank you for your wisdom and your vigor. And I ask you to bring that wisdom and vigor not just to those who agree with you in the next 4 months, but to others as well."", ""We have here a very clear choice. And in a way that's a happy thing for America because you don't have to guess this time. You know, in lots of elections—in lots of election there's a certain amount of guesswork. But you know what I will do. First of all, you know that we did what we said we'd do, or we got caught trying to do it. [Applause] Thank you."", 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. Thank you. Thank you. And that the results have been good. Compared to 4 years ago, we're better off than we were on the economy. We're better off than we were when it comes to crime. We've proved that you can protect the environment and grow the economy. We have worked with the States to move people from welfare to work. And while others in Washington talked about it, we now have 1.3 million fewer people on welfare than we did the day I became President."", ""We've proved that you can shrink the size of the Federal Government without being cruel to the Federal employees or undermining the quality of Federal service. We have proved, in other words, that we could grow the economy with opportunity and responsibility and a stronger sense of community. That's the first thing."", ""The second thing is, there's lots more to do. Our country's transformation into the 21st century is far from complete. I proposed the other day that we amend the family and medical leave law to let people have a few hours off a year to go to regular conferences with their kids and make regular doctor's appointments with their parents if they need it, or their children if they need it. That's a good thing to do, a simple thing to do. I proposed making 2 more years of education after high school universal for everyone through a system of tax credits that would let everybody go to their nearest community college. And there are lots of other things that we have to do."", ""And the third point I want to make is, on the you-don't-have-to-guess point is, you know where I stand, and you know where they stand. And if the American people want the budget that they passed in 1995 that I vetoed, they can get it. They can get it. But you need to talk to your friends and neighbors about this. Six months into 1997, if they had the White House and the Congress, that budget would be the law of the land. If you think it's a bad idea that we're putting 100,000 police on the street, and you want to remove that commitment and just throw money at the problem, you can get that. They did that once, but I stopped them."", ""If you think that I was wrong to take on this tobacco issue or wrong to require the Vchip in the new television sets so that parents have some control over the things their young children watch, if you think I was wrong about the family leave law and you don't want it extended, you can have someone who agrees with you, who believes—who led the fight—who led the fight against everything I said."", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""Audience member. We'll stand with you, Bill!"", ""The President. But what I want you to do is not just stand with me, I want you to go home and explain it to everybody else. That's what I want you to do. I want you to explain it to everybody else. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you."", ""Now, let me say one other thing. Let me say one thing. I'm going to do my best in the next 4 months to give this country back to the people, just like I tried to do in 1992. I want this election process to be in the hands of the American people, and I'm going to do everything I can to see that they get a chance to make these decisions based upon what will happen afterward that affects their lives, their children's lives, and the future of this country."", ""There is no nation in the world as well-positioned for the next century as the United States—no nation. All we have to do is to make sure that we give people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives, do everything we can to ensure responsibility from all of our citizens, and remind everybody that we are in this together. This is the greatest country in the world today because, in wave after wave after wave after wave over 200 years, we have steadily built a bigger group of American success stories. I believe we're in this together. That is the choice the American people face."", ""And if you go out there and remind people of the example and the story of your own lives, you can look into the future for people who are younger than you are. You can help them to take their blinders off; you can help to make sure that they're not distracted. And you can ask them to stand up to the finest and best in this country. And that will ensure a good result, not just in November but far more important for our children and our grandchildren."", 'Thank you, and God bless you.']"

And I felt so good when it was over because they were such impressive people and they represented what I am hoping we can bring to all the American people.', ""I want to just give you two or three arguments that I want you to make to everybody between now and November. Four years ago, I got into this remarkable adventure because I was convinced that our country was drifting into the 21st century instead of charging into it and because I thought we were being more divided when we needed to come together and because I thought our leadership in the world was being undermined because of our problems at home. And I had this vision of what we are going to look like when we go ripping into the next century with the American dream alive for every single citizen willing to work for it, with America coming together and celebrating our diversity as an enormous strength instead of being divided by, and with our country still the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity around the world."", ""That is the way to guarantee you the future to which you're entitled and to make the future for your children and your grandchildren be what it ought to be. And I had a fairly simple strategy. I said I'm going to emphasize things that create opportunity, that call forth greater responsibility and that bring us together. I'm going to try to stop all the politics of division and start putting people together. I'm going to try, for example, to answer the real question for most working families, which is how do you succeed at home and at work? How do you avoid sacrificing one for the other and instead come together and move forward together?"", 'Now, I want you to make three arguments to everybody you see between now and then. Argument number one: We had a vision; we had a strategy; we had a plan. We implemented it, and the results were good. And we had to fight them on every step of the way on most of what we did.', ""We put our economic plan into effect. They said it would bring on a recession. It brought on 10 million new jobs. And 8 million people refinanced their homes, and 3.7 million Americans became first-time homebuyers. We had record numbers of new businesses in each of the last 3 years. We expanded trade at a record level, 200 separate agreements. It's working economically."", 'We had a plan to fight crime. They fought us every step of the way. We said we need more police on the street, we need tougher punishments, but we need to give our kids something to say yes to. We need to do something about the assault weapons, and we need to do something to require waiting periods so we can check to see if people have violated the law. And we implemented it.', ""And for 4 years in a row now, the crime rate has been coming down in America. And all those people that jumped me about the assault weapons ban and the Brady bill, let me tell you something, there's not a single hunter in Colorado that has lost a rifle because of the assault weapons ban or the Brady bill. But I'll tell you who has lost out: There are 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers that don't have handguns today because of the Brady bill. It was the right thing to do."", ""When it came to welfare reform I said I thought we ought to be good to the kids and tough on work, not tough on the kids and easy on work. We had a big argument in Washington about it. But I believe we were right: 75 percent of the American people on welfare today are already under welfare-to-work experiments, and there are 1.3 million fewer people on welfare than there were the day I took the oath of office, and I'm proud of that."", ""They said the Government was the problem and we ought to get rid of it. I said the Government had a lot of problems and we ought to fix them so that we could have a Government that would be on our side and help us to make the most of our own lives. So today we have a Government that's 240,000 people smaller than it was the day I took the oath of the office. We're getting rid of 16,000 pages of regulation, but we didn't give up on things like protecting the environment and the public health. We fought them every step of the way, and we prevailed on something that was very important."", ""And the world is a safer place and we are further along the road toward peace because of the things that have been done. A lot of them were unpopular, but they were the right things to do. So the first thing you can say is, the President and his team, they had a plan. They implemented it, and it's gotten good results. And they did it by bringing the American people together across the lines of race and religion and region and income and all the other ways we're divided, by getting people together."", ""The second point I want you to make is that there's a big choice in this election, and the voters should be very happy because there is no guesswork. [Laughter] Now, you know— you're laughing, but it's true. I mean, when you voted for me, when I carried Colorado in 1992, you took a chance on me. You took Governor Romer's word for me—[laughter]—I mean, you know, you sort of took a chance. You said, I think I'll vote for him. Well, now you know who I am, and you know what I've done, and you know what I will do. But you know who they are, and you know what they've done, and you know what they will do. And you know you know what they will do, because they already did it, and I just vetoed it the first time."", ""So if your idea—this is very serious. We're having a good time, and I want you to have a good time, but this is dead serious. I'm telling you, if you want the budget that they passed in 1995—that created a two-tiered system of Medicare putting the oldest, the poorest, and the sickest seniors at the most vulnerability, that walked away from a 30-year commitment we had to health care and families with children and other members with disabilities, to poor pregnant women and their infant children, to elderly people in nursing homes—if you believe the way to balance the budget is to gut the Nation's support for a clean environment and for education, you can have it. They did it once, but I vetoed it. If they have the Congress and the White House, within 6 months it'll be the law of the land. You tell people that."", ""There's no guesswork in this election. Choose—if you want that instead of continuing to walk into the future, you can get it. I think I know what choice people will make if they understand it clearly."", ""And the third thing, and maybe the most important thing of all, is that this country's business is not finished. Are we better off than we were 4 years ago? You bet we are. Are we ready to go into the 21st century in the shape America deserves to be in? No, we are not. No, we are not. We still have a lot of challenges. Economically, our challenge is to take our ability to create jobs and give it to all the American people so that everybody has a chance to live up to the fullest of their Godgiven abilities. And the only way to do that is to improve the quality and the reach of education in America. We should not be cutting back on education, we should be investing in it and expanding opportunity."", ""Let me tell you something. We're on the verge of having a system, because of the technological changes in the information age, which could give a student in the smallest, poorest, rural community in Colorado or my home State of Arkansas every bit of educational opportunity that students in the wealthiest suburban districts in America have because of the computer and the information age. And I am determined to hook up every classroom in America to the information superhighway by the year 2000."", ""There's a lot of talk about tax cuts in the air in Washington. We have to be careful because we've got to balance that budget. But there is one tax cut that would pay for itself many times over. We ought to give people a tax deduction for the cost of college tuition and a tax credit for 2 years of community college, no matter what their rate, anywhere in America. That would be the best money we ever spent."", 'It would allow us to grow together and go forward together.', ""We have a lot of unfinished agenda in the environment. We still have to prove, really prove, that we can grow the economy and not just maintain the environment but improve it. We just got a new cable setup in Washington, and they've got one of these sci-fi—the Sci-Fi Channel on it. And my daughter's got me interested in science fiction again. So when I come in late at night, sometimes I take the channel and I channel surf the way you do, and I settle on the Sci-Fi Channel. It is astonishing how many science fiction movies about the future project an America on an Earth with a destroyed environment, isn't it? Still, they just assume we're going to be so dumb we're going to use it up. We're going to burn up the air and cut down all the trees and pollute all the water. And we'll all be living in some kind of bubble. It's amazing, still, those movies are just pouring out. That does not have to be the case."", 'But it is an outmoded idea that you can grow the economy and stick it to the environment. You have to grow the economy by preserving and enhancing the environment. That is our challenge as we move through the 21st century.', ""So those three arguments—I want you to go out and make those three arguments. Number one, the President had an idea. He had a plan. We implemented it. The results are good. We're better off than we were 4 years ago. Number two, we don't have to guess in this election. There's a huge difference. And there's no status quo option. There are these two different bridges you can walk across to the 21st century, and we like the one we're on, not the one they tried to put us on. And number three, there's a lot of unfinished business here. And the ideas that Bill Clinton and Al Gore and the new Democratic Party have brought to America are the right ideas. That's the argument I want you to make."", 'And I want you to just think about what you saw the other night at the Olympics. And let me just tell you a little something that you didn\'t see. You know, Hillary and I went to the Olympics; we got to spend all day kind of just gawking around at those great looking athletes. And we went and had lunch with a lot of the international athletes. But I want to tell you something. I met a young man from Ireland who almost had tears in his eyes who said, ""You know, I loved it when we had peace in Ireland, and it broke my heart when they broke the peace. You and America helped to bring us peace. I hope you can get it back for us.""', ""I met a young man from Croatia who was a whole head taller than me, which is a pretty good size even today. [Laughter] And he thanked me for Ron Brown's trade mission to Croatia where Ron and the other people from our Government, those business leaders, died, and for his successor, Mickey Kantor, to come over and finish it. I mean, this guy's talking to me about a trade mission at the Olympics because of what America meant to his country."", 'I met a young man with the Palestinian team who said, ""Mr. President, the Palestinians, my people, we\'re a very old people, but we never had an Olympic team, not ever, until we made peace with Israel. And I thank you for that. And you need to know that a lot of us want to keep that peace. We want to keep that peace.""', ""And then Hillary and I went—then we went to meet with the American team. And I looked at them, and I thought, you know, if they were just all divided up walking around, you wouldn't know where they were from. Some of them look like they were from Latin America, others look like they were from Asia, others look like they're from the Middle East. Some of them looked like they were from Scandinavia. You know what? They all were. [Laughter] That's the unique thing about this country. And that's what makes this special."", ""Look around this room tonight. We're bound together by a set of ideas, a set of values, a set of beliefs. Oh yes, we have to fight it, too. That's what this church burning business is all about. When people put swastikas on mosques or on the doors of African-American soldiers at Fort Bragg in the Special Forces, or they torch the Islamic centers that have been burned in this country, we still have to fight that. But it's tearing the heart out of Rwanda and Burundi and Bosnia and the Middle East and Northern Ireland."", ""And that's the last thing I want to tell you. We've got to do this together. The thing that makes us magic is when we are helping each other do better, when we're lifting each other up, when we don't define ourselves by our resentments, and we don't define ourselves by whether we can look down on somebody that looks different from us. That's what makes us special. That's our genius. That's what's good about America."", 'And I want to say this, especially to the young people in this audience—you know, I\'ve learned as I get older that the definition of young is whoever\'s younger than you are. [Laughter] My friend who died last year at the age of 89, Senator Bill Fulbright, was having dinner a couple of years ago with Mike Mansfield, who was our Ambassador to Japan for many years. At the time, Fulbright was 87 and Mansfield was 90. And Mansfield still—he\'s 92; he walks 5 miles every day. He looked at Fulbright, who was 87, and he said, ""Now how old are you?"" And he said, ""87."" And Mansfield said, ""Oh, to be 87 again."" [Laughter] I say that because young is whoever\'s younger than you. Most of you are younger to me. I get my AARP card this year. [Laughter]', ""So what I want you to think about is this, particularly if you're thirty-something, twentysomething: Imagine what you would like your country to look like when your children are your age. Imagine what you would like your country to look like when you have grandchildren that are your age. And I'll bet you anything you want the American dream alive and well for everybody who have worked for it. You want America to be coming together, not drifting apart. And you want your country to still be the world's leader for peace and freedom and prosperity."", ""That is what this is all about. It's not about me or the Vice President or Senator Dole or the Republicans. It's about what this country's going to look like in the 21st century. We're not drifting now; we're roaring there. And I want us to keep doing it."", 'Thank you, and God bless you.']"
26,William J. Clinton ,"August 08, 1996","[""Thank you very much. I am delighted to be here. I want to thank all of you for coming. I want to thank the cochairs of this event and Hannah Bond, the director of the Saxophone Club. Thank you all very much. I want to thank Dave Koz and his band, and B.J. and the Boys. And I want to say to my good friend Whoopi Goldberg—she is a national marvel, isn't she? And here she was tonight actually playing it straight. And that just shows you how serious she is about winning this election. If you're as serious as she is, we're going to be okay in November. I also saw Magic Johnson over there. I thank him for being here tonight. Thank you, Magic."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, I want to be brief tonight so I can get out and shake hands and say hello to you, but I want to say just a couple of things—just bear with me for a moment in all your exuberance and let's—just be serious with me just for a minute."", ""I want to tell you a couple of stories. One is that yesterday Hillary and Chelsea and I had the privilege of welcoming the Olympic team to the White House. And we're real proud of them. And the day before, we saw the Paralympic team off to Atlanta to do their thing, and it was an incredible event. And of course, we had a chance to go down and speak to our Olympic team and visit the Olympics right before the games began."", ""And so I've been thinking a lot during this whole period and that long night when I stayed up all night after the bomb blew up in the park and we didn't quite know what had happened for a while, what is it that makes people love the Olympics so much, besides the fact that we all love sports? And I think that there are two or three things that make us love it even if we don't like sports so much. You know, we had 77,000 people who saw the women's soccer final. I mean, people really got into this."", ""Now, what is it that we like about it? Well, first of all, you've got people from 197 different countries, and they're all getting along for a change. They're all getting along for a change. Right before I went to the dining hall, the North Korean and South Korean teams had sat at adjoining tables and had talked. I've been trying to get them to talk for 3 1/2 years with no luck. [Laughter]"", ""Secondly, they work the way we think the world ought to work. I mean, there's a set of rules and people follow them. And as long as you're following rules, the other people all respect you, even if you're different from them. And you can't win any medals if you sneak into your opponent's room at night and break his legs or if you stand up at a microphone like this and talk about what a terrible person your opponent is, how they're no good and corrupt and dishonest. You've just got to reach down deep inside and do your best, and everybody gets a chance, but nobody gets a guarantee. And most people don't win medals, but everybody is better off when it's all over. And we all feel good."", 'And in America we especially feel good because there were 197 different nations represented; there are representatives from 150 of those different countries in Los Angeles County tonight as we speak. So we identify with that, and we like it.', ""Now, I'll tell you a second story. I was up in Salinas today, and we were celebrating this remarkable effort they've made with all their community organizations to reach out to all the children in trouble and break this epidemic of gangs they have there and dramatically lower the murder rate among young people. And I went there to celebrate what they've done and also to point out that we announced today that for the first time in 7 long years the crime rate is going down among people under 18— for the first time in 7 years."", 'But it turns out that there was a gold medal winner from Salinas who was a member of our 4 by 400 relay team, a very handsome young man who showed up and got a bigger hand than the President did. It was terrific. And he has a twin brother who came within less than a second of making the Olympic team himself. And it turns out that at one point when these kids were very young they were so poor they were living in a car. But the fellow has an Olympic Gold Medal, an American dream story.', 'Now, what\'s all that got to do with this election? This election, in my opinion, is about what this country is going to look like when we start the new century and the new millennium and, for those of you young people who are in the Saxophone Club, what it\'s going to look like when you\'re my age and you have children. And what I want it to look like is a country where everybody, wherever they start out in life, no matter how poor they are, what their race is, what their station in life is, has a chance to live out their dreams if they\'re willing to be responsible and work for it. I want this to be a country where we relish our diversity, where we celebrate our differences and say, ""We\'re not bound by any race or region or creed. We\'re bound by the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence. If you\'ll sign onto that, you\'re fine by me, and we like it.""', ""And I want this to be a country that stands up for peace and freedom around the world and tells people that it's wrong to have a situation you've got in Bosnia, Burundi, the Middle East, or Ireland or anyplace where people are killed or persecuted because they're different from somebody else, from religion or race or ethnicity."", ""And if we do that, the next century is going to be the greatest era of human possibility that has ever existed. There are children in school today that within 10 years will be doing jobs that have not been invented yet, that have not been imagined yet. And more people will have more chances to live out their dreams than ever before. That's what I'm working for."", ""I was so elated yesterday that I got to participate in a comment about our space scientists discovering this piece of meteorite from Mars that took 16 million years to get here and has been hanging around in Antarctica for Lord knows how many thousands of years but seems to have evidence of a fossilized micro-organism—incredible thing. But whether it's—whatever pans out of it, what it shows is that there is a magnificent world out there of things we still don't know. And the explosion of knowledge and technology, if we can make sure everybody has a fair chance and if we can learn to live together amidst all our differences and if we can keep moving the world forward in a more peaceful way, it's going to be an incredible time out there."", ""Now, that is what this election is all about. And I want you to make just three simple arguments to people in the next 88 days. Number one, take President Reagan's test: Are we better off than we were 4 years ago? Well, if the test is the first time the deficit has gone down in all 4 years of a President's term since the 1840's, 10 million more jobs, 4.4 million more homeowners, 10 million people refinance their mortgages, a record number of new small businesses, a record number of new businesses owned by women and minorities—if that's the test—record exports—we're better off than we were. If the test is 4 years in a row of a declining crime rate, 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers that don't have handguns because of the Brady bill, then we're better off. If the test is 12 million Americans who got to take some time off from work when there was a baby born or a sick parent without losing their job, we're better off. If the test is no nuclear missiles pointed at the American people for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age, we're better off. So are we better off? Yes, we are."", ""Second question: What is the alternative? [Laughter] The answer is, you don't have to guess; you know what they will do, too. They've already done it once; I just vetoed it the first time. And I don't believe we can become a greater, stronger nation by saying we're going to balance the budget and using that as an excuse to wreck our ability to protect the environment for future generations or cutting back on education at a time when we need to be spending more for education—we ought to make sure that nobody who needs to go is ever deprived of the right to go to college, and everybody ought to get 2 more years of education—or running away from our obligations to provide health care to poor children and pregnant women and families with someone in it with a disability or seniors."", ""So there's a big difference here in what we think our obligations are. I believe the role of Government is not to be a bureaucratic pain in the neck. We have reduced the size of Government. We have put it on the side of creating jobs and promoting the economy. But I believe this: I think we have an obligation to protect the environment, to hold people together, and to give people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives. That is what we have to be doing, and that's what I'm committed to."", ""And the last thing I want to say to you is it's a big, bright world out there, but it matters what decisions people make. Don't let anybody tell you this is an election without consequences. This is an election of massive consequence in every single policy area you can think of."", ""You know, we've got 1.3 million fewer people on welfare than we had 4 years ago. We've got 1 1/2 million fewer people on food stamps. I'm all for looking for new and innovative ways to move people from welfare to work. That's why I signed that welfare bill. But it was wrong of the Congress to deny any access to benefits to legal immigrants who work here and pay taxes and through no fault of their own get in trouble. You know, you think about it Monday when you go to work. How many people come here and they work hard and they pay their taxes and through no fault of their own they get in a car wreck or they develop a serious illness. And this Congress wants to say to people they shouldn't even be entitled to a little help even if they've been paying their taxes, even if they've been in the military, legal immigrants that join the military."", ""Don't let this election become an excuse to divide us from anybody who is here lawfully, obeying the law, paying their taxes, doing their part; we ought to go and grow together. We shouldn't be divided on this. Don't do that."", ""If you want to know what we're going to do in the next 4 years, I'll tell you what we're going to do. We've gotten our house in order in the first 4 years. In the second 4 years, we're going to be dedicated to giving every single American the chance to participate in the economy that is emerging, to participate in the society that is emerging, and to know that we can grow the economy and preserve the environment and to know that we can be fair to our children and our parents and still have enough left for ourselves. We, in short, are going to go forward together. We are not going to be divided. And that is the central decision facing the American people."", ""There is too much out there for all of us if we'll just keep our heads on straight, listen to our heart, and say we're going to do it together. That's the spirit that we celebrated in the Olympics, and we need to make American life more that way."", 'Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you.']"

We need to be at the airport because we\'re going to have to shake hands with a few people who will be there before we leave""—a few thousand people, or maybe not even a few thousand people, several thousand people. I thank you all for coming, very much.', 'Hillary and Chelsea and I have had a wonderful time with Al and Tipper and Karenna and Sarah and Albert. We did go out and work on the church rebuilding today to give us something to do to remind ourselves that, as the Scripture says, ""To those to whom much is given, much is expected."" And all of us have a responsibility now as Americans to say we don\'t want our country to be like other countries where people fight with each other because of their differences over race or religion or ethnic group or tribal groups. There\'s too much of that in the world. America is going in the other direction. We\'re going to draw strength from our differences and our shared values, and one of those is the freedom of religion, and we respect that, and we\'re going to keep fighting for it all the way.', ""Let me also tell you that I am very grateful to the State of Tennessee for being so good to me and to our administration. I thank Governor McWherter and Congressman Tanner and Mr. Purcell, all the others that are here, Lois DeBerry, the other leaders of the legislature and local government, people that have been involved in our campaigns. But I cannot thank you enough for the gift of friendship and service that Al and Tipper Gore have been to the United States while I've been President. You have no idea, even in Tennessee, how much difference they've made for America and for the future."", ""There are many things I could say, but just one thing I'd like to emphasize: Every year the Gores have come back to Nashville to have a family conference, to try to stand up for the things that I've cared about a long time and that Hillary has worked for for more than 25 years. And out of those family conferences have come some very impressive things. We now have a family and medical leave law that 12 million American families have been able to take advantage of, to take a little time off from work without losing their job when there's a baby born or a sick parent, and that's a good thing. And we want to build on it."", ""We now have a law which says that we're going to put a V-chip in new televisions so that parents can help to control the programming their children see and now an agreement to 3 more hours of quality educational television for our children on the networks of America. And I thank them for that."", 'The other thing I\'d like to say is back in the election in 1992, Al Gore used to give a little speech. I don\'t know if you remember it, but he said, ""The problem in this country is that everything that ought to be up is down, and everything that ought to be down is up."" Do you remember when he said that? America was laughing with him and rocking with him. But I\'ll tell you something, he\'s got to change his speech this time, because everything that ought to be down is down, and the things that ought to be up are up.', ""And I just want to tell you that for all of you who have given us a chance to serve, you should feel that you were a part of putting in place a strategy that has cut the deficit by 60 percent, that has given us record exports, that has continued to invest in education, in technology, and the future, that has brought this deficit down, and that will balance the budget without destroying our commitments to our senior citizens, to our children, to families with disabilities through Medicare and Medicaid and without requiring cuts in education and protecting the environment. We are going to go into a future with a strong economy, where there are more good jobs and where we're growing together in the 21st century because of the policies that you have supported."", ""And I just want to ask you in the weeks and months ahead to go out and be a good citizen, talk to your friends and neighbors and ask them, what do you want America to look like when we reach the 21st century—it's just 4 years away—what do you want America to look like when your children are your age? It's not that far away. We've got to build an America where every single solitary person, every boy and girl, without regard to their race, their income, their station in life, has a chance to live out their dreams. We've got to build an America strong enough to protect ourselves and to lead the world for peace and freedom. And as we saw at those churches today—one white, one black, both burned and brought together—we have got to build an America where we're coming together, not being driven apart the way so many other countries are. That's the way to go into the future, and that's what we're going to do."", 'Thank you, God bless you, and thank you for a happy birthday. Thank you.']"

I want to say a special word of thanks to the State of West Virginia for the Chief of Staff to the Secretary of the Treasury, Sylvia Matthews, from Hinton, West Virginia, who is here with me today, one of the brightest and best people in our administration. And I would like to say a special word of gratitude to one woman who is here, Emma Williams. She is the mother of Bill Morton, who was the special assistant to Secretary Ron Brown. And Bill was killed on that plane with Ron, serving our country, helping to grow our economy, standing up for America, and I'll always remember and love him for it. Thank you, Emma Williams, for being here today."", ""And finally, thank you, Marilyn Milne. Your story, your spirit, that is what we have been fighting for for the last 4 years, more stories like this, people who are down but not out, people who give other people a chance to make something of their lives. And that's what our enterprise community initiative did, working with your mayor here, working with your city council, working with the local business people when you lost that factory. That is the kind of initiative we need to move this country forward. We've got to turn our country around economically, person by person, family by family, town by town. That is what I have tried to do to let enterprise take root in every community in America, every one. More Marilyn Milnes, that's what this election is all about."", 'My fellow Americans, 4 years ago I came to you in West Virginia and told you that West Virginia was a lot like my home State of Arkansas. I told you that I believed we were on the verge of the greatest age of possibility in American history, where more of our people would have more chances to live their dreams than ever before but only, only if we found a way to meet the challenges of the 21st century and preserve our timeless values.', 'It was a hard message to deliver then. We had high unemployment, stagnant job growth, wages were leveled or going down for many people, the crime rate was going up. We had a host of social problems that were unaddressed. Our country seemed to be more divided by harsh political rhetoric and just sort of drifting into the future. But I knew that we could turn this around.', ""And I come here to say to you, I'm on my way to Chicago. And I'm going on a train because I want to see the people like you that I've been working for and fighting for for 4 years and because I want America to see people like Marilyn Milne who are the product of our efforts for the last 4 years and because I want America to know we are on the right track in this country and we're going forward, we're not turning back."", ""There are a lot of people in West Virginia who embody the America I want to see: Dorothy Slack, 82 years old, who's given 1,300 hours to the Ronald McDonald House; Richard Lowe, who threw the javelin in the Special Olympics; Ocie Lockhart, of only one of 716 athletes of the United States to go to the 1997 Special Olympics in Canada; all the people of Marshall University who bring health care and preventive care to isolated towns and villages of this region. It does take a village to raise a child, help a family, build a community, and lift the country, and you're doing it in West Virginia."", ""In the year 2000, when we stand at the dawn of a new century, my vision today is what it was 4 years ago: I want the American dream of opportunity for all alive for everybody who's responsible enough to work for it. I want this country coming together, not drifting apart. Our diversity is a strength, not a weakness. We ought to walk arm in arm, hand in hand, into the future together."", 'And I am determined that we will still be the strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity in the world. This is still a dangerous world, still a world with untapped opportunities, and America needs to lead the way into the new future we want for the world we want our children to live in.', ""Now, folks, you've heard a lot of this, but I just want you to remember it. I want to tell you very briefly what we've done, remind you very briefly of what we wouldn't let be done, and talk just a little bit about what we're going to do for the next 4 years. That's mostly what I want to do in Chicago. But I want you to be the vote and the voice and the steps of our moving America forward. Just think of this—you heard about the 10 million new jobs; that's a lot of people. The 10 million new jobs came because, first, we decided we would cut the deficit in half to get interest rates down so people could invest in America again and afford to borrow money for businesses and homes. That's what we had to do."", ""This is the first time that the deficit has gone down all 4 years in a President's term since the 1840's, before the Civil War. Ask our friends what they say about that. And my opponent and the Speaker of the House led the fight against that move. They said it would wreck the economy and increase the deficit. Well, it produced 10 million jobs and it gave 15 million families a tax cut and it was the right thing to do. It is moving us forward. There are almost 4 1/2 million new homeowners, and 10 million Americans have refinanced their home mortgages at lower interest rates because we got those interest rates down. We did the right thing, and they were wrong to oppose it."", ""Because of the health care bill, 25 million Americans have access to health care. Because of the minimum wage bill, 10 million Americans have a rising wage. Another thing in the minimum wage was that it made 90 percent of the small businesses in this country eligible for a tax cut if they invest more in their businesses, and it made it easier for people like Marilyn to get pensions for herself and her employees, and that's very important, too. Twelve million Americans, working Americans, have been able to take a little time off from work without losing their jobs when there's a baby born or a parent sick because of the Family and Medical Leave Act. Our opponents led the fight against it. They were wrong. We were right. It's good for America."", ""The crime rate has come down for 4 years in a row. We are midway through putting those 100,000 police on the street. There are 200 more in West Virginia alone. We have to finish the job. Our opponents last year tried to take back that commitment to 100,000 police. They're trying to restrict it today. I said no. Your Congressman said no. We want people safe on our streets, and we know the policemen will do the job. Help us keep that commitment to America; help us stay after it."", ""We have supported policies that made the air cleaner for 50 million Americans. We cleaned up more toxic waste dumps in 3 years than they did in 12. We defended our country's national parks. We are moving this country in the right direction. We expanded the college loan program so all these students at Marshall and other places could have access to lower cost loans with better repayment terms. And we created a national service program so children could earn their way through college by doing community service. We're moving in the right direction. We're on that right track."", 'And unemployment in West Virginia is 4 points lower than it was 4 years ago. If we keep going at one point a year, it will be 4 percent by the year 2000. I\'d like to do it, if you\'ll help me. Let\'s just keep going. I want you to remember that. When people say, ""Why should we support Bill Clinton and Al Gore,"" tell them what I told you and ask them what their answer is and ask them why they fought it. And I want you to remember that in the pivotal moment of 1995, when they said to Bill Clinton and Al Gore and Jay Rockefeller and Robert Byrd and Bob Wise and Nick Rahall, ""If you don\'t take our budget, if you don\'t walk away from the commitment of health care to the elderly in nursing homes, to families with people with disabilities in them, to the poorest children in this country, if you don\'t walk away from the commitment to invest in the environment and the education of our children and our future, we\'re going to shut the Government down,"" we said, ""Have at it. We don\'t stand for blackmail; we stand up for America.""', 'Now, the most important thing is, shall we keep going on the right track or turn around? Would you take a U-turn if you were going in the right direction?', 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. In the next 4 years, we've got to build on the health care work. We have to make it possible for people who are unemployed to keep their health insurance for at least 6 months when they're unemployed. Their families shouldn't be put on the street without a doctor just because people lose their jobs."", 'We have to make the next 2 years of education, the first 2 years of college, just as universal in the next 4 years as a high school education is today, with a tax credit for those 2 years and a tax deduction for all college tuition up to $10,000 a year.', ""And we ought to have the right kind of tax cut. The right kind of tax cut is one that's targeted to people who need it, focused on building strong families and educating people so that they'll be more productive, they'll grow the economy, they'll be stronger, and is paid for in a balanced budget. That's what our tax cut does. Give people tax breaks to go to college, give people tax reductions if they have young children, give people an expanded IRA that they can withdraw from for a first time or health care or education needs, but don't give people a big tax cut that costs over $500 billion that will blow a big hole in the deficit, raise interest rates, raise your mortgage rates, your credit card payments, your car payments, and require even worse cuts than the ones we vetoed last year. That's the wrong way. No U-turn. Stay on the right track. Go forward into the future. That's the right way."", ""I have said a thousand times, but I'll say one more time, I know we still have problems. There are still too many people who want work who don't have it. We've got to give all those people that we're saying—on welfare—there's no more guaranteed check anymore—we've got to make a lot more Marilyn Milnes because they're entitled to work if we're going to cut them off a check for their kids. We've got to give them the jobs. We've got to create the jobs."", ""I know there are still people who have worked hard and don't have a pay raise. And we've got to give those folks the education they need and challenge their employers to be responsible when they make a profit to share their income with their employees so we can go forward and grow together. I know that. But I will say again, as I have said over and over and over again since 1991, if we want a country where the American dream is alive for everybody who will work for it, if we want a country where people are coming together, not being divided, if we want a country that is leading the world for peace and freedom and prosperity, we've got to have opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and a sense of community."", 'We are all in this fight for the future together. I don\'t want to be told, ""You\'re on your own."" I don\'t want to look at people and say, ""You\'re on your own."" I believe we\'re stronger when we join hands and march into that future together on the right track, the right track. Will you help us? Will you stay with us? Will you fight for victory? Will we win? [Applause] I know we will.', 'Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you.']"

The deficit is 60 percent lower than it was when I took office; it's gone down 4 years in a row, 4 years in a row, for the first time—listen to this—the deficit has gone down 4 years in a row for the first time since before the Civil War, in the 1840's. A President has done that, thanks to Wendell Ford and thanks to Mike Ward.

In just the last week, over strong opposition, we finally got an increase in the minimum wage for 10 million hard-working Americans. And that bill included tax relief for 90 percent of the small businesses in this country if they invest more in their business. And it made it easier for people in small businesses to take out retirement plans for themselves and their employees. It was a wonderful bill. It gave a $5,000 tax credit to any American family that will adopt a child. It removed the barriers to cross-racial adoption. That minimum wage bill was prowork, pro-business, pro-family, pro-America. I'm proud we fought for it, and I'm proud we won it."", ""We signed the Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform bill that says, if you lose your job or somebody in your family gets sick, you can't have your health insurance taken away from you anymore. You can't be denied the right to health insurance.

In 1993 every single solitary Republican in the Congress voted against our economic reform plan. They said it would increase the deficit. They said it would cripple the economy.

In honor of this fine, fine man that introduced me, I want you to help me finish our commitment to putting 100,000 police on the street. You know, it wasn't so very long ago when it was rare for me to meet anyone—anyone—who thought we could lower the crime rate. People just took it for granted that the cities were dangerous and the little towns in the country were about to get that way. People just took it for granted that we were going to have rising crime rates from now on."", ""We have had 4 years with the crime rate going down. And it's not a mystery: more police in community policing, more police officers in our safe and drug-free schools program in the school, telling these kids that drugs are dangerous; we don't care what you hear, what you see in the movies, what you hear anywhere else, they are dangerous. They're not just illegal; they will kill you."", ""We have taken those assault weapons off the street, and we've passed the Brady bill.

They voted against the 100,000 police program, and then they tried to get rid of it. And they're still trying to do away with it. I tell you, this is crazy. If the crime rate's going down, we need to put more police officers on the street, not back up and undo what we've done to get it down. It's not low enough yet.

I've got a lot of other ideas about what to do in the next 4 years. But let's look at the big picture. We've got to keep this economy going until everybody has a chance to benefit from it."", ""Now, we've proved that we can get the deficit down and grow the economy. I told you this would produce 8 million jobs; it produced 10. I told you we'd cut the deficit in half; we cut it by more than 60 percent.

I'm for all that. We can afford that kind of tax cut. And it'd be worth a lot to middle class, hard-working families. But we cannot afford to go right back around and take a U-turn and make the same mistake we made before. And that's what the other side is proposing, a tax cut 5 times as big as mine that they don't know how they're going to pay for. And you know what will happen; it will blow a hole in the deficit. That means higher interest rates. That means whatever you get in the tax cut, you'll pay right back in your mortgage payment, your car payment, your credit card payment. It also means even bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment than I vetoed when they shut the Government down. I didn't put up with it before; I won't put up with it again. It is not the right thing for America."", ""Now, you look at that train there. If you were on that train going to your destination, which is the 21st century, the last thing in the wide world you'd want to do is to make a U-turn just because you heard a pretty song somewhere along the way. [Laughter] That's a pretty song, that big old tax cut. But it's like that contract. Do you remember their contract? They never did say word one about it in San Diego, did they? I didn't watch it, but somebody told me they listened intently for 4 days for their record, and they never talked about their record and their contract. Do you remember, it sounded so pretty in 1994? And then the consequences came in in '95 and '96. And thank goodness for America, Wendell Ford and his friends were there to stand up and say no. But if you give them the White House and the Congress, there won't be anybody to say no. And they'll get to do their U-turn, and it will sound pretty. And then you'll have to deal with the consequences: high interest rates, slow growth, and exploding debt."", ""Let me just tell you one other thing. The budget of the United States of America would be in surplus today—this day—if it were not for the interest we're paying on the debt run up in the 12 years before I took office when they quadrupled the debt with all those tax cut promises. You wouldn't yourself, in this beautiful town of Ashland—you wouldn't yourself go down to the local bank and borrow money to give yourself a tax cut, would you? You wouldn't do it. Why would you hire somebody else to do something you wouldn't do for yourself?We cannot blow up the debt. We can give you a tax cut. It will help you raise your kids. It will help you get an education. It will help you with health care and homebuying. And we can afford it and still balance the budget and protect our priorities and build on the future."", 'And the last thing I want to say is this: All this comes down to whether we\'re going to meet our challenges and protect our values, whether you believe we can create opportunity and have more responsibility, and whether we can go forward together, or whether you\'re better off with somebody telling you, ""The Government\'s the problem. It\'s not yours. You\'re on your own. Have a nice life. Here\'s a little money.""', ""I believe you know from your life in this great, grassroots, God-fearing American community that we are all in this together, we had better lock arms and go forward together, and that when America is together and we're positive and we act like this fine police officer and local government official and we act like that wonderful young girl in her Olympic championship, America always wins. Let's stay on the right track for the 21st century."", 'God bless you.']"
30,William J. Clinton ,"August 25, 1996","['The President. Thank you very, very much. Thank you.', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. It's great to be back in Chillicothe. The last time I was here it was 3 degrees, and we still went running in the park. And I'm amazed I can move. But I survived it, and I'm glad to be back. It's a wonderful place. [Applause] Thank you."", 'Thank you, Senator John Glenn, for your heroic career, your magnificent service to Ohio and to the United States. Thank you for your leadership in defense and foreign policy and in helping Al Gore and me to give this country the smallest Federal Government in 30 years and the most efficient since John Kennedy was President of the United States.', 'And thank you, Ted Strickland. I want to thank you for a couple of things. I want to thank you for coming to me personally and riding with me on Air Force One and pleading with me to help you keep open the gaseous plant in Portsmouth. I want to thank you for helping work with me on the enterprise community designation for Portsmouth. I want to thank you for having the courage—and I think it probably cost you your seat in \'94—to vote for that economic plan when our friends in the opposition said it was tax-and-spend. And of course, it wasn\'t. We cut taxes for 15 million of the hardest working Americans. We made 90 percent of the small business in this country eligible for a tax cut. But we did cut the deficit. And our friends in the opposition said, ""Give us the Congress. Bill Clinton\'s plan will bankrupt the country, increase the deficit, cost us jobs."" Well, the verdict is in, friends. Four years later, we have 10 million more jobs, the deficit has gone down 4 years in a row under the same administration for the first time since before the Civil War. Ted Strickland was right, and his opponent was wrong.', 'I want to thank you for voting for the family and medical leave law. Twelve million working Americans have been able to take some time off in the last 3 1/2 years when there was a baby born or a parent sick without losing their jobs. And we just got a bipartisan study that said 90 percent of the businesses said it was no problem.', ""We have grown jobs faster in this economy in the last 4 years than, as Senator Glenn said, any Republican administration since the 1920's. And we still passed the family and medical leave law so people could succeed at home and at work. Thank you, Ted Strickland. You were right, and they were wrong."", ""And let me say one other thing. After Ted left the Congress, they had a chance to implement their Contract With America. Don't you forget that either, folks. I'll have more to say about that in a minute. This man was a good Congressman. He did you proud. He's a good human being. He's a good person. And he ought to be given a chance to represent this place again."", ""Let me also say—I brought some people with me: your State treasurer and our national Treasurer, Mary Ellen Withrow, thank you for coming; my good friend and a former official in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, whose farm I visited in Ohio in 1992, Gene Branstool; our nominee for the Senate last year, Joel Hyatt. And we have several members of the Ohio Legislature and officials of the party, State Representatives Mike Shoemaker and Bill Ogg. I know we have County Auditor Steve Neal; State Senator Jan Michael Long. Somebody told me that in this crowd the lady who gave me a handcrafted quilt last time was here, Leona Long. Are you here? Thank you very much if you're here. There you are. God bless you. Thank you. And I told you I'd save those quilts, and I've still got yours. [Laughter] And a young woman who introduced me at the last town meeting, Melissa Hagen, I think she's here, too, somewhere. Thank you, Melissa, if you're here. There you are back there. Thank you. I'd like to thank all the bands that were here."", ""I'd like to say that my daughter, Chelsea, and I are delighted to be here. Hillary started this train trip with us, but you know, she's from Chicago so she had to fly home to make sure everything was all right when we got there. The Vice President said to tell you hello, and he's in Chicago as well.And I know that this is not the most direct route to Chicago, but I've been in Huntington, West Virginia, and Ashland, Kentucky, today, and now I'm in Chillicothe, and I've been in all kind of places along the way saying hello to people because I wanted to go to the convention to accept the nomination of my party for another term as President by seeing the people that I ran for President to represent. And I wanted you to see me on this train because I wanted you to remember we're not only on the right track to Chicago, we're on the right track to the 21st century, and we need to stay on the right track."", ""In 1992 when I came here the country had high unemployment, slow job growth, stagnant wages, rising crime. We weren't facing up to our challenges; we were drifting apart. But I said then and I'll say again tonight, I think our best days are ahead. I think this new world we are moving into offers people more chances to live their dreams than any period in human history."", ""The children in this audience tonight, within a decade, will be doing jobs that have not been invented yet. All we have to do is to meet our challenges and protect our values. All we have to do is to say, opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and we're going forward together. We're not going to be divided anymore. We're going forward together as an American community."", ""And you know what? It is working. Look what we did just last week. We raised the minimum wage for 10 million Americans. In the same bill, in the very same bill we made 90 percent of the small businesses in this country eligible for another tax cut if they invest more in their business. We made it easier for people in small businesses to take out pensions and to keep those pensions when they changed jobs. That's terribly important. We made it easier for parents to adopt and gave them a $5,000 tax credit if they would adopt a child that needs a home, and removed the barriers to cross-racial adoption because we want a pro-family country that takes care of every child and finds a home for every child."", ""I signed a bill to end welfare as we know it but not to take from poor children their medical care, their nutrition, their help if they're disabled, but to say we are going to change this system from one that fosters dependence to one that fosters independence. We want people who are poor to have the same chance everybody else does to succeed at home and at work. And that is my goal, and I want to say more about that. It's terribly important."", 'And maybe most important of all—you know, another thing Ted Strickland did was try to help us get some work done on health care reform.', ""And they spent a lot of money, the people who didn't want any changes, telling everybody how terrible our plans were and what a big Government plan it was, and never mind that all the experts said it was actually a modest, moderate, progressive plan to provide coverage and keep the private sector in our health system."", ""But we didn't succeed in '94, and a lot of the Democrats paid the price. But because of the work we did, last week I signed a bill that does about 30 percent of what we tried to do, and a big first step, the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill. It says you cannot lose your health insurance just because somebody in your family has been sick or if you change jobs. You cannot do it anymore. You have a right to health insurance. Twenty-five million Americans—think of it—25 million Americans will have a chance now to get or keep their health insurance. That's a lot of children sleeping better at night. That's a lot of parents feeling more secure."", ""And so, Ted Strickland, I'm sorry you weren't there to vote for it, but your vote counted because you were there first, and we appreciate you, sir, for sticking up for it. It was the right thing to do."", ""And so I say to you, my friends, we're on the right track. Unemployment is down. There is more opportunity. We've got not only 10 million new jobs, 4 1/2 million new homeowners, 10 million homeowners that have refinanced their homes at lower interest rates. The unemployment rate in Ohio is down to 4.9 percent."", ""Now, what do we got to do now? We have to keep this economic recovery going until everyone can participate. That means balance the budget, but don't gut Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment to do it. We can do it without doing that. We can invest in our future and still do it."", 'What else does it mean? It means that we have to increase the educational level of the people of this country. You heard Cindy talking about her education. I want to make by the year 2000, 2 years of college after high school as universal as a high school education is today. I want it to be there for everybody. And so I have proposed to give working families in America a $10,000 tax deduction for the cost of college tuition for any kind of tuition after high school and a $1,500 refundable tax credit for the cost of the first 2 years of community college in every State in the country. That is what we ought to do.', 'I want us to have more responsibility in this country. You know, there are 1.3 million fewer people on the welfare rolls than there were when I became President. Child support collections are 40 percent higher, and the crime rate has gone down for 4 years in a row. In 1994, our friends in the opposition said, ""Oh, look what the President did. They\'re going to take your gun away from you."" Guess what? Everybody in Ohio is still hunting with the same gun they had when they said that. It wasn\'t true then. And if you believed them when they misled you, you need to pay them back this time and tell them you don\'t appreciate being misled. You\'ve still got your gun, but the country is safer. I\'ll tell you who doesn\'t have guns: 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers don\'t have guns because of the Brady bill.', 'But we\'ve got more to do if we want real responsibility. We\'ve got to finish the work of putting 100,000 police officers on our street. We\'ve got hundreds here in Ohio. They\'re bringing the crime rate down. We also have to recognize in this welfare reform bill I signed, folks, that\'s the beginning, not the end. It\'s all very well to say to people after a certain time, ""We\'re going to cut you off welfare and make you go to work""; there has to be work to find. And I am going to the convention to tell the American people what I propose to do to help find jobs to move people from welfare to work and help jobs for other people who are not yet there.', ""We must not let this welfare reform be some cruel budget-cutting hoax that throws poor children in the street. They're our children, too. What we want is for their parents to go to work, to be able to go to work, to live like the rest of America, to come and be part of our big family and go forward together. That's what we all want."", ""Finally, let me just say this: I want us to go forward together, together with people around the world who agree with us, together with people here at home who may be of a different religion or a different color but who share our convictions and our values. That means we've got to do more to work together to build strong families; that's what the family leave law was about. We've got to do more to work together to build a clean environment. Fifty million Americans are breathing cleaner air now than they were 4 years ago. We've got safer meat standards, safer standards against dangerous pesticides, all supported by the agricultural community. We've cleaned up more toxic dumps in 3 years than they did in 12. We're moving in the right direction."", 'And finally, I want Americans who need it to have a tax cut, but I want it to be a tax cut we can afford, that will do some good for individuals, for families, and for our country. I proposed a targeted tax cut. I already told you about the education cuts, a $500-credit for children under 13, an expanded IRA for people with incomes phasing up to $100,000 that you can put into and then save and withdraw from for education, to buy that first home, for health care costs. Those are the kind of tax cuts that will help ordinary American families. We can afford those.', ""Now, as you heard from our friends in San Diego, my respectable opponents, they offer you one that's 5 times as big. So why shouldn't you go for them? Well, let me ask you this. Would you wake up tomorrow morning—well, you wouldn't tomorrow morning, I guess, but—yes, you would, it's Monday—would you wake up tomorrow morning, go to the bank, and borrow money to give yourself a tax cut? Well, then why would you hire somebody to do it? [Laughter] Think about that. You think about it."", ""Our friends in the Republican Party last year said—not me, they said—they said, and they were right, that if we're on a balanced budget plan, interest rates will be 2 percent lower than if we're not. You just figure it out. If your home mortgage, your car payment, your credit card payments go up 2 percent, all your tax cut will go out the window paying higher interest rates. And we'll have slower job growth. And we won't be putting more people to work. And the economy won't be growing."", ""But if we have a targeted, disciplined tax cut that creates more people like this fine lady who introduced me, if we have more people like her who feel like they can write the President six times until he shows up—[laughter]—who are proud to be working to improve their education while they're raising children, then there'll be a lot more Cindy Bakers in this country."", ""I can give you a tax cut that we can afford that will balance the budget, keep the economy growing, educate our children, educate their parents, allow us to save for health care and homebuying, and we can balance the budget. That's the tax cut we need going forward on that track into the future, not backward. We tried it the other way, and it did not work."", ""So I want you to help me give that message. We're better off than we were 4 years ago. We've got health care reform, minimum wage reform, 10 million more jobs, a stronger economy, a crime bill that's working to bring down the crime rate. We're in the middle of welfare reform, and we're doing the right things. We're bringing the American people together, not dividing them."", ""But we're only halfway home. We've got a lot to do. We have gotten the country going in the right track. In the next 4 years, we need to make sure that every single American who's responsible enough to work for it has a chance to benefit and be rewarded and build a strong career, a strong life, a strong family, a strong community, and a strong nation. That is my commitment to you. That's what the next 4 years are about. That's why I need your help."", ""Will you help? Will you help? Will you help me? [Applause] Every day, every way, stay with me on to Chicago, on to November. We have to have Ohio. I'm glad to be back. Bring me home again."", 'God bless you, and thank you.']"
31,William J. Clinton ,"August 26, 1996","[""The President. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm glad to see all of you. I thank you for that wonderful introduction. I am delighted to be here. Thank you, Chief Jackson, for being here and for the work you do every day. Thank you, Sheriff Karnes, for being here, for what you do as well. And I'm very grateful to you."", 'Thank you, Senator Glenn——', '[At this point, there was a disturbance in the audience.]', ""The President. Wait, wait, wait. No, wait a minute. Okay, wait, wait, wait. I believe in the first amendment. Now you've had your say, may I have mine? [Applause] Thank you, thank you very much. We'll talk about the record now."", '[The disturbance continued.]', ""The President. You've got to feel sorry for these people. They don't want you to know my record; that's why they have to shout. They'd be in a world of hurt if the American people— [applause]—you know, if the American people find out the truth. They don't have a chance, and they have to try to shout it down. I don't blame them. You got to feel sorry for—[Applause]."", ""Now, let me say I am delighted to be joined here with Senator John Glenn. He talked about how we'd reduced the Government. He didn't say that he deserves a lot of the credit for it. Our friends on the other side talked a lot— like today, you see, they're good at that—they talked a lot about the Government and how it was too big and how terrible it was, you know. But it just got bigger. They didn't do anything about it."", 'We reduced the size of it. You have the smallest Federal Government since John Kennedy was President. You have the smallest Federal Government as a percentage of our work force since Franklin Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933, before the New Deal.', ""But the reason you haven't heard about it is we didn't throw those people in the street. Of the 250,000 people smaller the Federal Government is, fewer than 1,800 were involuntarily separated. I'm proud of that. We treated those people with dignity and helped them to go on to other lives and said, thank you for what you did for your country."", ""And you haven't heard about it because we continue to do the good work of America, because we have a strong and effective Government. We don't have a weak Government; it's just leaner and more effective. And that's a big part—in big part the result of the efforts and the leadership of John Glenn, who saved hundreds of millions of dollars in defense procurement and did so many other things for this country that he will never get adequate credit for. But the people of Ohio should know what he has done."", 'I also want to thank a daughter of Ohio, your State treasurer who\'s now my national Treasurer, Mary Ellen Withrow, who\'s here with me today. I thank her. I thank my friend Gene Branstool. I think he\'s back here with us today. I went to his farm, as John Glenn said, and Gene came and served with us in the Department of Agriculture until he decided, like any sane person, that he\'d rather live in Ohio than Washington, DC. [Laughter] I\'ve got my Ohio buckeye that I got in Chillicothe last night. When I was on the train yesterday, I noticed the corn crop, and it looks really pretty. But I told Gene, I said, ""It\'s not as high as it was in 1992."" He said, ""I know, but the prices are a lot higher, and that\'s even better."" [Laughter]', 'So I am delighted to be here with you. I thank Senator Jeff Johnson—State Senator Jeff Johnson—and Franklin County Democratic chair Dennis White for being here and all of you for coming out today. I want to say a special thanks to the students of the police academy and the men and women who graduated from it and the law enforcement officials who are here today. They are here today so that we can express our gratitude to them.', ""One of the proudest moments of my Presidency was to stand with America's police officers and sign, after 7 years of long, hard struggle, the Brady bill. I never thought of public safety as a political issue before. I never thought of it as a Republican issue, when they said they were tough on crime, because I'd been working on it for 20 years. It never occurred to me that—when a person gets mugged, they don't ask if you're a Democrat or a Republican. I thought it was an American issue. And then when we were fighting to pass the Brady bill, I never thought of it as a political issue, even though the NRA had more influence over the other party. There's lots of NRA members in my home State, and half the folks have a hunting or a fishing license or both. But tonight I'm proud to say that the Brady bill, which was named after Ronald Reagan's Press Secretary, Jim Brady, and was pushed by his wife, Sarah Brady—I'm proud to say that at the Democratic Convention in Chicago tonight Sarah Brady will be one of the speakers. It's an American issue to stand up for public safety."", ""You know, we are living in an age of enormous possibility. You read about it all the time; the technological changes are staggering. The children in this audience, a lot of them—a lot of the young people 10 years from now will be doing jobs that have not even been invented yet, jobs that have not even been imagined yet. The pace of change is staggering. And I've been doing everything I could to make sure that we are ready for the 21st century. It starts in just 4 years. I'm taking a train through the heartland of America because I want to see people like you that I've been fighting for and because I want people like you to know that that train is on the right track to the 21st century."", ""We spent a lot of time talking about opportunity, and last week was a good week for opportunity. We raised the minimum wage for 10 million people, 440,000 in Ohio. We made it easier for small-business people and their employees to take out and keep their pension plans, even when they change jobs, and that's very important. We made it easier for families to adopt children, even across racial lines, and gave them a tax credit to do it, and that's very important. We passed the welfare reform law, but we kept guaranteed health care and child care for working women and children, so that when we give people a job they can also take care of their kids. That's what we want for middle class families; it's what we should want for poor families as well."", ""We signed the Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform bill to protect 25 million people, to give them a chance to keep their health insurance when they changed jobs and to say you can't be denied health insurance just because somebody in your family gets sick. That's what insurance is for, people are going to get sick. It was a great thing."", ""Senator Glenn talked about the deficit. Actually, Senator, the last time a President had the deficit go down in all 4 years of his Presidency was before the Civil War, in the 1840's, under John Tyler. It's been a long time since we did that. That's the good news. The bad news is John Tyler was not reelected. [Laughter] But what you ought to know while you're having that laugh is—this is the important thing, not how long ago it was—what you really ought to know is, when you consider the major issues in this election, is that your budget would not only be balanced, there would be a healthy surplus in the Federal budget today if it weren't for the interest we have to pay on the debt that was run up in just the 12 years before I took office. And you all remember what that debt meant and what that interest meant. It meant high interest costs, low investment, slow job growth, nobody getting a raise, homeownership declining because mortgage rates were so high."", ""We cannot afford to blow a hole in this deficit again. We can have a tax cut that's targeted to childrearing, to education, to training of adults, to helping us grow the economy and helping give some income relief to middle class people. But we dare not take one we can't afford, and we don't need to go to the bank and borrow the money. We need to go on and balance this budget, keep the interest rates down, keep homeownership going up, keep business investment going up, keep new jobs going up, keep wages rising. That's what we've got to do."", ""But this whole agenda—when you talk about the opportunity agenda in America, you can get a lot of applause lines, because we've created a lot of opportunity. But America doesn't work without the other half of the bargain, responsibility. Without responsibility, opportunity will not flourish. And unless we are committed to that basic bargain and to the proposition that we have to go forward together across racial lines, across religious lines, across all the lines that divide us—we need to say, as long as we all believe in the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, we show up for work every day, we're going arm in arm into the future. We're going to be one community in America and going arm in arm into the future."", 'Four years ago, I really believed after talking to Americans all over this country that the biggest threat to that and the biggest affront to our sense of responsibility was the rising rate of crime and violence all over America. We put into place a tough strategy based on what was working already at the grassroots level to try to reduce the crime rate, focusing on police, on punishment, on prevention, 100,000 more police on the street, ""three strikes and you\'re out,"" the assault weapons ban, the Brady bill, recreational programs for children after school, keeping the schools open more, helping communities to do that, putting those D.A.R.E. officers in, having a zero-tolerance policy for guns, doing things that would work to help our kids have something to say yes to, not just to say no to. All these things are making a difference.', ""For 2 years I've been telling America we were having a terrible dilemma: the crime rate was going down, but the juvenile crime rate was going up; the drug use rate was going down, but the juvenile drug use rate was going up. Now, we know for 2 years the juvenile murder rate has dropped dramatically, and last year for the first time in a long time, the juvenile crime rate started to go down. I can only hope that means that we can get the juvenile drug use rate down, too. We have to keep working on that. But the last thing we want to do is to take those D.A.R.E. officers out of the school. We ought to do more to provide safe and drugfree schools, not less."", ""What I'd like to talk about today is where we're going from here. I spent a lot of time trying to help schools all over America do things that would save more kids, to do things like have the option to adopt school uniform policies. I've seen it all over California, where it's become the rage, where you've got lower dropout rates, less violence, higher performance, all the kids feel better, not just the poor kids, the middle class kids, but the wealthy kids, too. People like being judged by what's on the inside, not what on the outside. It's helping to promote discipline and values in our schools. Tougher truancy laws are doing the same thing; curfew laws are doing the same thing. We ought to be doing more of that."", ""We also, as the sheriff and the chief said, did take on the gun issue, and a lot of people thought we had lost our minds. And I'll tell you, we did lose a lot of good Congressmen over it. Back in 1994, I remember the other side going around telling everybody in places like Ohio and Arkansas that the Democrats and the President had voted to take your guns away. I didn't know a single deer hunter with an Uzi, not a one. [Laughter] I've been duck hunting since I was a very young fellow, and it wouldn't have bothered me a lick to wait a few days on the Brady bill to have my record checked. I just didn't understand it. But they scared a lot of people. You may know a lot of people they scared. And a lot of people, a lot of good people, a lot of good people gave up their seats in Congress so these people could be safer when they go out to defend you and so you could be safer."", ""So I hope over the next 70 days or so, you'll talk to your friends and neighbors who felt that way and remind them next time hunting season goes out, unless they decided not to, they're still carrying the same weapon they had in 1994. But there are 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers who don't have handguns because of the Brady bill, and we're better off because of it."", ""Now, I want to say briefly today where I think we ought to go from here as Americans. And again, I hope they won't be partisan issues. The Brady bill has plainly worked. It has not imposed undue inconvenience on anybody. It has made our law enforcement officials safer. And it has made our citizens safer. It covers today anyone convicted of a felony."", ""The problem is there is one class of misdemeanors that tend to be particularly violent, where we know there's a potential for future violence, where often there's a plea bargain which goes from a felony to a misdemeanor. And that is the painful area of domestic violence. I believe that the Brady bill should cover anybody with a domestic violence conviction. I don't believe they should be able to buy a handgun. Under the current law, thousands of people who are wife beaters or child abusers, even those who have wielded weapons in their assault but were convicted of misdemeanors, can still buy handguns with potentially deadly consequences."", ""I believe strongly in the right of Americans to own guns. I have used them as a hunter with great joy. But make no mistake, those who threaten the safety of others do not deserve our trust. If you're convicted of a felony, you shouldn't have one. If you're a fugitive from the law, you shouldn't have a gun. If you're stalking or harassing women or children, you shouldn't have a gun. And if you commit an act of violence against your spouse or your child, you shouldn't have a gun."", ""Let me also say, domestic violence is a big threat to law enforcement officers. We're working hard with our new violence against women section and other efforts in the Justice Department to help police officers and prosecutors and judges to understand domestic violence, to recognize it when they see it, to know how to deal with it."", ""This past February, we launched a 24-hour, 7-day, toll-free hotline so women in trouble can find out about emergency help, get shelter, report abuse to the authorities. I never miss a chance to give out the number. It's 1-800-799- SAFE. And about 7,000 people a month call on that hotline. Extending the Brady bill to victims of domestic violence, to protect them, will save more lives. It will also save more law enforcement lives."", ""There are other steps we should take to protect our police officers and our citizens from gun violence. Last summer I sent Congress legislation to ban cop-killer bullets. These bullets are designed to kill police. That's what they do. They're designed to pierce bulletproof vests. If a bullet can slice through a bulletproof vest like a hot knife through butter, it should be against the law. Every major law enforcement official organization supports this bill, and it's time for Congress to support it, too."", 'I want a bill to give prosecutors the power to impose tougher sentences on drug traffickers and gang members who also use a gun when they commit their crimes. We used to have a bill which did that, and the courts said, unless they were using the gun—even if they were carrying the gun in full view—they couldn\'t get extra penalties. That\'s wrong. That\'s wrong. We need to provide protection against people who are peddling drugs or doing other things with a gun designed to terrify people. We need to say, ""If you do that, we\'re going to punish you more harshly.""', ""Again, I want Congress to pass the bill I sent them nearly a year ago to ban guns anywhere near our schools. That is wrong. We used to have a bill on that, too, and the courts overturned it. So I sent them a bill to fix it, and it still hasn't passed. We don't need people wandering around a block from a schoolyard with a gun. We know there are too many kids who've been killed on play yards with guns in this country, and we do not need it."", ""Now, again, there are people who are against banning cop-killer bullets. They say it's just a slippery slope eroding their right to keep and bear arms. I have never seen a deer in a Kevlar vest—[laughter]—never. If somebody can show me a picture of one out there hiding from our hunters, I'll be glad to reassess my position. [Laughter] But until they do, I believe I'll stay with these folks here. I think they're entitled to be safe."", ""And let me just make one final comment. Usually when people like me give speeches like this, we try, and sometimes we're fortunate enough to succeed, to have folks like this behind us, people in uniform, because we honor them, we're proud of them, we identify with them, and we're glad they're doing something we don't do and taking a risk for us. But I think we should never forget that the ultimate beneficiaries of all these efforts to make our streets safer and our schools safer and our homes safer are you. And I want to introduce you to the two people on the stage that I haven't introduced yet. And I want to tell you a story. It's one of the most moving stories of my over 20 years in public life."", ""This man and his son—this is Dimitrious Theofanis and his son, Nick. I'd like to ask them to stand up. [Applause] I want to tell you how I met Dimitrious. In early 1992,1 about 4 1/2 years ago, just before the New Hampshire primary, I had a fundraiser scheduled in a big hotel in New York. And frankly, I was having a tough time. I was dropping in the polls, and all the press had said I was dead and over, history, finished. I was feeling pretty sorry for myself. All I was thinking about was my politics. I'm ashamed to say it, but that's all I was thinking about."", 'And I was walking through this kitchen thinking there wasn\'t even going to be anybody at the fundraiser because everybody said I didn\'t have a chance anymore. And I\'m kind of looking down and just feeling sorry for myself. It was pitiful. [Laughter] And Dimitrious was working in that hotel, in his uniform. And I was walking through the kitchen, and he came up to me and stopped me in the kitchen, and he said, ""Governor,"" he said, ""I want to talk to you a minute. My 10-year-old boy""—his son was 10 then—he says, ""my 10-year-old boy, he studies this election in school, and he says I should vote for you."" He said, ""But if I vote for you, I want you to do something for me."" I said, ""What?"" He said, ""I want you to make my son free."" I said, ""What do you mean?"" He said, ""Well, in the country where I came from we were poor, but we were free. I\'m an immigrant. Here I\'m doing well. I\'m working hard. I have more money, but we\'re not free."" He said, ""Just across the street from our apartment there is a park, but my son can\'t play in it unless I\'m there with him. He has a school only two blocks from our home, but my son can\'t walk there unless I go with him. So if I do what my son wants me to do, I want you to make my boy free.""', ""They made an impression on me that will last for the rest of my life, and they were speaking for all of you. And I wanted you to see them today. They're riding the train with me to Chicago. Thank you, and God bless you."", 'I hope you will support extending the Brady bill. I hope you will support banning cop-killer bullets. I hope you will support tougher penalties for people who deal drugs with guns. And I hope you will support a good, clean law saying nobody has got any business with a gun anywhere near a school. Help us to keep making America free.', 'Thank you, and God bless you.']"
32,William J. Clinton ,"August 26, 1996","['The President. Thank you. Thank you very much.', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you all for coming out. Thank you for being in such a wonderful frame of mind. Thank you for making us feel so welcome. And if you get too hot, we've got some water up here. Raise your hand. We don't want anybody to collapse. We have doctors; we have nurses; we have lots of water."", ""Now, let me say, before I begin I'd like to thank the Arlington High School Band for doing such a great, great job. I'd like to thank the other people whose names I've been given: Ms. Mary Gould, the piano player; the Paragon Barbershop Quartet; Tom Kroske and his band. I'd like to thank Mayor Lynne Orwick of Arlington; Judge Reginald Rowtson; the mayor of Fostoria, Mr. Jim Bailey; and Paul McClain, the candidate for Congress, who spoke earlier, I think. Thank you all for being here. Thank you, Mary Ellen Withrow, for doing a great job as the treasurer of Ohio and the Treasurer of the United States. I'm proud to have you in this administration."", 'I want to thank Senator John Glenn for being here with me on this train trip through the heartland and for his consistent, patriotic leadership for our country and for the people of Ohio in the Senate, to build the economy, to protect our interests around the world, to keep our defense strong, and to lead—lead—our party in the Congress and to help our administration in the most dramatic savings of funds in downsizing of Government in modern American history. We now have the smallest and most efficient Federal Government since John Kennedy was the President of the United States, thanks in no small measure to John Glenn of Ohio.', ""Thank you, David Brown, for your speech and your passion and your commitment to the families and children of this community. Everywhere I go—and I've now been in Huntington, West Virginia; Ashland, Kentucky; Chillicothe and Columbus and a lot of little places along the way, just stopping, saying hello to people— but wherever we've had a rally, I have been introduced by a citizen, a citizen who is either doing something that is consistent with what our administration has pushed for the last 4 years or who represents what I'm trying to have happen in America."", ""I'm sure a lot of you saw that last week our administration became the first one in history to take very strong action to try to limit the marketing, distribution, and sales of tobacco to young people. We are doing our best, but I want to say to you, we cannot do this all by ourselves. We've got to have people in every community in this country determined to keep our kids safe from all the influences that are destructive to them. They're all our children."", ""And with all respect to what was said in the convention in San Diego, Reverend Brown here just got up and gave a speech which validates the title of my wife's book: It does take a village to raise our children, to raise our families, and to build a future."", ""I want to thank my daughter, Chelsea, for coming with me. Hillary has gone home to Chicago to welcome us, so she's not here. But Chelsea is here. We're having a wonderful time on the train ride, and we thank all of you for coming."", ""Audience member. Where's Chelsea?"", ""The President. Where is she? She's right back there. Raise your hand. There she is."", ""Let me tell you that we're on this train, this beautiful train, recreating a trip that many Presidents before me have made, because I wanted to go through America's heartland to Chicago. I wanted to see the people in this country that I've been working for for the last 4 years. I wanted to see your faces, hear your voices, and give you a report on where we are and where we're going. And I wanted you to see that this train is on track not just to Chicago; we're on the right track to the 21st century. And we're going to stay there."", 'Four years ago—just think about 4 years ago—when I came to the people of Ohio, on June 2d, I was officially nominated by the Democratic Party in the primary process when the votes in Ohio were announced. At the Democratic Convention in July in New York, the delegation from Ohio made me the legal nominee of the Democratic Party. And on election night, it was when the votes of Ohio were announced that all the prognosticators said, ""Bill Clinton will be the next President of the United States."" Thank you, Ohio.', 'Now, remember what gave rise to that election. Unemployment was high. Wages were stagnant. Crime was rising. A host of unmet social challenges were plaguing us. And cynicism was on the rise in America.', ""Now look where we are after 4 years. We brought the deficit down with a very tough vote in 1993 that our opponents said would wreck the economy. And what happened? We got interest rates down. We got new jobs going. The deficit has been reduced 60 percent in 4 years. And my fellow Americans, there would be a surplus in your national treasury today but for the interest we still have to pay on the debt that was run up in the 12 years before I took office. Let's don't go back and make that mistake again."", 'And what have we gotten out of it? We have 10 1/4 million new jobs, 4 1/2 million new homeowners. Ten million families have refinanced their homes at lower interest rates. Twelve million American families have taken advantage of the family and medical leave law so they can take a little time off when a baby is born or a parent is sick without losing their jobs. We have record numbers of new small businesses, record numbers of exports. Fifty million Americans are breathing cleaner air. We cleaned up more toxic waste dumps in 3 years than the previous two administrations did in 12.', ""The crime rate has come down for 4 years in a row. We're putting 100,000 police on the street, banning assault weapons. The Brady bill has kept 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers from getting a handgun, and not a single Ohio hunter has lost a rifle, in spite of what the other side told you in the 1994 election."", ""After a decade, real wages are finally starting to rise again for ordinary working people; 15 million American families with the lowest wages who are working full time have gotten a tax cut so we can say in America, nobody works full time and has kids at home and lives in poverty anymore. That's a very important principle that every American of any income ought to share. We want all families to succeed at home and at work. We can have no greater objective than to help people be good parents and successful in making a productive country. College has been made more affordable with lower cost college loans with better repayment terms. We need to do more, but I feel good about where we are compared to where we were 4 years ago."", ""What I want you to think about now is where we still need to go. The main thing we need to say for the next 70 days is, we ought to stay on the right track. We're on the right track; why in the world would we reverse course? What we need to do is to lay plainly before the American people what still needs to be done."", ""First, we know that while the economy has 10 million more jobs, not everybody has fully participated in the benefits of this economic recovery. We know—we know already that the next generation in the 21st century will have more chances to live their dreams than any generation of people who ever lived, that America's best days are before us if we do what it takes to make sure all these children can participate in that future. That's why I say, first of all, we've got to keep the economy going. That means balance the budget, keep the interest rates down, and don't have unnecessary cuts in education, the environment, technology, science, research, Medicare, and Medicaid. Protect our people's obligations."", ""I also say to you that we know that education is more important than ever before. And yes, we've made some strides forward, but we have more to do. We must make sure that every classroom in this country has access to computers, educational programs, trained teachers and that by the year 2000 every single classroom in America, in the smallest rural village, in the poorest inner-city neighborhood, is hooked up to the information superhighway so every child has the same access to information that every other child has."", 'We have to make sure that every American family can afford the education that is critical to our future, not just for the children but for the adults who will be going back to school as well. And I have proposed that by the year 2000 we will make the first 2 years of college or a community college education just as universal in 4 years as a high school education is today by giving American families a $1,500 tax credit for the cost of tuition at their community college, a $10,000 tax deduction for any educational cost after high school.', 'We ought to let people deduct their cost for 4 years for medical school, for graduate school, for whatever. We have a vested interest in having the most educated people in the world, and we need every family to be able to do that, not just those that can afford it.', ""I have proposed making it easier for families to save. Today, you can't take out an IRA if your income is over $40,000. Under our proposal, we'll go up to $100,000 for a couple, in income. And now, under a bill just passed by Congress, if there are two people in the home, they can both put aside $2,000 a year. And under my proposal you'll be able to withdraw from that without any penalty for a college education, to finance a first home, to deal with a health care emergency. Let's save in a way that helps America. Let's have a tax cut we can pay for, balance the budget; that's for children and education."", ""I also know—the Reverend was talking about saving our kids. One of the biggest problems is that a lot of our kids live in families where their parents are working hard and doing the best they can, but they're alone too many hours a day. Our proposal would give a tax cut for people with children under 13 so they can have some more money, $500 a year to pay for child care or help their kids be in some other kind of activity after school. And we also want to give more funds to school districts around the country so they can be open longer hours. If we could keep all the young people in this country involved in positive activities between 3 and 6 o'clock, we'd see a lot of reduction in a lot of our problems. And we need to do that. And I want to do what I can to help."", ""I want to see this become a more responsible country. Yes, the crime rate's gone down for 4 years in a row, but we have to finish the job. We have voted to put 100,000 more police on the street. We've only funded half of them on the schedule we're on. One of the things I intend to do if I am reelected your President is to make sure every single one of those 100,000 police is on the street."", ""Our friends in the other party in Congress disagree with me. They voted against the 100,000 police. They tried to repeal it in the budget I vetoed. Now they're trying to restrict it again. But I'm telling you folks, we can prevent crime and catch criminals if we have more people serving their communities out there, visible, who know the kids on the streets, who know the neighbors, who know the law-abiding folks. We need to finish the job of putting 100,000 police on the street."", ""We need to build on the Brady bill. I'm so proud tonight that when the Democratic Convention opens one of the people who's going to speak is the wife of Jim Brady, who was President Reagan's Press Secretary until he was almost killed when President Reagan was shot. And Jim and Sarah Brady have spent their lives not as Republicans, not switching parties to the Democratic Party, just being Americans trying to say, this is crazy for us to keep letting felons get guns."", ""And when they passed the Brady bill, I was proud to sign it, and I worked hard to pass it. I didn't agree with the politicians who were afraid to tell the American people that on this issue the NRA was wrong, that it wasn't going to kill anybody to wait 5 days to get a handgun while we checked their records. Sixty thousand felons, fugitives, and stalkers don't have guns today. We're safer. I'm proud of it. And Sarah Brady is going to speak at the Democratic Convention tonight because we stood for that, and I'm proud of that."", ""But we have to do more, more to help our streets be safe, more to help our families be strong. I just want to mention a couple of things I talked about in Columbus today at the police academy. The Brady bill today covers felons. It ought to cover violent misdemeanors, specifically domestic violence. People that have engaged in domestic violence should not be able to have handguns. And we ought to ban copkiller bullets. I've been trying to do this ever since I got there. I don't understand why in the world we need bullets that pierce bulletproof vests. There is not a deer in the woods in America wearing a Kevlar vest. We don't need them. The police need them. We ought to do it."", ""Finally, there are more things we can do for our families and our kids. All over America local communities are finding their own solutions. I have tried to put the Government on the side of helping local communities do whatever they want, whether it's school uniforms for junior high schoolers or grade schoolers, or tougher curfew laws or truancy laws. I've tried to support the things that gave local communities the sense that they were taking responsibility for their children's lives. We need to do more."", ""We adopted a law which requires all new televisions to have a V-chip in it. And the television industry, thank God for them, agreed to rate television programs, so within a couple of years parents will be able to buy a TV guide and buy a television and decide, if there is 100 channels on the television, what things their young children should not see on television. I think that's a good thing. We need to finish that."", ""We worked hard to get an order from the Federal Communications Commission, agreed to by the entertainment industry, that will give us 3 hours of good, positive educational television programs at nighttime for our kids—3 hours a week, in the next couple of years. That's going to be a positive thing. But we have to do more. And I ask you all to support that. We have got to keep working to make childhood special, childhood safe, childhood have integrity, and we all have a responsibility for it."", ""Let me finally say this: I know there is going to be a lot of debate in this election about the tax cut proposal that the other side has made, and it sounds good. It's bigger than— I'll tell you right now, it's a whole lot bigger than the tax cut I'm promising. I fess up. I promise it is. But there is a big difference between the one I'm promising you and the one they are. We can pay for mine. I will not propose anything in my speech Thursday night to the American people or anything in this campaign that cannot be paid for while we still balance the budget. Why? What's that got to do with you in this great town? Because that means low interest rates, more investment, more jobs, more small businesses, higher wages. We have worked too hard for too long with high interest rates, nobody getting a raise, and unemployment too high. We have turned this thing around. We can't afford to turn back now. We have got to do that."", ""It also means if you take a tax cut 5 times bigger than mine what that means is—according to our friends in the other party, not me— it means your interest rates will be 2 percent higher on your home mortgage, your car payment, your credit card payments. It also means the economy will slow down. It also means they'll have to cut Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment even more than they did in that budget I vetoed. And then when they shut the Government down, I vetoed it again. I'm not going to put up with it. I don't think you should. I think we can go forward together. We don't need that; we can go forward together."", ""My fellow Americans, America is on the right track to the 21st century. But we have a lot of work to do. We have to be true to our values. We have to meet the challenges of the future. But I will say again, you look at every child in this audience; that's what this election is about. The best days of America are ahead, we just have to have the courage and the vision to seize the future. I hope you will help me do that. Will you do it? [Applause]"", 'God bless you. Thank you.']"

I want to thank him for the work he's done on the economy, on foreign policy, on defense. I want to thank him for worrying about our children being able to grow up in a safe world. And I want to just cite two things."", ""It is true, as Senator Glenn said, that while some of our friends in the other party would criticize Government, they did much to downsize it. We have the smallest Federal Government since John Kennedy was President. It's very efficient, and we didn't have to throw a lot of people in the street to do it. And we saved billions of dollars of your tax money, thanks in no small measure because of the leadership of John Glenn."", ""I will also tell you, when you hear a word like nuclear proliferation, it sounds like a big old word and you can't imagine what it means. It means, among other things, that tonight and in the last 2 years, for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age, there is not a single nuclear weapon pointed at the children of the United States, thanks in no small measure to John Glenn."", ""I've got a few folks I'd like to recognize.

I like that Bill of Rights poster, but now that I\'m 50 years old, it may not be truth in advertising anymore. [Laughter]', ""Yesterday Chelsea and I started out with Hillary in West Virginia. We went into Kentucky; then we came into Ohio. We've had a wonderful day on this train. I wanted to take this train through the heartland to Chicago because I wanted to see people like you, the people I've been working for for the last 4 years, on the way to accept, for the second time, the nomination of my party for President."", ""I also very much wanted you to see us on this train because it's not only on the right track to Chicago, this train is on the right track to the 21st century, and I want you to keep us on it."", ""Folks, 4 years ago I came before the American people—and it is true what Senator Glenn said, Ohio put me over the top in the nomination and put me over the top in the general election, and I hope you will do it again. But when I came before you, I had never before served in office in Washington. I spent most of my time in places like Bowling Green. I identified with schools like Bowling Green State—and I thank you for the music and the cap. And Dr. Ribeau and anyone else who's here from the university, I thank you for the music, the cap, the jogging outfit, but I thank you most of all for the military aide who's here with me tonight. You may know, the President gets a distinguished military aide from each branch of the service. My Coast Guard military aide, Lieutenant Commander June Ryan, is here with me tonight, a graduate of Bowling Green State. She's over there somewhere. Where is she? Come here, June. You did a good job, didn't you? Give her a hand. [Applause] Thank you. She's an Iowa farm girl. There aren't many oceans bordering Iowa, but somehow she made it into the Coast Guard, and I know you all gave her a good start here."", 'The thing that was bothering me when I ran for President was the economy was stagnant. As Marcy Kaptur never fails to remind me, there were and there still are too many bluecollar workers, people that work hard and never seem to get a raise, never seem to get ahead. Unemployment was high. The crime rate was going up. There are a host of problems that were going unchallenged. Cynicism was on the rise in the country. And I wanted to do something about it.', ""I wanted to bring some hope and direction and movement and progress back into American life. And I thought we had to change the way people were thinking in Washington, away from the kind of intensely partisan rhetoric and intensely stale debate. If you listen to things coming out of Washington, very often it sounded like it was more about who to blame than what to do. I'm more interested in what to do than who to blame, and I think you are, too."", ""So, for the last 4 years, we've been out there doing. I have a vision of the 21st century for America. I believe they'll be our best days. I believe the children in this audience will have more chances to live their dreams than any generation of Americans in history. The global economy, the information explosion, the computer explosion, the technology discoveries, the medical discoveries, it is unbelievable. We just commissioned—let me give you an example—we just commissioned a supercomputer between IBM and the Federal Government. We're going to build one that will do more calculations in a second than a person with a hand-held calculator can do in 30,000 years. That's how we're growing. There is more computer power, more computer power in a Ford Taurus today than there was in the first spaceship that went to the moon in 1969. That's how fast things are changing."", ""But we also know we've got some problems in this country. And what I want to do is to build an America for the 21st century where the American dream is open to everybody who is responsible enough to work for it, an America where we're coming together across the lines that divide us, not being torn up by race and religion and other things that are just engulfing the world, from Bosnia to the Middle East to Northern Ireland to Africa—you name it. All over the world people are fighting because of their differences."", ""In our country, we're not about race and religion. If you believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, and you're willing to show up for work tomorrow, you're our kind of person, you're part of our America, and we're going forward together. That's what we believe."", ""And I wanted our country to continue to be what John Glenn has given his life for it to be, the leading force for peace and freedom and prosperity in this whole world. And I believe we can achieve that. And I want to give you a report compared to 4 years ago: We passed a sweeping economic program in 1993 that, as Senator Glenn said, cut the deficit 60 percent 4 years in a row and every year of this administration. That's the first time it's happened since the 1840's. And if it were not for the interest we're paying on the debt run up in the 12 years before I came here, we'd have a surplus in the budget today, and that's important for you to know."", ""Now, what does that mean in Bowling Green? It means lower interest rates. It means lower home mortgage payments, more homeowners, 4 1/2 million new American homeowners. Ten million Americans have refinanced their mortgage at lower interest rates. It means lower car payments. It means lower credit card rates. And most important of all, it means new investment, new businesses. We've got a record number of new businesses started and 10 1/4 million new jobs in 3 1/2 years. We're better off than we were 4 years ago."", ""We have worked to deal with the problems we heard Americans talking to us about 4 years ago. Our administration worked hard to try to deal with the health care problems of ordinary Americans. We've worked to contribute to the decline in the medical inflation rate, so that the costs wouldn't keep going through the roof. And I'm proud to say last year health care costs increase was the lowest it's been in 23 years, and this year it's running under 2 percent. And last week, right before I left, I signed a bill the Congress passed, the Kassebaum-Kennedy health care bill, that says no longer can you be denied health insurance because somebody in your family has been sick or lose it because you changed jobs. That's a good thing for America. Twenty-five million Americans will be helped by that."", 'What else have we done? I knew that there were a lot of people who were working hard, raising their kids, and still falling further and further behind. In 1993, we tried to create more good jobs by helping small businesses. If they invest more in their business, they can get a tax cut. And then again in 1996, just before I came here, we did some very important things. We raised the minimum wage for 10 million American workers. We preserved the tax cut we won in 1993 for the 15 million Americans working hard with children on the most modest income so we could cut their taxes. This year that\'s worth about $1,000 for a family of four with an income below $28,000. When you get down to those lower wages and there\'s still people with kids in the home, we wanted to say clearly, ""If you work full time and you\'ve got children in your house, the tax system will not put you in poverty, it will lift you out of poverty. You\'re entitled to raise your kids in dignity.""', ""That minimum wage bill did some other things, too. It gave another tax break to small businesses. So now we have increased by 2 1/2 times the tax relief 90 percent of our small businesses can get if they invest more money in their business. I'm proud of that. They're creating most of the new jobs. Most of us are going to be working for small businesses. We better create a climate in America second to none for small businesses to grow and flourish. And I know all of you will support that."", ""We've tried to help families do a better job in raising their kids and working. I think it's fair to say that maybe the number one worry of most families in this country is how to raise their kids and do a good job of that and still do a good job at work. There's probably not a family in this audience tonight that hadn't had some problem at some time in juggling the demands of school for your kids or health care for your kids or just being with your kids and the responsibility to be at work. We passed the family and medical leave law that says you can have a little time off without losing your job if there's a baby born or a sick child or a sick parent. Marcy Kaptur and John Glenn voted for that law and strongly supported it. And in the last 3 years, 12 million American families have made use of it, and our economy is stronger, not weaker, than it was 3 years ago. It helps to lift up families and support children. And people are more productive at work when they can do it."", ""And last week, in the minimum wage law, we did something else that was good for families. I signed a bill that gives a $5,000 tax credit to any couple willing to adopt a child and give that child a good home, and an even more generous one if the child is disabled. And it removed the barriers to cross-racial adoption. So now we can say there are hundreds of thousands of kids out there trapped in foster care; they need loving homes. We have now made it more economically feasible for people to really be profamily for those kids, too. And I'm proud of that."", ""Four years ago, a lot of Americans talked to me about crime. I started off this morning at the Ohio police training academy, and I talked about the crime problem. Let me just say, I have a simple strategy: more police, more punishment, more prevention; take the serious offenders and punish them; do what you can to prevent crime from occurring; and help to save the kids—give them something to say yes to as well as to say no to; and put more police officers on the street to catch criminals and prevent crime. That's been our strategy for 4 years in a row. The crime rate has been coming down in the United States of America, and I'm proud of that."", ""There's been a lot of talk in the news in the last few weeks about welfare reform because I signed the welfare reform bill. It's a little bit longer story than that, and I want to talk to you about it. Nearly every American I talked to for years wanted us to do something about welfare because they felt that it trapped people in dependency. The people I met on welfare wanted me to do something about welfare. They wanted a path to independence. Most poor people want what we want for everybody else; they want to succeed with their kids, and they want to succeed at work. They want to be good, productive citizens."", ""And so we sat about 3 years ago working with the States to give people permission to move people from welfare to work. On the day I signed the bill, already three-quarters of the people in America were under such experiments. We have reduced the welfare rolls by a million and a half since I became President of the United States, moving people out there into the work force. And I'm proud of that."", ""But I signed this bill because we need to do more. But let me tell you, folks, the welfare reform bill is the beginning, not the end. What it does is to say nationally, we're going to protect all these families. We're going to protect their medical care. We're going to give them child care when the parents go to work. We're going to make sure the kids are in the school lunch program and can show up and get extra nutritional help that they need. But we're going to give the money that used to be in the welfare check to the States to devise ways to put people to work."", 'I want to talk a lot on Thursday night about this. But let me just say to you, if you care about this and if you want what I want, you want poor people to have the same life that everybody else has, having a chance to succeed at home and at work, then let\'s say to everyone in America without regard to party, ""Let\'s don\'t let welfare reform be a fraud. If you\'re going to make people go to work, make sure they have jobs to find when they go to work."" We have to create more jobs in this country so people can work.', ""When I look out at all these children I think about our natural environment. And one of the things I think we have to do to be responsible to the future is to find a way to grow the economy and preserve the environment. Fifty million Americans are breathing cleaner air than they were 4 years ago. We have upgraded the standards for meat inspections, for putting pesticides on crops that become food. We have cleaned up more toxic waste dumps in 3 years than were cleaned up in the previous 12. We created the biggest national park south of Alaska in California. We saved Yellowstone Park, our Nation's great treasure, from a gold mine. We are pushing forward to preserve the environment and to promote the economy."", ""Finally, let me say one other thing that I think is important. I believe you can have opportunity and responsibility, but it has to be for everybody, and then we have to treat everybody the same. That's why I've reacted so strongly against the church burnings of black churches and the burnings of white churches and the people who have defaced the mosques and the synagogues in this country."", ""This was a country founded in religious liberty. That's why I was so angry the other day when African-American soldiers in the Special Forces in North Carolina found swastikas painted on their doors. Let me tell you something, folks, the Special Forces are just what they say; they're special forces. If I call them at midnight tonight and tell them to be halfway around the world by noon tomorrow to defend you and put their lives on the line, they'll do it. They don't deserve to be discriminated against because of their race. That's not America. That's not America."", ""And so I say to you, we have to bring this country together and go forward together. The reason I vetoed the budget that passed was not because I didn't want a balanced budget. I presented a balanced budget. But we can't have a balanced budget if we cut student loans and cut back on Head Start and cut back on problems that improve education. We can't have a balanced budget if we cripple our ability to protect our environment. We can't have a balanced budget if we take unnecessary cuts in the Medicare program that aren't necessary to save it. We can't have a balanced budget if you walk away from our commitment to guaranteed medical care for the elderly, for families with persons with disabilities in the family, for pregnant women, and for poor children. We've got to go forward together. That's what that whole thing was all about."", ""And as I go forward into Chicago, I want you to know that's the record we've made. But we've made a beginning; we have more to do. What is the task of the next 4 years? We have our economic house in order. We've got to make sure it's possible for every single solitary American to take part in this economic recovery and to live out their dreams and to take care of their families. That has to be our task for the next 4 years. That means to me, among other things—I just want to mention just a couple of things that I want to do in the next 4 years."", ""Number one, I want to make at least 2 years of college as universal for Americans as a high school education is today. Now, how do we propose to do that? By giving a $10,000 tax deduction to families for the cost of college tuition for any kind of education after high school and a $1,500 refundable tax credit for the first 2 years of college, if that helps you more. That will get everybody through a community college in any State in the country just about. That's a good thing to do, and we ought to do it."", ""Number two, I want to make sure that every child in every school in America has the same chance everybody else does to grow and learn, which means we not only need computers in every school and classroom, and also trained teachers, but all those classrooms need to be connected to this vast information superhighway, that will give any child anywhere in America, in the poorest inner-city neighborhood, in the most remote mountain village, access to the same information that any other child has anywhere in the world. We're going to connect all those classrooms by the year 2000, if you'll let us do it."", ""And finally let me just say one word about health care. We have done a good thing by saying you can't have your health insurance taken away from you if you change jobs, and you can't be denied if you've got somebody in your family who is sick, but we still have good, hard-working people who are unemployed for longer periods than they used to be. I want to see us also help those people who are unemployed, who are dying to get back in the work force, keep their families in health insurance for at least 6 more months. And that's a noble and good thing to do. The kids need it. It will help them perform in school. It will help the families stay together. It will make America stronger. I hope you'll support it."", ""And all these things—the last thing I want to say is, we can afford a tax cut, but we ought to only have the tax cut we can afford—remember what I said—because we're bringing the deficit down, because everybody knows we're going toward a balanced budget, your interest rates are lower. That's lower mortgage payments, lower car payments, lower credit card payments, more business investment, and more jobs."", ""And finally, for the first time in a decade, for the last 2 years average wages are rising again. We can't jeopardize that, but we can afford a family-friendly tax cut, a $500 tax credit for children under 13, the education tax deductions that I just mentioned, and an IRA available to families making up to $80,000, moving up to $100,000 a year, that you can withdraw from without any penalty to buy the first home, to deal with a medical emergency, and to educate your kids or yourselves. That is a program we can afford, and that's what we ought to have. It will build America and balance the budget."", ""Well, that's the America I want to build for the 21st century. Will you help?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Will you help for 70 more days?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Will you help for 4 more years?', 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. Thank you, and God bless you. Hang in there! Let's go!""]"
34,William J. Clinton ,"August 26, 1996","[""The President. Thank you so much to the citizens of Toledo. Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for making us feel so very welcome tonight. Now, I want to tell you first of all, I love Toledo, and I love to spend the night here. I love to run along the water here in the morning. And I'm delighted to be back. I've still got my Toledo Mud Hens cap. And I'm glad to be back. I also want to tell you that if you saw Senator Glenn and I talking a little while the program was going, you need to know that at some point in about 15 minutes I'm going to stop, and the whole country is going to see you, because we're going to be talking back and forth to our convention in Chicago. So I want you to help me. Will you do that? [Applause]"", ""Now, in the meanwhile, I'd like to talk to you a few moments. First, I want to acknowledge your mayor and thank him for his vigorous leadership to help develop Toledo economically and to help fight the crime problem and working with us on it."", ""Secondly, let me say, there is not in the entire United States Congress another Member of the Congress who is as active and energetic and aggressive and effective on behalf of the constituents as Marcy Kaptur is for you. She's fought for your jobs; she's fought for your welfare; she's fought for your values. You can be proud of her."", ""And let me say of Senator Glenn, I have known very few people in public life that I would say I admired as much as John Glenn. He is an American hero and a national treasure. He's too modest to tell you, but we did downsize the Government, but we didn't put those Federal employees in the street. We didn't cast them off and forget about them. We gave them early retirement. We helped them find other things to do. And we used the opportunity of the savings to do things like put 100,000 more police back on your streets, to bring your deficit down. And we used ways to save money and increase the effectiveness of national defense, increase the effectiveness of our ability to respond to emergencies. We cut the budget of the Small Business Administration, for example, and doubled the loan volume. We did those kind of things, in large measure in 1993 and 1994, with the help and leadership of John Glenn. And he deserves a lot of credit for it."", ""I also—a lot of Ohioans know that Senator Glenn is one of America's leaders on the problem of nuclear proliferation. That's a big old word, but I'll tell you what it means now. During this administration—and thanks in no small measure to the leadership of John Glenn—for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age, on this night, this beautiful night, there is not a single nuclear missile pointed at a child in the United States of America. And we can be proud of that."", ""I want to thank the CitiFest organization for helping this to become possible. I want to thank our Lucas County Democratic chair, Keith Wilkowski, for his work on this. And I want to mention two other folks, one, the gentleman to my right who is sitting over there with Chelsea. He's one of yours. His name is Robert Wyckoff. He was wounded fighting for your country in World War II, but he had never received, after all these years, the combat medals he earned, including a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. Well, 50 years too late, on our train tonight, just before we got to Toledo, it was my great honor to pin on Robert Wyckoff the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart he earned for our country before. Would you stand up, sir? Let's give him a hand. [Applause] Thank you."", ""There's another person I want to introduce tonight who is not here, and you'll understand in a minute. Marcy gave Chelsea the keys to the Jeep. [Laughter] One of the things I'm proudest of in America's economic recovery is that for the first time in 20 years, the United States is the auto capital of the world. We're producing more cars than the Japanese, and we're selling more around the world. And tonight, tonight in Chicago at our convention, an autoworker from Toledo named Todd Clancy is speaking on behalf of the working people of America. And I know you can be proud of him."", ""We have had a wonderful time. We've been to West Virginia, Kentucky. We've been all over Ohio. We started this morning at the State police training academy in Columbus. We've been to Arlington. We had an unbelievable rally in Bowling Green. We are having a good time taking the train across America's heartland, a train that gives me a chance to thank you for giving me the chance to serve as your President, to say that I have worked for you, and to look in your eyes and tell you we've been up there for 4 years every day trying to help you go forward. And we'd like 4 more, because America is on the right track, the right track."", 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. Thank you. Thank you so much. We're on the right track. And I'll tell you, I want you to watch our convention. We're going to have a good time. And I'm glad a few of our friends from the other party showed up tonight with their signs. You're welcome here. We're glad to have you here."", '[At this point, there was a disturbance in the audience.]', 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. No, don't boo them. Don't boo them. Don't boo them. We're glad to have them here. But our convention is going to be a little different. We're not going to hide our leaders. We're going to parade them out on the stage and say we're proud of them. And I have read our platform. I'm proud of it, and we're all glad to run on it. We're not running away from it. And we don't need to avoid our record or distort it. We'll just run on our record and on our ideas for the future. We're proud of it. We're proud of it. We're proud of it."", ""I want you to think about what has been going on for the last 4 years. When I came to see you 4 years ago and I asked you to take a chance on me, I had never worked as an elected official in Washington, DC. I ran for President because I was worried about what was happening to my country, because we had high unemployment and stagnant wages, because we had a rising crime rate, a host of unsolved social challenges, a widening rift among our people, a growing sense of cynicism about the ability of political leaders to make a difference in ordinary people's lives. And I was sitting out there in my home State going to work every day as our State's Governor, and I didn't like it and I decided I'd try to make a difference. And I asked you to help me."", 'And on June 2, 1992, the votes of Ohio gave me a majority of the delegates I needed to be nominated. In July of 1992, at the national convention, the delegation from Ohio cast the votes that put me over the top. And as John Glenn said, in November of 1992, when they called Ohio for Bill Clinton and Al Gore, the commentator said, ""As Ohio goes, so goes the Nation. They will win the election.""', ""And so tonight, my friends, I come to you to make a report, to say we are on the right track, but we have more to do; to ask you to join with me for the next 70 days to tell your friends and neighbors, whether they're Democrats, Republicans, or independents, about what has happened in America these last 4 years, what the choice is in this election, and what we still have to do."", ""Look at the record. Look at the economy. You heard Senator Glenn say that we brought the deficit down in all 4 years of this administration for the first time since before the Civil War. That's the last time that happened, in the 1840's. I'm proud that our Democrats did that. I wish we had had some help from the folks in the other party, but I'm glad we did it anyway. I'm glad we did it. We paid a price for it, but I'm glad we did it."", ""Do you know that we would have a surplus in Washington today in your budget—a surplus—were it not for the interest run up when we quadrupled the national debt in the 12 years before I took office. If we didn't have to pay interest on the debt in the 12 years before I took office, we'd have a surplus in that budget today. We've got to keep on going until we balance it, to keep the interest rates down and the jobs coming back to America. That's what we need."", ""But we have to balance that budget in the right way. Last year, I presented a balanced budget. The congressional leaders presented their balanced budget. They passed theirs and didn't want to talk about mine. And I vetoed it because it had cuts that were too big in education and the environment, in Medicare and in the Medicaid guarantees for our people. I vetoed it because it raised taxes on the poorest working people in America. I vetoed it because it allowed workers' pensions to be raided by corporations, and we spent the whole last several years trying to secure workers' pensions. So yes, I did. But I'm still for balancing the budget. We have cut the deficit 60 percent, and we're still going to do it. But we're going to do it in the right way. They can shut the Government down if they want to. I will not be blackmailed, not ever. We're going to do it in the right way."", ""Let's look at education. Today, there are more children in Head Start. Our schools have funds to promote safe and drug-free schools that they didn't have before. They have funds that help them to stay open in after hours—we need a doctor here. We got one. Thanks. They have funds to stay open after hours when these kids often need someplace to go so they don't get in trouble. There are literally hundreds of thousands of young people who now have lower cost college loans because of the initiatives we have. And the AmeriCorps program has given young people a chance to serve in their community and earn money for college. Those are things we did, and we're proud of it. We're proud of it."", ""But, my friends, we must do more. We ought to put a million children in Head Start. We ought to hook up every classroom in America not only with computers and qualified teachers but hook them all up to the information superhighway so every child has access to the best education. And we need to make the first 2 years of education after high school as universal in the next 4 years as a high school education is today. If you vote for me, that's just what we're going to do."", ""I want to give a tax credit worth $1,500 to every family so you can go to a community college. And every single American will know, at the very least, we can all get a community college education. Whatever our age, whatever our station in life, we can all get it. I want to give every working family in this country a tax deduction worth $10,000 a year for the cost of college tuition for the kids or the parents to educate our people. That's what we still have to do."", ""Look where we are with health care. We've worked hard to get the inflation rate down in health care. For the first time in 30 years this year, it's running below the overall inflation rate in the economy. And right before I left to come on this trip, I signed the Kennedy-Kassebaum health care bill which says to 25 million Americans—25 million Americans—no longer can you lose your health insurance because you changed jobs, and you can't be denied because somebody in your family got sick. It is a good bill. It is a good bill."", ""But we need to do more. In our budget we also say—and you know here in Toledo from your lean years, there are a lot of good people who sometimes have to be unemployed for longer than they'd like until they get another job. We think we ought to help the unemployed to keep their health insurance for at least 6 months, and their kids. We believe older women ought to be able to get mammographies. We believe people who are caring for their parents because they've got Alzheimer's disease ought to be able to get a little help with respite care to keep the families together and keep going. We like that. We believe in that. And we can afford that."", 'If you look at where we\'ve come in crime, for 4 years in a row now in the United States, the crime rate, including the violent crime rate, has dropped. I am very, very proud of that, and I know you are, too. But you also know that the crime rate is still too high and we have to do more. We\'re about halfway home in putting those 100,000 police on the street. We have to finish the job. That\'s a big difference between the two parties, I guess, philosophical difference. They voted against the 100,000 police, and they\'ve tried to do away with it a couple of times. And I\'ve said no every time because I know that if you\'ve got those police on the street they\'re not only going to catch criminals, they\'re going to prevent crime, they\'re going to get to know the kids, they\'re going to get to know people that can help to work with the children and say, ""Don\'t commit that crime in the first place."" Let\'s finish the job with 100,000 police in the next 4 years.', ""Let's finish the job with the Brady bill. It's kept 60,000 felons and fugitives from getting handguns. And not a single Ohio hunter has lost their weapon. But you know what? We ought to finish the job of protecting our police officers and people at home. I believe that if someone has committed a crime of domestic violence against a member of his or her family, they ought to be covered by the Brady bill, too. They shouldn't have a weapon they can kill somebody with. And I think we ought to ban those cop-killer bullets. They don't do any good on the hunting trail, but they do a lot of harm in America."", ""If you look at where we are on welfare reform, I've worked hard for 4 years to move people from welfare to work. Seventy-five percent of the people in this country were under welfare-to-work experiments before Congress passed the welfare bill I signed, and we reduced the welfare rolls by 1.5 million people. We can be proud of that. But now—now that we have a new law that says that you're on welfare and you're able-bodied, we'll give your children health care, we'll give you child care, we'll protect your food stamps, but you've got to go to work if you can—we've got to create work so people have the jobs they need."", ""We've worked hard to protect the environment. We've cleaned up more toxic waste dumps in 3 years than they did in 12, and I'm proud of that. Fifty million Americans are breathing cleaner air, and I'm proud of that. The meat standards are higher, the protection against pesticide poisoning is better, and I'm proud of that. But we have to do more. We ought to clean up two-thirds of the waste dumps in this country and keep on proving you can grow the American economy and protect the environment for our children. We know we can do that."", ""Most important of all, my fellow Americans, I have tried as hard as I know how to say that we're going to get into the 21st century with the American dream alive for everybody who's responsible enough to work for it. We're going to get into the 21st century with America leading the world for peace and freedom and prosperity if—but only if—we make up our mind we have to go into that future together, as one community. I don't like the fact that people are too often divided here by race, by religion, and by all kinds of other categories just to try to put somebody down so somebody else can be lifted up. That's not the America I want to live in."", ""Look at what I dealt with as your President, trying to make peace in the rest of the world. Look at the Middle East. Look at Bosnia. Look at Northern Ireland. Look at the problems in Rwanda and Burundi in Africa. You'd think in those poor countries, where people don't have enough to get along, they'd want to roll up their sleeves, work together, and try to help lift each other up. But place after place after place, people define themselves by being able to look down on their neighbors, and it's wrong. But we've got to fight it in America. That's why we've got to stand against those church burnings in the South. That's why if a synagogue is marked up or an Islamic center is defaced, we've got to stand against that, too. In my America, you can be whatever you want to be. As long as you believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence and you're willing to show up, pay your taxes, work hard, and obey the law, you're a part of my America and we're going into the future together. That's what I believe."", ""And so we're on the right track to Chicago and to the 21st century. The best days of this country are still before us. Our children will do things we haven't even imagined yet. These children in this crowd tonight will have lots of jobs that haven't been invented yet if we do what we know is right, to create more opportunity for all Americans, to get more responsibility from all Americans, and to go forward and grow forward as one American community."", 'That will take America into the 21st century. That will keep Toledo growing and going. That will make us very, very strong and keep us the hope of the world. That is the commitment I want from you. Will you help me for the next 70 days?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Will you be there on election day?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. We passed the Family and Medical Leave Act—I love all these signs—we passed the Family and Medical Leave Act to help our families. Twelve million American families got to take some time off without losing their jobs when a baby was born. Will you help us keep it and expand it? Will you stand for things like that? [Applause]', ""And in the next 4 years, are you willing to stand up and keep helping us try to move this country forward, not only by passing laws in Washington but by lifting people up in Toledo? Do you believe that we have to take responsibility for our children? And do you believe that if you're a parent you need to raise your kids and take responsibility, but you need help from the local teachers, from the local churches and synagogues, from the people who run the police departments and the people who look after the hospitals and the people who look after the health of your food? I guess what I'm trying to tell you folks is, I think my wife was right, not them: It does take a village to raise a child."", ""If you believe all that—if you believe all that, you're part of the new Democratic Party. And we're going together into the 21st century because we're on the right track, the country is on the right track, and we're going to take the right track all the way into the best days America has ever, ever, ever known."", 'Thank you, and God bless you.

Last year, because of the partnership we have established when I was in Japan, I went into a dealership, and I sat in a Jeep in a Japanese dealership made in Toledo, Ohio, by American workers. That's the kind of thing I want to see more of."", ""On this train trip, we're saying to the American people—number one, I wanted to go on a train trip to Chicago so I could stop in towns like Wyandotte and look into the faces of the people I've been trying to work for for the last 4 years. But I also wanted to say that this train is on the right track to Chicago and also on the right track to the 21st century for America."", 'The people of Michigan, with all their diversity in the economy and the diversity of our citizens, coming from all walks of life, all faiths, all races, doing all different kinds of things for a living, know as well as anyone that we are going through a period of profound change in how we work, how we live, how we relate to each other, how we relate to the rest of the world.', ""I sought the Presidency because I wanted to make sure we were prepared for the 21st century, because I wanted us to go roaring and united into the next century with the American dream alive for everyone, with every person in this country who's willing to work hard having the chance to live out their dreams and live up to their God-given potential. And we are moving in the right direction to meet that goal."", ""I have followed a very simple strategy; I think it's the basic American bargain: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and then telling every single person, if you will be responsible, if you will seize your opportunity, if you believe in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Bill of Rights, you don't have to tell us anything else. We don't care what your race is. We don't care what your religion is. We don't care where you started out in life. If you're willing to work hard and share our values, we'll join arm in arm with you and walk together into the future. You're a part of our America."", ""Yesterday in Ohio I talked mostly about responsibility and especially about our responsibility to make our streets, our schools, our neighborhoods safe for our children, to bring down the crime rate. Today I've been talking about opportunity. In Toledo we talked about how we work together and how management and labor work together to create hundreds of new jobs and how America, after 20 years, is now number one again in the production and sales of automobiles because of what we have done."", 'Here, I come to this library with all these schoolchildren because their future is our future and because we need to talk about another kind of opportunity, educational opportunity, without which America cannot triumph in the global economy, in the information age of the 21st century.', ""We've been making some progress on opportunity in Washington. Just last week, as Mr. Dingell said, I signed a bill to raise the minimum wage for 10 million Americans, including 325,000 here in Michigan. But you know, even in Michigan, the manufacturing capital of the world, there are most people working for small businesses. So that minimum wage bill also contained a tax cut for small businesses that invest more in their business to create more jobs and income, and it contained provisions making it easier for small-business people and their employees to take out pensions and to keep those pensions when they change jobs, and that's very important."", ""And there's a third thing that that bill contained that I believe every single American, without regard to party or conviction, can agree on; that bill did some dramatic things to encourage the adoption of children who do not have permanent homes. It gave a $5,000 tax credit to families who adopt a child, a bigger one if the child has a disability. And it removed the historic barriers to cross-racial adoption. There are hundreds of thousands of kids out there who need loving, strong parents in good homes. This bill did it. This bill was good for workers, good for business, good for families. It was a great American bill, and I'm proud of it."", ""I also signed the Kassebaum-Kennedy health care bill to make 25 million Americans more eligible for health insurance by simply saying you can't be denied health insurance anymore if somebody in your family gets sick and you can't lose it if you move from job to job. That is a dramatic step for guaranteeing health access to all. And I thank you, John Dingell, for your lifelong commitment to health care for all Americans. And I thank you, Senator Levin, for your support of that bill."", ""Now let's talk about education a minute. I have worked hard to increase the quality and the availability of education, to expand Head Start, to expand the chapter 1 program so that it helps more poor children reach their full potential, to help school districts and local schools set high standards with grassroots reforms, to give more authority to principals and teachers and parents to basically chart their own course. I will say again, I am grateful for the people who give their lives to education, and I don't think it serves the cause of education to attack the people who are educating our children and carrying our future."", ""We have increased college scholarships for deserving students. We have made dramatic strides in making the college student loan program more affordable and giving better repayment options so that young people can now choose to pay those loans back as a percentage of their future income, and they need never drop out of school or refuse to go just because they're worried about the burden of repaying the loans. That's a terribly important thing that has been done."", ""Let me say that even though we know we have got a good ways to go, there is a lot to be encouraged about in our country. National math and science scores are up. SAT scores are up. The SAT scores in math are now at a 24-year high. ACT scores have gone up 3 out of the last 4 years. And as Dr. Cole said, that's an America that is more diverse, culturally, racially, religiously, and economically, than ever before, and we're still moving forward into a bright new future with improving education."", 'But we have to do more. Not every child has access to the same information and learning every other child does. By the year 2000, I want to see every classroom in this country not simply have computers and teachers well-trained to teach them how to use them but connected to the information superhighway so that every child in the poorest inner-city school, the most remote rural district, the standard middle class community, and the wealthiest school districts— they all have access to the same unlimited store of information that is the key to our future.', 'I want to see our Nation become involved for the very first time in helping our schools rebuild their dilapidated facilities and build new ones, because we will have the largest number of young people starting school this fall of any class in the history of the United States of America, and they need to have good schools to attend.', ""We want to help States work to set high standards and systems of accountability, so that when people get a diploma it will mean something. We want to open the doors of college even wider. Perhaps this is the most critical thing for those of you who are already out of school or about to be out. We need, in the next 4 years, to make at least 2 years of college as universal as a high school education is today. And that's exactly what I propose to do. I want a $1,500 tax credit refundable to every family who needs it to go to a community college, to pay for 2 years of education after high school. I want every college student, including the parents as well as the kids that are going back to college, to be able to deduct the cost of college tuition up to $10,000 a year. That will revolutionize the cause of education in America."", 'But before that, we must make sure that basic learning is taking place. I told you the good news. Now let me tell you some of the challenging news. Over the last decade, our country has worked hard to raise math and science scores, but reading scores have stayed flat. And it may be because a higher and higher percentage of our young people come from countries and families where English is not their first language. It may be because a lot of our young people live in homes where the parents are having to work two jobs, sometimes three jobs, and don\'t have enough time to spend with them reading. But for whatever reason, we know that our reading scores have not increased as much as our math and science scores, and we know that unless we can read, we will not be able to take advantage of the future or understand the past. That\'s why Justin and Elizabeth were up here, ""The Little Engine That Could"" pointing us the way to the future. That is what we have to have: a Justin and an Elizabeth in every single home in the United States of America.', ""I have come here to this wonderful community to ask all of you to join me, without regard to your political party or your views on other issues, in a simple, straightforward, critical national goal: All America's children should be able to read on their own by the third grade, every single one of them."", ""Look at what we know. We know that students who can't read as well as they should by the third grade are much less likely even to graduate from high school. We know that without reading, the history books are closed, the Internet is turned off, the promise of America is much harder to reach. We know the children who can read can learn from our Founding Fathers, explore the limits of the universe, and build the future of their dreams. If we're going to ensure that those are the children of America's future, they need not only the best possible teaching in school, they need individualized tutoring, help with their homework before school, after school, and over the summer, and they need more parents involved in helping them to learn to read and to keep reading."", ""To meet this challenge we need one million tutors ready and able to give our children the personal attention they need to catch up and get ahead. Today I propose a national literacy campaign to help our children learn to read by the third grade, a plan that offers 30,000 reading specialists and volunteer coordinators to communities that are willing to do their part, people who will mobilize the citizen army of volunteer tutors we need, America's reading corps."", ""We will only succeed, however, if the 30,000 are joined by legions of volunteers, seniors, and teenagers, business and civic groups, libraries and religious institutions and, above all, parents. We have to build on the groundwork we have been laying by AmeriCorps, our Nation's national service program. Today I am giving AmeriCorps a new charge: Make reading central to your mission."", ""Let me tell you what they have done already. Let's just take one place. In Simpson County, Kentucky, a county in rural Kentucky, 25 of our young AmeriCorps volunteers helped 128 second-grade students make up almost 3 years of reading progress in just one school year. We can do that. We can do that."", ""All over America, efforts like this are working. And in several places in America, organized attempts to train, galvanize, and energize parents are making a difference. We worked hard on that when I was the Governor of Arkansas, I've seen the program work in Missouri. Parents should be their children's first teachers, and we should give them the support they need to be those first teachers."", ""There are a lot of things you can do for your children, but nothing will do them much more good in the long run than reading to them every night. I can still remember as many of Chelsea's books as she can. Some of them I can almost remember by heart, because kids want to hear the same ones over and over and over again. But when they grow and they learn to read on their own and you see their imaginations fire and you know their lives are going to be richer because of it, then every single tired night a parent spends reading a book to a child is a night well worth it. Every dollar we spend bringing in people to help these kids after school with personal tutoring is a dollar well worth it. We know our children have to spend more time reading and less time in front of the television set. We know—we know that if every single parent would just spend a half an hour a night reading to their children, within a matter of years there would be no issue about whether our third graders could read as they should. We know that."", ""We know, too, that the private sector can help. Let me say that one thing I'm really proud of in America is the way the business community is moving to change its standards of what's good for business. I was proud when I visited that Chrysler plant in Toledo that they gave their workers an average bonus of $8,000 a year last year because they all made money and they thought the workers were entitled to their fair share. I'm proud of that."", 'But I want you to know something else; when we passed the telecommunications bill not very long ago to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs in the telecommunications industry, we also required new TV\'s to give you, the parents of this country, a V-chip so that parents will be able to control what their younger children see and not see inappropriate material. But it wouldn\'t work if the entertainment industry hadn\'t stepped up to the plate and said, ""We\'re going to start rating television shows the way we rate movies, and we\'re going to give that information to parents and let them make their own decisions."" And now the entertainment industry is working with us to create 3 hours more of prime time educational television programming a week in the next couple of years. People are moving in the right direction. We need more of that.', ""So let me leave you with this thought: We've got 10 million more jobs, a million and a half fewer people on welfare; the crime rate is coming down; child support collections are going up; America is growing together and going forward; wages are rising for the first time in a decade. But the most important thing we have to do is to make sure our children are ready for the 21st century. And I want you to join with me in saying, one way we're going to do that is to make sure every single boy and girl in America can read on his or her own by the time they're in the third grade. Will you do it?"", 'Thank you, and God bless you. Thank you.']"

Thank you very much. Thank you so very, very much. You have made me feel so welcome. I never dreamed when we came to Royal Oak there would be such a vast crowd. I thank you—all the way down here, back here behind us. And when Don Johnson was up here talking and he said, ""Detroit, which is near here,"" I thought, I bet all the people in Royal Oak think of that—Detroit\'s a town that\'s near Royal Oak. [Laughter] I bet that\'s what they think.', ""Let me begin by thanking my good friend Bob Scully and Don Johnson and all the other law enforcement officials who are here and those throughout the Nation for their support. I'm very grateful to them, and I'm very grateful to them for joining me here today."", ""I want to thank Congressman Sandy Levin, your Congressman and a great Congressman. I want you to know that he has worked for you, for your jobs, for your welfare, for the strength of your communities and your values relentlessly. He talks to me all the time, and he wears me out until I finally do what he thinks I should do for you. And I hope you'll keep him in the Congress."", ""I'd like to thank all the other law enforcement officials who are here. I'd like to thank those who performed here, the Kimbal High School Madrigal Singers; the Stagecrafters; David Sign; the Detroit Red Wings who are here, Kris Draper and Stu Grimson; Jim McClain, the emcee. Thank you all very much. I'd like to thank some others who came with me: Congressman Dale Kildee, who's over here on my left; Congressman John Conyers is here; Attorney General Frank Kelley; former Governor Jim Blanchard; Senator Don Riegle."", ""I have a lot of other people from Michigan that are traveling with me on this train. We're having a good time. I also have with me an old friend of mine and one of the great American heroes of the civil rights movement, Mrs. Rosa Parks. Please give her a great hand. [Applause] Thank you, Rosa. God bless you. Thank you, thank you."", ""I'd also like to acknowledge in the audience a very brave lady, the mother of another brave woman who was to visit me in the White House next week. But Denise Marie Lazar just passed away from Huntington's disease. Her mother, Charlene Solo, is here in the audience. I'd like for you to give her a hand. [Applause] She's a brave lady, and she's done a good job. Charlene, where are you? Thank you."", ""Folks, I've had a wonderful day. We've had great crowds from West Virginia to Kentucky, all through Ohio and now in Michigan. But I don't have any idea how many folks we have here. They're way back down the street there, way off down here, way off behind us, and we're glad to see you. We're glad to see you."", ""I want to say to all of you that I came through here on this train for two reasons. First, I wanted to look out into this crowd and see your faces. I wanted to see the people that I have worked for for these last 4 years, and I wanted you to know I'm still working for you and I'm proud to be your President. Secondly, I wanted you to see this train. This train is not just on the right track to Chicago; it's on the right track to the 21st century, and we're going to keep it there."", 'You know, in 1992——', '[At this point, an audience member required medical attention.]', ""The President. We need a doctor over here. We've got one here. We'll get somebody here in a minute; we've got a doctor with us. We need a doctor over here in the crowd. We'll be right there. Let me say—here we go; we're getting somebody there right now. There you go. Here's my medic; they'll be right there. Done. You all can't do anything about that. Let's go on with the program. She's going to do a good job; she's terrific."", ""Four years ago, when I came to Michigan, I was hoping I'd do pretty well here because half the people that lived in Arkansas in the 1950's moved to Michigan to get a job. [Laughter] And the dream they had was largely fulfilled, the dream of being able to find a good job and educate their children and have a secure retirement and build a good life and a strong community and a strong country."", ""Four years ago, I was afraid that dream was about to be lost. We had high unemployment, stagnant wages, no strategy for meeting our challenges, and a rising tide of cynicism among our people. Four years later it's a lot different. We wouldn't have this crowd here if you were cynical today, and we thank you and God bless you."", 'Let me also say that the reason I ran for President 4 years ago is the reason I seek reelection: I wanted to prepare our country for the 21st century. I want us to go into that next century, only 4 years away now, roaring with the American dream alive for every person, a possibility for every person to live up to their God-given abilities, for every person to live out their dreams, no matter where they live, what they start with, what their racial or their religious background is.', ""And we have followed a simple strategy: Create more opportunity for people, expect more responsibility from our people, and tell everybody that we have got to go forward together. We have got to go forward together. We know that this country, when we're together, never loses. And I don't know how you feel but I look around the world today—I spent so much time as your President trying to bring peace to places like Bosnia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, dealing with the slaughters in Rwanda and Burundi. Why? Because all over the world there are people who insist upon looking down on each other because of their racial, their ethnic, their religious, or their tribal differences instead of joining together hand in hand to move forward. And whenever I see that in America I want to stamp it out. That's why I have done everything I could to make us all stand up against the church burnings. And whenever a synagogue or a Muslim center is defaced, it's wrong."", ""We have to fight that. The America I want for our children is one that says, we don't care anything else about you if you believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, you work hard, pay your taxes, obey the law and believe in our country. You're our kind of American, and we're going with you into the 21st century."", ""Now, this has been a great day for me, and last night was a great night when we started our convention. But I want to tell you something about our convention last night. We did something that had never been done before. We just had citizens talk. We had an autoworker from Toledo that I met with again this morning. Toledo—they work—it's the oldest auto plant in America—1910—but they're selling Jeeps in Japan with right-hand drive. It's a plant where there's a genuine partnership between workers and management, where 70 percent of the workers are in continuing education programs and they got a $8,000 bonus last year because they have people who believe that when a company makes money, the workers are entitled to their fair share. And I hope that all of you in Michigan are justly proud that for the first time since the 1970's, it is the United States that is producing more and selling more automobiles than any other country in the entire world."", 'We had a police officer named Mike Robbins from Chicago there. I don\'t know if you heard him speak, but I\'ll never forget when I met him and he said, ""I served my country in Vietnam, in Desert Storm, and by the grace of God I was never harmed. I came home to serve my country on the streets of Chicago, and within 45 seconds I had 9 bullets in my body from an assault weapon. And when I heard the President say we all had to speak up, I decided if I got out of my hospital bed I was going to do my part."" Mike Robbins is the kind of person I\'m fighting for, the kind of person we need in uniform today, the kind of person that\'s giving his life for our people.', ""There was a young Puerto Rican-American girl, an immigrant to our country who dropped out of high school, who spoke. She got in AmeriCorps, our national service program. She started helping younger children to learn, and she decided she was pretty smart herself, so she went back and finished high school. And she's going to a wonderful school, Brown University, and she's going to be a doctor and give something back to her country because we gave her a chance to earn her way through college through national service. There was a retired general, who is now the superintendent of schools in Seattle, Washington, reminding us that education, too, is part of our national security. And of course, there were Jim and Sarah Brady talking about the Brady bill, and they were perfectly wonderful."", ""And then there was Christopher Reeve and his magnificent performance, reminding us that we dare not balance the budget on the backs of the American families with handicapped people and we dare not—dare not—walk away from our obligations to research, to find the answers to the medical and scientific mysteries that still confront us. And I tell you, I was proud of him, and I was proud of him for saying that not everybody who gets hurt like that is an actor with a comfortable income. That's why we have to preserve Medicaid for middle class families with disabilities who deserve to have that kind of help."", ""I say that because, folks, we want our convention to be about you, not about us. We want our convention to be about the connection between our Nation's leaders and the people who really count, people who live in places like Royal Oak, Michigan, all over the United States of America. Now, you think about where we are now compared to where we were 4 years ago, with opportunity, responsibility, and community; 10 million more jobs; a 60 percent reduction in the deficit; 4 1/2 million new homeowners; 10 million homeowners who have refinanced their homes at lower interest rates; a couple of million college students eligible for lower cost college loans with better repayment terms; 1 1/2 million fewer people on welfare and a 40 percent increase in child support payments in the last 4 years; 50 million more Americans breathing cleaner air; more toxic waste sites cleaned up in 3 years than in the previous 12 years. I am proud of that, and you should be, too."", ""But folks, we also want our convention to be about the future, the future we have to build together. And I want to talk to you about that for a few minutes. We've gotten our economic house in order. We have record exports, record small business starts, and we are in good shape overall. But you know as well as I do, there are still a lot of people working hard who'd like a better chance to fully participate in the American dream. There are still these kids coming up that we have to get an education. And I want to focus on not what we've done the last 4 years but what we're going to do for the next four."", 'And let me just give you a few examples. Number one—', 'Audience members. No scab workers! No scab workers! No scab workers!', 'The President. I agree with that.', 'Audience members. No scab workers! No scab workers! No scab workers!', 'The President. Look, can I say something? Wait a minute. You know I agree with that. Get yourself a Congress that agrees with me.', ""So I want you to think about this. Number one, we've got to keep this economy going. And that means we have to find a way to balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment and not raid workers' pension funds and not raise taxes on the lowest income working people and all the other things that were in that budget I vetoed last year, and I'm glad I did."", 'But I want you to listen. We do have to balance the budget. Why? Why have we brought this economy back? Because for the first time since before the Civil War we brought the deficit down 4 years in a row and interest rates have been lower. What happens when interest rates go down? Your home mortgage payment, your car payment, your credit card payment is lower. More important, a business person can go to the bank, borrow money cheaper, and invest to create more jobs and higher incomes for the American people.', ""So I say to you, I want you to have a tax cut, but I want you to have one that we can pay for, balance the budget, and invest in education and the environment and Medicare and Medicaid. Because we have still—if we blow this deficit up again after getting it down, what will happen? Higher car payments, higher home mortgage payments, higher credit card payments, fewer jobs, a slower economy. We've got to keep this thing going on the right track, folks. We've got to have a tax cut that we can afford, that helps families to educate their children, deal with their health care problems, get that first-time home, but still keeps the economy growing and going."", ""The second thing we've got to do is to make sure we do an even better job of educating our children and our adults. In the next 4 years, I intend to spend a great deal of time trying to make sure that every single person in this country gets a world-class education. And I just—let me mention two or three things."", 'Number one, in Wyandotte earlier today, I said that I want us to have a national goal that by the year 2000, every single child in America in the third grade will be reading well at grade level and not be behind. Every one. And we can do that. We can do it.', 'Number two, I want us, by the year 2000, to make sure every single classroom in America and every library not only has computers, not only has teachers qualified to use the computers and teach the kids, but is hooked up to the information superhighway so everybody can know everything every other class can know. Now, you think about this. You think about this. If we can do this, it means in the poorest innercity school, in the most remote rural mountain village, they will have access to the same information that people in the wealthiest schools do today. We can explode learning in America if we just give everybody the same resources.', ""Finally, we have to make it possible for everybody to go on after high school. And my goal is, by the year 2000, to have the 13th and 14th grades, at least 2 years of education after high school, as universal as high school is today. How are we going to do it? We're going to do it with a tax cut we can afford, a $1,500 refundable tax credit for the first 2 years of education after high school, a $10,000 tax deduction for all education after high school for middle class families in America to get people back in school and pay for their education."", ""Folks, we also have to recognize that there are other things to be done to help working people constitute their lives strong and good. Last week we had a good week for America's families. I signed the bill that raised the minimum wage for 10 million Americans. But I want you to know what else it did. I want you to know what else it did. It also gave a tax break to small businesses that invest more in their business and made it easier for small-business people and their employees to take out retirement plans and for those folks to keep those retirement plans when they change from job to job. Since most people work for small businesses, that's important for America. We need for those people to be able to have a retirement."", ""And finally, let me tell you what the minimum wage bill did. It also gave a $5,000 tax credit to any family that adopts a child, and more if they adopt a child that has a disability. And it removed the longstanding prejudice against cross-racial adoptions. There are lots of kids out there without a home. I think we can give more of them homes now. That's pro-family, pro-business, pro-work."", ""The other thing that Congress did last week that I especially liked was to pass the Kennedy-Kassebaum health reform bill. What it says to 25 million Americans in this shape, nobody can deny you health insurance anymore because somebody in your family has been sick. And if you change jobs or you lose your job, they can't automatically take your health insurance away from you. That's a great thing. That's a great thing."", ""But we have more to do. That's a great first step. That was in the health care reform I proposed in '94. I'm so proud of the Congress for adopting it. But now we need to recognize that there are still some things we have to do. Just because you have a right to keep your health insurance doesn't mean you can afford to pay for it."", ""The next step is in the balanced budget plan I have presented: Give unemployed workers and their families health insurance for 6 months after they're unemployed, help them get—[Applause]. And then, we have to find a way for small-business people to join together in pools and buy good insurance policies, like we Federal employees have, at an affordable price. And that's the next step. And there was a lady that had a sign back there I want to comment on. We also have to find a way to provide access to mental health benefits and health insurance. It's a very important thing for our country. The Vice President's wonderful wife, Tipper Gore, has worked so hard on that. So there is still a lot to do."", ""We passed the welfare reform bill, but let me tell you something, folks, that is the beginning, not the end of this process. The reason I signed that bill was, first of all, we've already reduced the welfare rolls by a million and a half by putting people in programs to move from welfare to work. But we need to do more."", 'So when the Congress said, ""Okay, I\'ll give in""—I had to veto two of those bills first— ""we\'ll give people on welfare their health care; we\'ll provide more for child care; we\'ll make sure the kids have food to eat,"" I said, now, we will give what used to be the welfare check to the States, the Federal and the State money. But they then have to decide how to move people from welfare to work. That\'s our next challenge. We have to get more jobs in the inner cities, more jobs in the isolated rural areas. If you\'re going to tell somebody they have to go to work because they\'re able-bodied, they have to have work to find. They have to have a job to go to, and we\'ve got to do that.', ""So there's a lot to do. Let me give you another example. We worked hard to prove that you could grow the economy and clean up the environment, and I believe you can, the toxic waste sites, the clean air, the Safe Drinking Water Act. We have adopted a revolutionary pesticide protection act so that children's food will be more free of dangerous pesticides. We are moving forward. We've changed the meat and poultry inspection system of the country for the first time in 70 years, and that's important. We have to do more."", ""One of the most important things that we're doing that we have to continue is the work we began with the auto industry in 1993, in partnership to develop a new clean car that can get 3 times the mileage of the present cars, clean up the air, and save money for the American people and people all over the world."", ""So there's lots to do. We want to clean up two-thirds of the toxic waste dumps that are still out there. There's lots to do. And I want you to support that. We have an interest in America, in a clean economy—I mean, a strong economy and a clean environment, and we can do both."", 'Audience member. Clean up the—[inaudible].', ""The President. You can say that; I can't. [Laughter]"", 'I just want to mention a couple of other things. These fine police officers have been here. In 1994, a lot of the folks that voted with them for the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban and the 100,000 police got beat when they ran for reelection. They got beat in places like Michigan and Arkansas because we live in a State—I did and you do—where probably nearly half the people have a hunting or a fishing license or both. I guess I was 12 years old the first time I picked up a .22 and started shooting cans off fence posts. But you know, I couldn\'t figure out what they were all saying back in \'94, ""Well, this is a terrible thing if we check to see if a person\'s got a criminal record before we give them a handgun. This is a terrible thing that we\'re not going to keep peddling these assault weapons that were designed to kill people."" And a lot of folks said to folks in Michigan and Arkansas, ""You\'re going to lose your rifle. Boy, they\'re coming after you next."" Let me tell you something, folks. We\'ve had two deer seasons since then; not a single Michigan or Arkansas hunter has lost the rifle they were hunting with in 1994. Not a one. Not a one. Not a one.', ""But according to what Sarah Brady said last night, 100,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers did lose the right to get a handgun, and we're a safer country because of that. I would never knowingly do anything to interfere with the right of the American people to hunting and sporting use of their weapons. But I'm telling you, folks, a lot of those folks who talk about it have never seen the war zone that a lot of American children live in. I have looked into the faces of people who live on blocks where 13-year-old kids have been shot down on lark drive-by shootings. As I said last night, the convention was opened by a man who fought in Vietnam without incident and had his body riddled with 9 bullet holes in 45 seconds."", ""So we can find a way to hunt and to fish and to shoot in contests and to have a big time and protect people. Surely, we can. I want the Congress to ban these cop-killer bullets. They're fighting that, too."", '[An audience member required medical attention.]', ""The President. We need a doctor. They'll get it. We got it. The doctor is already there."", ""You know, I have never seen a deer in a bulletproof vest. [Laughter] And if they can show me one, I'll reassess my position on this issue. But until I find a deer or a duck or a wild turkey wearing a Kevlar vest, I'm going to stick with these folks and be for banning those cop-killer bullets."", ""One last thing, I think one of the biggest dilemmas our people face today—I look out here and see all of you—need a doctor over there? Connie, can we send—we need someone back in the back over here. We'll be right there. Just hold up the signs where you are. Somebody hold up the sign; we'll send somebody right back there."", ""One of the biggest problems people face is trying to balance the demands of childrearing and work. I bet there is not a family here that can't remember a personal instance where you were torn between the demands of your job and the demands of your children. I'll bet you can't think—there is not anybody here that hasn't been through that. That's why I'm so proud that we passed the family and medical leave law. Twelve million Americans got to take some time off from work without losing their job."", ""One other thing, you know it hasn't hurt the economy. We've got 10 1/4 million new jobs and a record number of new small businesses. But 12 million families got to be there when the baby was born or the parent was sick, without losing their job. And I'd like to see that law expanded so that people could have just a little time to make those regular doctor's appointments and regular teacher's appointments with their kids or their parents."", ""I'd like to see the provisions of my balanced budget bill passed so that people on Medicare— that ladies can get regular mammograms who are Medicare-eligible. I'd like to see people who have someone in their families with Alzheimer's they're trying to take care of be able to access some respite care. These things will save us money. They will make us a more humane country. They will strengthen America's families."", ""So I ask you, if you agree we're better off than we were 4 years ago, if you agree we've got to keep working until we create opportunity for all Americans, make all communities responsible, and go forward together, I want to ask you if you will, at least in your mind and heart, will you get on this train with me for 70 days and keep us on the right track? Will you stay with me to take America into the 21st century? Do you believe we can do it?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. I know we can.', 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"

I am sorry that it's been since Harry Truman came here in 1948 since a President has been here. But I'm glad to be following in Harry Truman's footsteps with you today. [Applause] Thank you."", 'Let me begin by saying a thank you to Jay and to Jenna for their work in AmeriCorps, for the example they set for our young people, and for their proof that our young people still care about others and want our country to be a stronger, better, brighter place.', ""Thank you, Mayor Moore, for your enthusiastic welcome and for your leadership. I want to thank all the community leaders, all the school leaders, all the ministers, all the other folks from Pontiac who are here who've made us feel so welcome. Thank you, my good friend Rosa Parks, for being here with us and for inspiring so many people."", 'Thank you, Congressman Kildee, for standing up for America and standing up for the people of this district and standing against what they tried to do in that budget last year when we made our veto stick. Thank you, Senator Levin. Thank you for all your many fights on behalf of the people of Michigan and the people of the United States. I hope you all will send Carl Levin and Dale Kildee back to the United States Congress.', 'I want to thank all the fine people from Michigan who came with me, including your former Governor, Jim Blanchard, and your former Senator, Don Riegle, and a whole bunch of other folks who came here with us.', ""And I'd like to thank my friend Vinnie Johnson for being the emcee. I've never seen him emcee anything, and I was wondering if he had as many moves up here as he did on the basketball court. [Laughter] Did he do well?"", ""I want to thank Alice Moore for singing the national anthem; the Anointed Voices of Praise; the GANG—God's Anointed Next Generation; the Pontiac High School Band; the Pontiac Northern High School Band; the fellow that played the saxophone, Randy Scott. Thank you all. Thank you."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, I'm taking this train through the heartland of America. We've been in West Virginia and Kentucky, all through Ohio and now into Michigan. And I'm doing it for two reasons: First, selfishly, at this, the beginning of what will be my last campaign, to go to Chicago to once again accept the nomination of my party for President, I wanted to go through America's heartland. I wanted to look into the faces, into the eyes, and into the hearts of the people I have been working and fighting for for 4 years to make America a better place. And second, I wanted you to see that not only is this train on the right track, America is on the right track for the 21st century."", ""I'm proud of our convention in Chicago. I wish Hillary and Chelsea were with me. They started out with me, but Hillary had to go home to Chicago, and she's going to speak tonight. I hope you'll go home and watch it and give her a cheer. And our daughter stayed with me a little while longer, but she left me this morning in Toledo because she wanted to hear Mom give her speech, so that's where they are."", ""But we've had a wonderful time on this trip. You heard the mayor say we started the morning in Toledo. Last night an autoworker from Toledo was one of the American citizens speaking at the opening of the Democratic Convention. And he was speaking there because the work we have done with the auto industry to open new markets abroad helped to put 700 jobs in the oldest automobile plant in America, in Toledo, Ohio, built in 1910—an automobile plant since 1910. That 1910 auto plant is exporting over 41,000 Jeeps overseas this year, selling our cars."", ""And let me tell you why it happened. It happened because the UAW and the management have a partnership. It happened because they're working together. It happened because 70 percent of the people in that plant are getting continuing education, and they made so much money for Chrysler last year, the workers got an average bonus of $8,000. Now, why? Because that's a company that believes that if they make money, the workers ought to have their fair share. That's good for America. It's right for America. But guess what? It turned out to be good for the company. For the first time in 20 years, it is the United States that is making and selling the largest number of automobiles of any country in the world."", 'Then we went on to Wyandotte, and there we gathered in front of a beautiful old library, about 100 years old, and a huge crowd turned out. And I was introduced by two really young people—not grown young people, I mean young people—about 8 years old, maybe 7. And we built them little platforms, and they stood up in front of the library and they read the end of that wonderful little children\'s book, ""The Little Engine That Could."" Do you know that story? The little engine had only been used for switching cars. The little engine had never been over the mountain. But the toys couldn\'t get to the boys and girls unless the little engine went over the mountain for the only time in its life. And the little engine kept saying ""I think I can. I think I can."" I still remember reading that book to Chelsea over and over and over again. [Laughter] But you know what? The message gets through. And that\'s a message every child in America, without regard to race or income or background, ought to have, because they can if we give them a chance. They can if we give them a chance.', ""And there in Wyandotte we made a commitment, a commitment to make sure that if this administration is returned, we are going to put out 30,000 tutors; we're going to mobilize a million volunteers. We're going to ask AmeriCorps to take as its main charge teaching children to read so that by the year 2000, every boy and girl in the third grade in America will be able to read well on their own."", ""And then we went to Royal Oak. I didn't see the royal oak, but I saw the biggest crowd of folks I ever saw in a long time. And there the National Association of Police Officers endorsed Bill Clinton and Al Gore in the Presidential election, because for 4 years in a row the crime rate has been coming down in America because we're putting 100,000 police on the street, because we did pass the Brady bill— and according to Mrs. Brady last night at our convention, 100,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers have not been able to get guns, but no hunter has lost a gun since we did that—and because we have to keep working until all of our children are free and safe."", 'I met one young woman police officer up on that platform who was in the D.A.R.E. program. Chelsea still talks about her fifth-grade D.A.R.E. officer. One of the things that we did that I was so proud of was to pass the safe and drug-free schools law, to give our communities the resources to send people into these schools when the children are young and try to help them stay off drugs in the first place. It\'s one thing that isn\'t going so well in this country; teenage drug use is going up. But when the Congress tried to cut the safe and drugfree schools program, I said, ""No, we\'ve got a problem. We need to do more of that."" We turned it around, and we\'re going forward. And they stayed with us.', ""So it's been a wonderful day. And it's real nice now. I look around here, I look in this audience, and I see what makes America great. I want to lead this country into the 21st century with the American dream alive for every person in America. I believe that we ought to have a country where everybody has a chance to live up to their God-given abilities, everyone has a chance to live out their dreams. To do it we have to have opportunity for everybody, responsibility from everybody, and we have to recognize that we are all one country, in spite of all of our differences, and we better get used to it and like it and go forward together."", ""That's what AmeriCorps is about. That's what this Golden Opportunity Club is about. That's what these Scout leaders and the Scouts are all about."", 'Audience member. The cheerleaders!', ""The President. The cheerleaders. Look at the little kids. Give them a hand there. [Applause] And where are our veterans' leaders? We've got some veterans over here somewhere. Thank you. And here's what this is about."", 'Audience members. Teachers!', ""The President. I'm coming to you. [Laughter] Oh, no, no, no. I'm coming to you. I've got a special thing to say about you."", ""So here's what I want you to think about. I want all of you to think in your own mind: What do I want my country to look like when we start this new century? What do I want my country to look like when my children are my age? What kind of legacy do I want to leave to my grandchildren? If we have more opportunity, more responsibility, and we're one American community, there is no stopping this country. Our best days are ahead. That's what I've been working on."", ""Number one, I knew when I became President we had to get that deficit down to get interest rates down to put people back to work. Now we've got over 10 million new jobs, and we're just getting warmed up. We brought the deficit down 4 years in a row for the first time in a President's administration since before the Civil War. We would have a surplus today in our budget—a surplus—if it weren't for the interest we have to pay on the debt run up in the 12 years before I showed up. But I'm working on it, and I want you to let me finish the job. I want you to let me finish the job. And we did this, and we're going to balance that budget without cutting education, cutting environmental protection, and breaking the backs of Medicare and Medicaid."", 'And we have to make sure that ordinary Americans can benefit from this economy. We have got to do that. We had a good week for ordinary Americans last week. We raised the minimum wage for 10 million workers. The same bill contained a tax cut for small businesses, who create most of our jobs, so they can invest more in their businesses, and made it easier for them to take out pensions for themselves and their workers and for the workers in small businesses to keep those pensions when they change jobs. That was a good thing.', ""The same bill gave a $5,000 tax credit to adults who will adopt children, and even more if the children have disabilities. And it removed the barriers to cross-racial adoption. There's a lot of kids out there that need a happy home. That was a good thing to do, that we did."", ""And the Congress passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill that your two Members here had been working for for a long time. It says to 25 million Americans, just because somebody in your family has been sick, they can't take your insurance away from you anymore. It says you don't lose your insurance when you change jobs. This is a good thing."", ""But we have to do more. We have to do more. We ought now to say just because you can't lose your insurance doesn't mean you can pay for it. We ought to help families that are unemployed keep their health insurance for 6 months. I'm for that. I want to help people who have someone in their family with Alzheimer's and they're trying to care for them, get a little respite care. That's in my balanced budget plan, too, so they can keep their families and take care of them. We have to do more."", 'And I want you to believe that we can do these things.', ""The most important thing we have to do is to make sure every child in this country and every adult in this country can get the education they need. And I want to say to you—I don't know about the rest of you, but I wouldn't be standing up here if it weren't for my teachers, the people that believed in me. And I know that not every school is perfect and not every class is successful, but we've still got a public education system that is doing its best to take everybody that comes in the door and give all those kids a chance. And some of these teachers are laboring under great difficulties. And so I say to you, we need to make a commitment that we're going to do what we can to take responsibility for our schools and lift up the people that are trying to make them work, not get out here and bash them day-in and dayout. We need to be lifting them up."", 'I want to see—I want to see every classroom in this country, every single one, in 4 years not only have the computers they need, not only have teachers trained in the computers, but I want every single classroom hooked up to the worldwide information superhighway—everyone.', ""Now, consider what this means. This could mean that for the first time in the history of the United States ever, children in the poorest urban classrooms, children in the most remote hill or hollow of Appalachia, would have access to the same information in the same time at the same quality as the children in the wealthiest, best financed schools in the United States of America. It has never happened before. Then we'll see what happens on those test scores. Then we'll see what happens."", ""I want to see an America where every young person can go to college and every adult can go to college. Four years from now, I want 2 years of education after high school, the equivalent of a community college diploma, to be just as universal as a high school diploma is today. And I want to give you a tax credit to pay for those 2 years and a deduction for all college costs to up to $10,000 a year of tuition. That's a tax cut. That's a tax cut we can pay for and a tax cut that will pay for itself many times over. We need to do that."", ""Well, there's a lot more I'd like to tell you, but you get the idea. We've got 10 million more jobs, 1 1/2 million fewer people on welfare."", ""Twelve million people took advantage of the family and medical leave law and didn't lose their jobs, and that's a good thing for America. We've got 4 1/2 million new homeowners, 10 million American families who refinanced their homes at lower interest rates, 50 million Americans breathing cleaner air. We cleaned up more toxic waste dumps in 3 years than the previous administrations did in 12. You get the picture. You get the picture?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. We're on the right track. We're moving in the right direction. We've got 10 million people with a minimum wage increase. But we've got to do it."", 'Will you help us stay on the right track?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Will you help us all the way to November?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Will you stay with us all the way to 2000?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Will you stand with the children in your community?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President.

38,William J. Clinton ,"August 27, 1996","['The President. Thank you. Thank you so much.', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's great to be back at Michigan State. Thank you. I want to thank first Letha Miller for that wonderful introduction and for her example. Weren't you proud of her? I thought she did a great job."", ""I thank President McPherson and your board chairman, Bob Weiss, for welcoming me. I know the mayors of Lansing and East Lansing are here. And somewhere Senator Levin has a Lansing Lugnuts baseball cap for me. I don't know where it is, but I'm prepared to wear it. There it is. What do you think? I like it."", ""I would like to thank the Olympians who are here from Michigan: Paul McMullen, Eric Namesnik, and Mike Castle. I'd like to thank the Paralympian, Ed McGinnis. I'd like to thank especially my good friend Carl Levin for being here, and I hope you'll send him back to the Senate from Michigan. He's a good man who does a good job for you."", ""And I want to say a special word about Debbie Stabenow, who is running for Congress. I'm very proud of the fact that we put in the direct loan program to lower the cost and improve the repayment terms of college loans so no one would ever have to decline to go to college because of the loan burden. Everyone can pay it back as a percentage of their income. I'm very proud that we increased Head Start. I'm very proud that we did things for education. And I'm proud that I vetoed the budget of the Republican Congress when they tried to undo it all. And I believe a great university like Michigan State is entitled to be represented in the United States Congress by someone who believes in student loans, not someone who tries to abolish them. And I think you should make a change."", ""Folks, I've had a wonderful couple of days. Hillary and Chelsea and I started out on this train in West Virginia, and then Hillary went home to Chicago to start our convention, and Chelsea and I went through West Virginia, Kentucky, into Ohio. Then this morning in Toledo, Chelsea went to hear her mom speak tonight. And thank goodness, since we're a little late— I'm sorry we are, but I got to hear her mom speak tonight, too, on the train, and she was terrific. I was so proud of her."", ""And today we have been in Michigan. This train I'm taking across America is going across this heartland of our country for two reasons. For one thing, I really wanted to go to this convention to accept the nomination of my party for President for the second time, to begin the last campaign I'll ever make, by looking into the eyes, the faces, the hearts of the people of this country for whom I have worked and fought these last 4 years. And you have made me happy and pleased beyond my wildest dreams. I am proud to be an American when I look out at you and I see you. But I also wanted you to see this train, and I wanted you to see that it is on the right track, not just to Chicago, we're on the right track to the 21st century, and we intend to stay right on it."", ""Four years ago when I came to Michigan and I asked the people here to support me in the quest for the Presidency, I did it because it was a fight for the future, a future that most of you young people will have a lot more of than those of us who now have our AARP cards. [Laughter] I did it because I wanted to us to go into the next century with every American able to live up to the fullest of his or her Godgiven capacity, every American who's willing to work for it to have a chance to live his or her dreams. That, after all, is the great promise of this country. And I didn't like the fact that our country had high unemployment and stagnant wages and increasing division and unmet challenges and rising cynicism, especially among the young, about our political system. Well, 4 years later I can come back to you and I can say, I wanted to bring hope back to America. There is more hope, more progress, because we are better off than we were 4 years ago and we're going on the right track into the 21st century."", ""I have a simple formula, folks, for what I've been trying to do: more opportunity for people, more responsibility from our citizens, and a strong sense of American community. The special thing about this country is that we are bound together not by race or religion but by our shared values."", ""In the last 4 years, I have spent so much time as your President trying to make peace in other parts of the world. And we've made a lot of progress, but we've also got a lot of challenges out there, because it is so maddening to see from the Middle East to Bosnia, to Northern Ireland, to Rwanda and Burundi and other parts of the world how many places in the world are people determined to fight and kill each other because of their different races, their different religions, their different ethnicity, their different tribal roots. Why do people have to look down on each other who are different from them? In my America, if you believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence and you're willing to show up and be counted every day and be good law-abiding citizens, nothing else matters. We're going into the future together."", ""So I say to you, you look where we are on the question of opportunity, you look where we are on the question of people taking more responsibility, you look where we are on the question of coming together, and I say to you we're on the right track."", 'In the last 4 years—let me just mention a few things: We have 10 million more jobs. We have 4 1/2 million new homeowners. We have 10 million homeowners who have refinanced their mortgages at lower rates. We have 50 million Americans breathing cleaner air. We have cleaned up more toxic waste sites in 3 years than the previous administrations did in 12. We have 1 1/2 million fewer people on welfare. We have a 40 percent increase in child support payments. We have 2 million people now eligible for these direct student loans that you just heard about.', 'Just in the last week, look what happened. We raised the minimum wage for 10 million people. We gave the small-business people of this country a tax cut if they invest more in their business. And we made it easier for people to take out pensions for their employees. We made it easier for parents to adopt by giving a $5,000 tax credit for people who adopt a child, and even more if the child has a disability. There are so many kids out there who need a home. What we did in the minimum wage bill was pro-work, pro-family, and pro-business. It was a great day for America when we signed it.', ""And then we signed the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, which said to 25 million Americans, you can't lose your health insurance anymore if you lose your job, if you change jobs, or if somebody in your family has been sick. That's what health insurance is for. It was a great day for America."", 'Audience member. We love you!', ""The President. And so—you get the picture. We're moving in the right direction. Twelve million Americans have taken advantage of the family and medical leave law so they could take some time off without losing their job when a baby is born or a parent is sick. We're moving in the right direction. It didn't hurt the country."", ""I could go on and on and on. I am proud of the progress we have made. And I'm proud of some things that didn't happen, too. I want to balance the budget. I know that the things that we have done that have sparked this economic growth, perhaps more than anything else, is to drive the terrible deficit down. It's going to be your problem, the young people in this audience, if we don't do something about it."", ""When I became President, we had quadrupled the national debt in 12 years. The deficit was $290 billion and headed higher. Well, 4 years later, we've got it down to $116 billion, a 60 percent reduction. And those low interest rates—those low interest rates for all of you and your families, what do they mean? They mean more investment for more jobs. They mean lower payments for credit cards, for cars, for homes. They mean a stronger future."", 'And I want to balance the budget as much as the next person, and more than most, and I have a plan to do it. But when the Republicans in Congress sent me that plan that said, ""Take it or leave it, and if you don\'t take it we\'ll shut the Government down,"" I had to say no. I had to say no.', 'And I want to remind you again, when you make a decision about for whom to vote in the Senate race and the Congress race, I want to just remind you one more time about why I said no. Because that budget said, ""If you want a balanced budget, Mr. President, you have to agree to big cuts in education funding and limits on student loans and abolishing the AmeriCorps national service program. If you want a balanced budget, Mr. President, you have to agree to huge cuts in environmental investment, and undermining the ability of the American Government to protect clean air, clean water, and take us in the future. If you want a balanced budget, Mr. President, you have to agree to strip the Federal Government of the commitment we have made for 30 years to health care for the elderly in nursing homes, for middle class families with people with disabilities in them, for people who are very poor and pregnant, and for little kids.""', 'Last night when Christopher Reeve spoke at the Democratic Convention so movingly, one of the things that I remembered was my conversation with him in which he said, ""Mr. President, I\'m glad you didn\'t let them take Medicaid away because not everybody who gets hurt like I did has a good income like I had, and it can break anyone who is disabled."" We need to continue to keep faith with the values that made America strong and great and noble and good.', 'And so I ask you to go with me on to Chicago and into this campaign and into the next 4 years, because we still have a lot to do. We have challenges that are unmet. We have opportunities that are unseized. We have to keep the economy growing. We have to have the right kind of tax cut, one that we can afford and still balance the budget and not hurt the things we care about, and that is focused first and foremost on education.', ""I want to make 2 years of college as universal in 4 years as a high school education is today. I want to give a tax deduction for families for the cost of college tuition, any kind of education after high school, undergraduate or graduate, up to $10,000 a year and a $1,500 credit for those first 2 years. That's a good tax cut. That's a tax cut that we can pay for and a tax cut that will more than pay us back in a stronger, healthier, more vibrant America."", ""I want to see all the high schools in this country, every schoolroom, hooked up not only to computers, with trained teachers, but hooked up to the Internet, to that information superhighway that will allow the poorest schools in America access to the same information in the same time at the same quality as the richest schools in America. It has never happened in the history of this country. We're going to make it happen in the next 4 years."", 'I want to tell you that it\'s not just on economics that we\'ve made progress. The crime rate has been coming down for 4 years, but it is still too high. It has come down because we\'re putting 100,000 police on the street, because we\'re emphasizing prevention as well as tough punishment, because we banned assault weapons, and because we passed the Brady bill. And I want you to think about this: In Michigan, in Arkansas, some awful good people in 1994 lost their seats in Congress because they had the courage to vote for 100,000 police, a ban on assault weapons, and the Brady bill. They had the courage to vote for it, and many of their constituents were told, ""The Government is going to come take your gun away. They\'re going to stop you from hunting. They\'re going to stop you from going to the sporting contests.""', ""Well, folks, we've had two deer seasons in Michigan and two in Arkansas, and all our hunters still got the same rifles they started with. But 100,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers could not get handguns because of the Brady bill."", ""And now I say to you, we've got to keep this going. And every one of you young people, you might feel very safe tonight, you may feel very secure, but you want to bring your children into the world when you turn on the television news at night, if the lead story is a crime story, you're shocked, stunned, and surprised. Today, we take it for granted. We can change all that. We've got to keep that crime rate coming down. And I'll tell you how we're going to do it."", 'First of all, we ought to ban cop-killer bullets. I\'ve been trying to do it for 2 years. I hear the same thing. I want you young people to help us do that. I hear the same thing. They say, ""Oh, this is a slippery slope. Pretty soon they\'ll come get our ammunition."" I have never seen a deer in the woods with a bulletproof vest on. [Laughter] I\'m not trying to interfere with anybody\'s hunting. These bullets are designed to kill police officers, and they\'ll kill people, too, and we ought to ban them.', ""And then we ought to extend the Brady bill, in addition to felons, to incidents where violence is used in a domestic setting. If people commit domestic violence, they shouldn't be out there with guns where they can kill people in the family."", ""And finally let me say again—I want you to think about this when you vote for Congress— one of the reasons I vetoed that budget that they passed, one of the reasons I let them shut the Government down without caving in, is that the Congress sought to abolish—the Republican leadership sought to abolish our commitment to 100,000 police. Now, why in the world they were against it, I don't know. But they sought to abolish it once. They sought to do it again. And they're trying to restrict it today."", ""I'm telling you, folks, the way you make streets safer is to put police out there, let them get to know the kids, let them get to know the neighbors, let them get to know the reality of what's going on in the neighborhood, have people be friends and partners on the streets in making streets safe and stopping crime from happening. Keep the safe and drug-free schools program going. Get the law enforcement officers in there with the grade school kids, with the D.A.R.E. program and other things. Give these kids something to look forward to, something to be lifted up about. That is the key to the future, and I want you to help me do it. It's your future, your safety that is at stake, and I want you to help me fight for it."", 'I want you to help me fight for a clean environment. I don\'t want to see the proposals that were made in the last 2 years become law because there is not a President there to fight against them and to do good things. Now, we\'ve had some very good successes here since the people have raised up their voices and said, ""We don\'t like the weakening of the environment."" We just passed the Safe Drinking Water Act. We just passed a law to improve the safety of our food and reduce pesticides. And these are very, very good things. We just overhauled the meat inspection standards for the first time in 70 years; that\'s a good thing. But we\'ve got more to do. We need to clean up two-thirds of these toxic waste dumps in the next 4 years. We can do that. We need to continue to work to save our national parks. We saved Yellowstone from a gold mine; we need to save the Everglades. We need to stop the idea that we can sell our national parks. We need to build on our natural heritage. We need to build our environment.', ""Folks, you get the picture. We're better off than we were. We're on the right track. We've still got a lot to do. And it is your future."", ""The last thing I want to say is this: If you look around in this vast, wonderful, magnificent sea of people, you will see people whose ancestors came from all different places. When I went to see the Olympics and to start them off and I met with the American Olympic team, it made chills run up and down my spine. I thought to myself, if these kids didn't have the American uniform on and they were just walking out there in the Olympic Village, you wouldn't have a clue where they were from. You'd think, well, that person is on the African team and that one's on the Korean team and that one's on the Japanese team and that one's from the Caribbean somewhere and this one's from Latin America and the other one's from Europe and there's somebody from Scandinavia. You can be from anywhere and be American."", ""And I think one reason we like the Olympics is that everybody gets a chance, everybody plays by the rules, you don't get anywhere by badmouthing your opponent, you can't get a medal if you break your opponent's legs and break the rules. You just got to reach down deep and do the right thing. And even if you don't win, you're better off for having tried. That's the America I'm trying to build. That's the America I want you to have."", ""So I want you to think about it. I want you to think about it because we have to fight that. There are always, always going to be people that'll try to pit us against one another, look down on this group or that group or the other group. And we have to say no. We have to say no. If we share the same values and we're willing to show up and be law-abiding citizens, we've all got a role to play and all got a place in America of the 21st century. There is not a nation on Earth as well-positioned for the next century as the United States."", 'Many of you in this audience tonight will do jobs that have not been invented yet. Many of you will do things that have not been imagined yet. The best days of this country are still before us. You will have opportunities no previous generation of people have ever had in all of human history if—if—we all do our jobs to make opportunity available to everybody, to be good, responsible citizens and to realize that we have to do this together.', ""We are a great country when we are together. If we let people divide us and make us small and make us look down on one another, we will never reach our potential. But if you look around this sea of folks tonight and you say, they're all my brothers and sisters, we're all Americans, and we are still the greatest country in human history and our best days are still ahead, then they will be. Will you help me? Will you walk with me? Will you stay with me for 70 days and on for 4 years and on into the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'Thank you, and God bless you all. Good night. Thank you.']"
39,William J. Clinton ,"August 28, 1996","['The President. Thank you. Thank you. Wow! Thank you.', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', 'The President. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, citizens of Indiana and Michigan and Illinois. Thank you all for being here.', 'You know, folks, last night I called your Governor, Evan Bayh, to tell him two things. The first thing I said is, ""I loved your speech. Thank you for speaking for America and for what we did."" But the second thing I said was, ""You know, Evan, I was just in East Lansing, Michigan, and we had over 20,000 people there."" And I knew if I said that we\'d have 30,000 people in Michigan City today. And sure enough, we did.', ""Mayor Brillson, thank you for your welcome to the city, and thank you for your leadership. The mayor told me on the way in here that she'd only been mayor 8 months, but she is not only the mayor, she is the mother of six wonderful children who are down here. And I figure anybody who can raise six kids can do any job in America, including President. And I'm glad she's here."", ""You know, I was interested to hear the mayor say it's been 97 years since a President has been to Michigan City. All I can say is the rest of them didn't know what they were missing. I'm glad to be here. Thank you."", 'I thank your Congressman, Tim Roemer, for his leadership in the House of Representatives to prove that the Democratic Party can lead America into the future, that we can be responsible with your money, we can be strong for your economy, we can be tough on crime, but we can still have a heart for those who need the heart of America that are too often left behind and forgotten. Thank you, Tim Roemer.', ""I want to thank Lieutenant Governor Frank O'Bannon and his wife, Judy, for being here with me. And I want to tell you something, folks, each year the job of the Governor gets a little more important. If you watched our convention, you know there's a lot of discussion about the welfare reform bill that I signed. Let me tell you this. I want you to understand just how important this decision is for Governor in Indiana."", ""In the welfare reform bill, we said, look, we've reduced the welfare rolls by a million and a half by working with the States to move people from welfare to work. We think we can go all the way. We can take 800,000 kids and mothers off welfare tomorrow if we just got people to pay the child support they owe. And so we changed the law to do that. So we said, here is the new deal. We're going to have national protection for the medical care for poor people and their children. We're going to have national protection for the nutritional needs of poor people and their children. We're going to have a national program that guarantees child care so when people go to work, even if they're in lower wage jobs—from welfare to work—they won't have to worry about their kids. They'll be able to pay for child care. But we said, we're going to take the money that used to be in the check itself, the Federal and the State money, and give that money to the States, and then the States will have to design a program that will move people from welfare to work within 2 years."", ""Now, when you make this decision for Governor, there will be no question more important than who do you trust to really care about giving the people who have been trapped on welfare the same kind of life we want for all American families. We want people to succeed as parents and succeed as workers. Frank O'Bannon will do that, and I want you to give him the chance to do it."", ""Let me say, too, with some particular pride, that I have two people who work for me in the White House who come from near here. My military aide June Ryan, a lieutenant commander in the Coast Guard, whose parents live near South Bend, near here—that's not very far. I think they played football there, somebody told me. And one of my speechwriters, Carolyn Curiel's parents, Angela and Alex, live in Hammond. So I feel like I'm near home, at least, for them. Is anybody here from Hammond, Indiana? Yes, that's good."", ""Finally, let me say a special word of thanks to those who have participated to make me feel so welcome. There were 2,000 folks, I'll bet you, who met my train just across the river, so I'm going to count them in the mayor's crowd, or the Governor—they can fight over who got them here, but I was glad to see them. And on the way, the Michigan City ROTC High School Color Guard made me feel very welcome. I thank them."", ""I want to thank the Michigan City High School Band, who's playing over here. What a wonderful job they did. Thank you. I want to thank a teacher who is behind me, named Stacy Reisdorf. She and her eighth-grade class wrote me when I was coming. And I want to thank— look at all the students back there who made posters and who showed up, all the students from Michigan City. Thank you very much. I want to thank the National Guard for providing water. And if you need water, take it. I don't want anybody passing out here. I want you to be just hot enough to be excited but not any more."", 'And let me finally say, I know that there was an accident here earlier, and I want you to keep those folks in your prayers. As far as we know, they\'re okay, but we haven\'t gotten a final report. And let me also say to all of you, I don\'t think you can imagine what it means to me to see you out here, to see— when you read and you hear people say, ""Well, nobody believes in the political system anymore. People are cynical,"" and this, that and the other thing—I don\'t see any cynicism here. I see America and America\'s future, and I like what I see.', ""And while we're talking about the future——"", 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', 'The President. Thank you. Thank you.', ""Let me say one thing about the future, before I go on. I appreciated what Governor Bayh said about the relationship that he and Susan have had with Hillary and me. It's way beyond politics and beyond the fact that we're in the same party, beyond the fact that we served as Governors together for years. They are our friends, and they're two of the finest people I have ever met. You have been very fortunate to be served by them. I don't know what the future holds for them, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if someday Evan Bayh were to come back here to Michigan City as the President of the United States. And I'd like to see you out here for him."", ""Folks, we've had a lot of fun at our convention, but I've had just as much fun with America. A few days ago, Hillary and Chelsea and I went to Huntington, West Virginia, and then Hillary went on home to Chicago, and Chelsea and I started this train trip through West Virginia and Kentucky and Ohio and then into Michigan and, finally, here into Indiana."", ""And I took that train trip for two reasons. First of all, with an enormous sense of humility, I'm on my way to Chicago to accept the nomination of my party for the Presidency for the second time. It is——"", 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', 'The President. You know, unless I run for the school board or something some day, it will be the last race I ever make. And I wanted to take this trip through the heartland to look into the faces, the eyes, the hearts of the people that I ran for President to help, the people I have worked for and fought for for 4 years. And I have loved every mile of the track, all the people I have seen.', ""But I also wanted the American people to see, including all the people in all the little towns that came out to see the train come, all the school children standing by the road, all the people who put their pennies on the rails so the train would give them flat pennies— [laughter]—all the flags, even some of the loyal opposition that came, I wanted them all to see that we were not only on the right track to Chicago, we are on the right track to the 21st century. And that's the track we're going to stay on."", ""You know, I told you 4 years ago if you would hire me as President I would do my best to prepare this country for the next century. It's only 4 years away now. And I want us to go into that century with the American dream alive for every single person who is willing to work for it. I want us to go into that century with this country still the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity."", ""I want to go into that century—you look around this crowd today—where we can say other people in the world may be in the grips, the throes of division, other nations may be divided by race, by ethnicity, by tribe, by religion, but in America, if you believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, and you show up for work every day as a good citizen, you're our kind of American. We're all in this together. We're going forward together."", 'Well, now, you tell me—so I wanted to go out and see the people after 4 years. Four years ago, we had high unemployment, stagnant wages, a host of unmet social challenges. We had enormous growing cynicism, and we were afraid the middle class dreams that have always driven America were dying.', 'Four years later, we have 10 million new jobs, 4 1/2 million new homeowners, 10 million homeowners with lower mortgage rates, a record number of new small businesses, record exports, record businesses owned by women and minorities. America is on the move. For the first time in a decade, wages are on the rise again, for the first time in 10 years in the United States.', ""The crime rate has come down for 4 years in a row as we have given police officers and citizens at the local level the tools they need to make the most of their capacity for safe streets. We're putting 100,000 more police on the streets. We did pass the Brady bill, and 100,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers lost their handguns, but no hunters in Indiana or Arkansas did. We did the right thing."", ""We're investing more in safe and drug-free schools to try to put more of those D.A.R.E. officers in the schools and provide more education, more prevention, more treatment, as well as tougher punishment to keep our kids away from the problems that come with rising drug abuse. We have taken stands for the American family; 12 million American working families have been able to take a little time off from work for a baby's birth or a sick parent without losing their job. That's good for America."", 'We have moved aggressively to prove that you can clean up our environment and promote the public health and advance the economy by doing it. Fifty million Americans are breathing cleaner air. We cleaned up more toxic waste dumps in 3 years than were cleaned up in 12 years. We are moving to protect the American environment and grow the American economy. And we can do both.', ""And we have done this in a way that brings the American people together. We have faced a lot of tough challenges around the world, and I've had to do some things that were, frankly, unpopular with a majority of you. But because we went in to Bosnia with our allies, no soldier has fallen in combat so far there, but the slaughter has ended and the people at least are being given a chance to get over the madness of their ethnic hatreds and go on with civilized life and be a part of a free Europe and a free world. And because we have worked with the Russians to be free, to promote their democracy, to promote their economy, to get their troops out of other countries, to be a constructive partner, for the first time since nuclear weapons were developed, in the last 4 years, there is not a single nuclear weapon pointed at an American child anywhere in this country, and I am proud of that."", ""And let me say again how much I appreciated what Tim Roemer said and what Evan Bayh said about that budget battle I had with the Congress. Folks, I always wanted to balance the budget. I was a Governor for 12 years before I was President. I had 12 balanced budgets. I couldn't believe we quadrupled the debt of this country in just 12 years. I want you to know that tonight not only have we cut the deficit by 60 percent, your budget would have a surplus tonight if it weren't for the interest we pay on the debt run up in the 12 years before I became President. Let's don't go back and repeat that mistake again. Let's keep on going. Let's keep on going until we finish the job."", ""You know, every time an election rolls around they say the public doesn't really care about the deficit, it's an abstract concept. Let me tell you something, it's not abstract. It's not only whether we're going to saddle all these kids with a debt they can't pay, if you bring the deficit down the way we have, that brings interest rates down. What does that mean when interest rates come down? It means your house payment, you car payment, your credit card payment goes down, Even more important, maybe, it means business people can go borrow money, invest it in businesses, and create new jobs. That's why we have over 10 million new jobs, because we've got a healthy climate to invest and to grow and to move this country forward."", ""Now, folks, that's the record; that's the past. But we've got more to do. We've got to keep going until every single citizen in this country who is willing to work for it has a chance to participate in the American dream. We've got to keep going until all our streets are so safe that if you come home at night and turn on the evening news and the lead story is a crime story, you are shocked instead of numb to it. That's when we'll know we have the crime problem whipped."", ""We've got to keep going until every single one of our children can read well by the third grade, until every single one of our teenagers know that drugs are dangerous. They're not only illegal, they will kill you. We have got to turn that around. We've got to keep going until we solve the problems of America and take everybody into the 21st century—everybody."", 'We\'ve got to keep going until every American believes that we cannot afford to look down on one another. That\'s why I took such a strong stand against these church burnings and why I lash out every time a synagogue or an Islamic center is defaced and why I was appalled when those African-American Special Forces personnel in North Carolina came home to find swastikas painted on their doors. I bet you we\'ve got some former Special Forces people in this crowd today. I\'ll tell you what they are, they\'re special forces. That means tonight at midnight, if I wake them up and I tell them to go halfway around the world to put their lives on the line and defend you, they will do it and say, ""Yes sir,"" and be glad to go. They do not deserve to have swastikas put on their doors. We\'ve got to keep going until that is not a problem anymore. We\'ve got to keep going.', ""There are 25 million Americans who were helped last week when we signed the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill to say you can't lose your health insurance if you got sick or if you change jobs. But we've got to keep going until unemployed families, when they lose their jobs, get a little help so they can actually afford to keep their health insurance."", ""We've got to keep going until small-business people in this country can not only afford to invest in their business—because we've given every single one of them a tax cut if they invest more in their business in the last 4 years— we've got to keep going until small-business people can actually afford those health insurance policies that the rest of us enjoy, for their employees and themselves."", ""We raised the minimum wage for 10 million Americans last week, but we've got to keep going. We've got to keep going until every American has access to a good education that will lift all our income. That's why I say we ought to have a family-friendly targeted tax cut that we can afford that focuses on giving the American people the ability to take out IRA that they can save for with a family income up to $100,000 and then withdraw from to pay for a college education, to pay for a first home, to pay for medical insurance. That's the kind of tax cut we need."", 'We ought to give families a tax deduction for the cost of college tuition, a tax credit for a community college education for 2 years so everybody in America can have 2 years of education after high school. We can afford that. We can balance the budget. It will make us a stronger country.', 'I want you to support that. I want you to support 4 more years, not just of Bill Clinton and Al Gore, I want you to support 4 more years of more opportunity, more responsibility, and more community. I want you to support the idea that when the year 2000 comes around we will go roaring into the 21st century as the greatest nation in the world, with our best days before us.', 'Will you help me for the next 70 days? Will you stand with us for 4 more years? Will you talk to your friends and neighbors and ask them to go forward with us? [Applause]', 'Thank you. God bless you. On to Chicago. Thank you.']"
40,William J. Clinton ,"August 28, 1996","[""The President. Thank you. Thank you very much. I want to thank the people over across the street—we know you're there; we're glad you're here. Thank you. I would like to thank Kathy Bloch for her introduction and for the work she's done to support our efforts to stop the marketing, the advertising, and the distribution and the sales of tobacco to young people. That's not legal, and it ought to stop. Three thousand of our young people a day start to smoke, and 1,000 of them will die sooner because of it. It's the biggest public health problem in the country, and I think it's a good thing that Americans have taken action on it again, thanks largely to people like Kathy Bloch and young people themselves who have asked us to help them protect a healthy future for them, and I thank her for it. Thank you, Mark Schauer, for your work and your candidacy. Thank you, Kim Tunnicliff; I thought you gave a good, rousing speech."", ""I thought to myself when I heard Kim talking, now, if he'd been in Congress, that would have been one more vote against that budget that slashed Medicare by $270 billion and took away the guarantee of health care to the elderly in nursing homes, to poor children, to pregnant mothers, and to families with members with disabilities. He would have stopped that."", 'He would not have voted to cut education and the environment or to raise taxes on the lowest income working people or to let $15 billion be taken out of worker pension funds. All that was in that budget in 1995 that I vetoed. And I never did hear our friends in San Diego talking about that when they were bragging about how moderate and nice and broadminded they were. So I was glad to hear Kim remind you that there was a budget battle last year. I did veto it, and thanks to Carl Levin and others, we sustained that veto. It would be a good thing to have somebody in the Congress that wanted to balance the budget and protect our values. I thank you for doing that, sir.', ""I would like to introduce another Michigan Congressman who's here with me. He represents the Upper Peninsula, and I think he is one of the most dedicated, upright, hardworking people in the Congress: Congressman Bart Stupak and his wife are both here. Congressman Stupak, come out here and wave to the folks. Governor Jim Blanchard is here, who was the very distinguished Ambassador to Canada. I thank you, Governor Blanchard. Attorney General Frank Kelley is here. I thank you, Frank, for coming and for your work. Frank Garrison, the head of the Michigan AFL-CIO is here with us. And I want to say a very special word of thanks to another son of Michigan who is here, who just completed his term as the president of the National Education Association, Keith Geiger, who was a fearless and wonderful advocate for America's teachers. Thank you, Keith Geiger, for being here."", ""Finally, I'd like to thank Senator Carl Levin for his leadership for Michigan and America, for his fight for America's jobs and his fight for ethics in Government, for his fight to give America the kind of direction that it needs and deserves. He deserves your reelection for his service, and I hope you'll give it to him."", ""I'd like to thank the Battle Creek High Band. Thank you very much for being here. And I thank the saxophone selection for raising your horns. You look good over there. Well, the rest of you can raise your horns; you don't have to be a saxophone player."", ""I thank Mayor Deering, from Battle Creek, and the principal of Battle Creek High School, Bruce Barney; the head of the local community action agency, Sherry Keys-Hebron; the president of the AFL-CIO for south central Michigan, Richard France; Reverend Albert Thomas; and all the others who had anything to do with this event today, including the Washington Heights Gospel Ministry, who'll give us music at the end of this event. Thank you all very much."", ""Folks, I'm glad to be the first President in Battle Creek since President Johnson was here in 1965. I'm glad to be the first President to come into Battle Creek on a train since President Taft was here in 1911."", 'This train started in West Virginia and went into Kentucky. Then we went all over Ohio. Yesterday morning, we started in Toledo and then worked our way into Michigan to Wyandotte to Royal Oak to Pontiac and last night to a rally at Michigan State University where there were over 20,000 people. It was an amazing event.', ""I took this train to Chicago, the 21st Century Express, for two reasons. First of all, I wanted to get a chance, as I go to Chicago to accept the nomination of my party for President and begin the last and perhaps the most important campaign of my life, to look into the faces, into the eyes, into the hearts of the people of America in the heartland for whom I have worked and fought these last 4 years. I wanted to see you to remember why we're doing all this."", ""And secondly, I wanted to make the point that our train is not only on the right track to Chicago, it's on the right track to the 21st century. And we need to stay on that track. But as one of these wonderful signs said, there is more to do. I was very proud of my wife last night at the Democratic Convention because she talked about the work she's done for the last 25 years, what we learned about it from raising our own daughter, and the fact that there is more to do."", 'Audience members. Hillary in 2000!', ""The President. Let me say very briefly—I want to speak with you, and I want to ask you to do something for me. I want you to vote for me, of course. I want you to stay with us. But I want to talk to you just a few moments this morning about what we've done and where we're going and ask you to spend the next 70 days talking to your friends and neighbors about it."", ""I ran for President 4 years ago because I wanted to lead our country into the 21st century with all Americans having the chance to live out their dreams. I ran for President because I didn't like the fact that we had high unemployment, stagnant wages. We were not meeting our challenges, cynicism was on the rise, middle class dreams were being dashed, and I knew we could do better. I knew we could do better."", ""So I went before the American people and said, I have a simple strategy. I want to create a country in which there is opportunity for everyone, responsibility from everyone, and where everyone who is willing to work hard and do the right thing without regard to their race, their gender, where they come from, or anything else about them. If you believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, you're part of my America, and you're going to be part of our America in the future."", ""Well, we've been at this for 4 years now, and the people can make a judgment. And they can also listen to the ideas we have for the future and know there's a darn good chance we can implement them because we've done so much of what we talked about 4 years ago."", 'On the economy we had a simple strategy: get the deficit down, bring the interest rates down, give tax relief to the people who need it most, expand our sales of American products around the world, invest in science and technology and, most important of all, in the education of our people.', ""Now, has it worked? Compared to 4 years ago, we have over 10 million new jobs, a record number of small businesses, including businesses owned by women and minorities. We have a 15-year high in homeownership. We have an all-time high in the export of American products. We have an all-time high in the creation of American small businesses. I can tell you, for the first time in a decade—maybe most important of all to me—average wages are on the rise again. We've been waiting for 10 years to see that start."", ""The other party always talked about being against the deficit in Government, but in the previous 12 years we increased the debt by 4 times. Since I've been President, we've cut the deficit in each of the last 4 years. It's down by 60 percent. Interest rates are down, investments are up, and the economy is growing. Tell your friends and neighbors in Battle Creek and around this area that we would have a surplus in the budget today and we could have a bigger tax cut if it weren't for the interest we're having to pay on the debt that was run up in the 12 years before I took office. We'd have a surplus."", ""But we have to do more. We can grow this economy faster, we can create more jobs, we can raise incomes more if we will work hard together. We have to go on and balance the budget to keep the interest rates down, but we have to do it in a way that is different from what our friends in the opposition tried to do last year. We do not have to destroy Medicare or Medicaid or turn our backs on education and the environment or do anything to let the stability of working people's pension funds be eroded. We can balance the budget and protect our values, and that is my commitment to you."", ""We can also cut taxes for families in America, but the tax cuts need to be targeted to what will do the most good and to something we can pay for, and people like me, who don't need it, shouldn't get them, because we have to balance the budget. We have to balance the budget and cut taxes, and we can do both."", 'The tax cut should be targeted. We should give a $500-a-child credit for children under 13. We should give people the right to save in an IRA with incomes going up to—family incomes of $100,000, and then withdraw that money, those savings, without any penalty if they need it for health care, to buy a first-time home, or to pay for a college education. We ought to do that.', 'We should continue to invest in education. We ought to have a million children in Head Start. We ought to have a million kids working their way through college on work-study. We ought to preserve my lower cost college loan program, not do away with it as the other party tried to do. And we ought to give people a tax deduction for the cost of college tuition up to $10,000 a year and a tax credit worth $1,500, an outright credit, to make sure every person in America can get at least 2 years of education after high school. It ought to be as universal as a high school education is today. We ought to make sure that every classroom in America not only has computers and trained teachers but is hooked up to the information superhighway by the year 2000, every single classroom.', ""Now, folks, if you're my age and you're not the most computer-literate person in the world, it may be hard to understand what that means. But let me tell you what it means. It means that we now have the chance, for the first time in the history of the United States of America, to make sure that children in the poorest urban classroom, children in the remotest mountain village in America, children in the high plains of the West, children everywhere will have access to the same high quality information in the same time in the same understandable form that children in the wealthiest, best schools in America do. That has never happened before. That is revolutionary."", ""So that's our opportunity agenda. We also need to continue to fight for responsibility. But look where we are compared to 4 years ago: The crime rate is down, the welfare rolls are down 1 1/2 million, and child support collections are up 40 percent. We're moving in the right direction. Not a single Michigan hunter lost a weapon when the Brady bill passed, even though that's what our friends in the opposition were saying in 1994 to get votes. I don't know why they didn't repeat that in San Diego; I was listening. [Laughter] No, nobody lost a weapon in Michigan, but 100,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers have not been able to get handguns because the Brady bill passed."", ""We're halfway home in putting those 100,000 police on the street. And we have increased funding for safe and drug-free schools and for prevention programs and, I might add, at a time when about the only thing in this country that is not going in the right direction, I'm sad to say, is teenage tobacco and drug use; they've both been going up the last 4 years. I don't think this is a very good time to try to abolish our drug-free schools program. We need more D.A.R.E. officers in those schools. We need more people in those schools trying to keep the kids off drugs in the first place."", ""But we've got more to do. Very briefly, I think we ought to ban cop-killer bullets. Police officers are—[inaudible]—of them. No deer in the Michigan woods is wearing a Kevlar vest. Our police officers are. We ought to protect them, and they deserve it. And I think if you commit an act of domestic violence, you also shouldn't be eligible to get another handgun where you can kill somebody."", ""And I do not believe that we should stop putting 100,000 police on the street. We're halfway home; we need to finish the job. I don't know why our friends are interested in killing the 100,000-police program, but I do know this: More police on the streets, working with their friends and neighbors, knowing the kids, prevent crime in the first place and make it safer. We've got 4 years of a declining crime rate. We know what works. Four more years, and it will be about where it ought to be. Let's keep on going."", ""In the area of welfare reform, let me just say this. If every person in this country who owes child support paid it, 800,000 women and children would go off welfare tomorrow. We have to keep doing better with that. Now that we have passed the welfare reform legislation, we have guaranteed child care and health care and nutrition to poor children and their families. But if you're going to tell people they've got to be at work within 2 years, they have to have jobs that they can attend. So we now have to create jobs for these people. It is wrong to cut people off and put the kids in the street unless people have jobs as an alternative, and I am committed to that. So that's our responsibility agenda."", ""Now let me talk a little about what binds us together as a community. First of all, it's our families. Look where we are compared to 4 years ago. Twelve million American families have taken advantage of the family and medical leave law that we passed with the help of people like Carl Levin and Bart Stupak and over the opposition of the leaders of the other party. Twelve million Americans took a little time off when there was a baby born or a sick parent, and it didn't hurt the economy a bit. We're better off because of it."", ""And now we just raised the minimum wage for 10 million people. We just made 90 percent of our small businesses eligible for a tax cut if they invest more in the business and made it easier for people in small businesses, where most Americans work, to take out retirement for themselves and their employees and to keep those retirement plans if they change jobs. That's pro-family. And we adopted in the small business bill, in the minimum wage bill, a $5,000 tax credit for people who adopt a child, more if the child has a disability. There are hundreds of thousands of kids out there that need a good home. I hope more people will adopt now that we have passed this law."", 'In the area of health care we adopted the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill. You know what it says to 25 million Americans? ""Okay, now they can\'t take your health insurance away from you just because somebody in your family has been sick, or if you lose your job or you change jobs you still have a right to keep your health insurance."" It can help 25 million of our fellow citizens. That\'s pro-family.', ""What we're doing in implementing this rule on tobacco is pro-family. We don't say—we say to adults, you have a right to smoke; you do what you want. It's a legal product. But it's illegal in every State in America to market or sell tobacco products to children, and we're going to do our best to stop it because we want our kids to live longer. That's pro-family."", ""But we have to do more. On health care, we should make it possible for unemployed people not only to keep their insurance as a matter of law but to afford it. My balanced budget plan helps unemployed people keep their health insurance for 6 months. Our balanced budget plan helps families with members with Alzheimer's they're caring for get some respite care. Our balanced budget plan says, among other things, that a mother cannot be forced to leave a hospital in sooner than 48 hours after a baby is born. And I think we have to build on the family and medical leave law. I think we ought to let people have just a little time off—not a lot, no time for abuse—but a little time off not only for a medical emergency, not only for the birth of a child but to take their children to regular doctor's appointments and to see the teacher once in a great while."", ""We can't be a strong community unless we have a strong environment. Fifty million Americans are breathing cleaner air than 4 years ago. We've cleaned out more toxic waste dumps in the last 3 years than in the previous 12. We passed the Safe Drinking Water Act, the pesticide protection act. We upgraded the standards for safe meat and poultry. We're moving in the right direction, but we have to do more. And I'll be saying more about this later today, but we need to clean up at least two-thirds of the toxic waste dumps in this country in the next 4 years. We have delayed it long enough."", ""Let me say again, we have to do these things consistent with our values. We will not be one community if in the name of balancing the budget we give a tax cut that requires us to cut Medicare, stop Medicaid's commitment to families with members with disabilities. I thought Christopher Reeve was so moving at the Democratic Convention the other night. But let me tell you, he's right about research. We're going to spend more on research, $1 billion more, because it's important. We have doubled the life expectancy for people with AIDS or HIV infection in just the last 4 years, doubled it because of research. We may be able to extend their lives indefinitely in good, quality ways because of research."", 'We are about to build a computer with IBM, a supercomputer, because of research, that will do more calculations in a minute than a person with a hand-held calculator could do in 30,000 years. That is what we\'re getting out of research. He\'s right. But he\'s also right—when Christopher Reeve said to me—and I thank these people here for coming to be with us today— Christopher Reeve said, ""You know, you\'ve got to make that fight on Medicaid. You can\'t let them take away Medicaid because not everybody who gets hurt like me has been an actor, has made a good living. And even people like me can go broke. Middle class families deserve the right to keep working and caring for their family members.""', ""So, folks, if you believe we're all in this fight together, if you agree with the First Lady that it takes a village and we're all part of it, if you believe that America's best days are ahead, if you want to stay on the right track to the 21st century, will you help us for the next 70 days?"", 'Audience members.

Thank you all for being here.', ""I want to thank my good friend Senator Carl Levin for being here today and supporting the environment in general and for being America's number one fighter for the Great Lakes and uniform quality standards for the Great Lakes water. By the way, I'm sure you all know we've still got some work to do on that, so we can use 6 more years of Carl Levin to finish our work on the Great Lakes."", 'I want to thank Katie McGinty, the Chair of our Environmental Council in the White House.

And I looked at him, and I said, ""Now, Dan, are you 10?"" He said, ""Well, I\'m almost 10."" [Laughter] Well, I\'m almost 49, too—[laughter]—in the reverse direction. There aren\'t many young people his age who could have spoken so well and so forcefully. Didn\'t he do a good job? Thank you very, very much, Dan.

Leaving you, I'm going on now to Michigan City, Indiana, and then I will fly to Chicago. I've been on this train for two reasons. First, I wanted to see people like you in the heartland of America, the people that really make this country go, the people I've been working for and fighting for for 4 years. But I also wanted to make the point that our train and our country are both on the right track to the 21st century."", 'For 4 years, I have pursued a very straightforward strategy based on a vision of what our country ought to be like. When all these children who are in this audience spend most of their life in a new century, the world will be so different from the world people my age grew up in, different in how we work and live and relate to each other, very different in how we relate to the rest of the world, vastly, vastly increased opportunities and significant new challenges. And I want us to go into that next century with every child in this country having the opportunity to live up to his or her God-given potential and live out their dreams. And I believe you want that, too.', ""In order to do that, our country has to create more opportunity and receive more responsibility from all of our citizens. That's the basic bargain of America. Our country has to remain the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity. And I appreciate what Mary said about our role in the world. It's important for America to lead the world. It's important for Americans that we do. And most of all, our country has to come together as one community."", 'All over the world—this morning, as I do every morning, I started my work day with a review of the situation in the rest of the world. And I thought to myself, how much time have I spent as President dealing with problems created because other people could not get along and because they insisted on looking down on people that lived on the same piece of land they did because they had a different race, a different ethnic group, a different religion, they were of a different tribe? It happens in Africa and Rwanda and Burundi. It has consumed the Middle East for decades. It has consumed Northern Ireland for longer than that. It has rooted and caused butchery and slaughter in Bosnia we have worked so hard to end.', ""Why do people do this? What is special about America? We say, this is not a country about race. This is not a country about religion. This is a country where, if you believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, if you are willing to show up tomorrow and be a good citizen, it doesn't matter whatever else is special or unique or different about you; we're stronger for your difference; we're going forward together. And we have to have that commitment."", 'Now, we manifest that commitment in many different ways. I was so moved at our convention in Chicago when Christopher Reeve talked about his tragic accident and his determination to overcome it. And he reminded us that we not only have to continue to invest in research to try to find answers to the problems that beset us, we also need to deal humanely and decently with people who have difficulties.', 'Christopher Reeve came to see me in the White House, and he said, ""Mr. President, I am so glad you fought to stop Congress from destroying the Medicaid program and ending its guarantee to the elderly in nursing homes, to poor children, and to people who have disabilities, because not everybody who gets a disability is a wealthy person. And even wealthy people can be driven into poverty. And if it weren\'t for Medicaid, middle class families wouldn\'t be able to maintain their lifestyles."" That\'s a part of our community.', ""I have to tell you, when Tipper Gore was talking last night, I was proud of the fact that my friend and the Vice President's wife has spoken up for 20 years to try to protect our children from unhealthful, indeed, affirmatively harmful cultural influences that will make it more difficult for them to be successful people. That's a part of our community, trying to make it more possible for parents to transmit their own values, not somebody else's commercially driven values, to the children of our country. I was proud of that."", ""And I was proud when my wife spoke last night at the convention and pointed out that we have been very fortunate in our lives. We've always had jobs where we could take time off when Chelsea needed us, but other working families need that same time off."", ""We've always had the best sort of health insurance. And I was there when Chelsea was born in the delivery room and when we took her home, but Hillary had the need to stay in the hospital a little extra time. And it's wrong for women and their newborn babies to be thrown out of the hospital after a day if they're not ready to go home. They ought to be able to stay longer. That's a part of our community."", ""We've had a good week in Washington right before we left for this convention. A lot of things were done that will create more opportunity, give us a chance to have more responsibility, and bring us together in a community. The minimum wage went up for 10 million people. Ninety percent of the small businesses in this country got a tax cut. We made it possible for people in small businesses to save for their retirement and for employees in small businesses to keep their retirement when they move from job to job. That's all important."", 'We gave people a tax credit of $5,000—and more if there is a disability involved—if they will adopt children. There are hundreds of thousands of children out there in this country that need good homes. We did that. That was good.', ""We made 25 million Americans safer in their health care because we said you can't be denied health insurance anymore just because somebody in your family has been sick or because you changed jobs. That was a good thing for America."", 'We also passed the Safe Drinking Water Act and the pesticide protection act to help improve the public health and the environment. And that was a great thing for America.', ""That's what I've come here to talk to you about today. We cannot go forward together as a country, a country where it works for all of us, unless we have a shared commitment to protect the environment. And unless we want to protect everybody's environment, in the end, no matter how wealthy and powerful we are, the quality of our lives will be undermined."", '[At this point, an audience member required medical attention.]', ""The President. Do you need a doctor over there? Are you okay? Over here? Where's my medical team? We've got to have somebody."", ""Now, you think about that. It doesn't matter—I don't care if you have got a billion dollars, if you live in America, in the end, the quality of your life will be undermined unless we save the environment for everybody. We all have an interest in clean air and safe water and safe food and in preserving our national treasures."", ""I can tell you this, compared to 4 years ago, there are tens of millions of people in America breathing cleaner air. We've cleaned up more toxic waste sites in 3 years than the previous administrations did in 12."", 'We have revamped the meat and poultry inspection standards of this country for the first time in literally decades. We are moving in the right direction. We saved our national parks from an ill-advised congressional attempt to sell off some of them and underfund them. And that was a good thing.', ""We saved Yellowstone, our Nation's first and great national treasure as a park, from the ravages of mining. And we are determined to do the same thing and save the Everglades in Florida. That's important to all of us."", ""We have kicked dozens and dozens of dangerous chemicals out of the marketplace and quickly replaced them with safer substitutes. We have increased community's right to know about what is in their community and what kinds of chemicals they are exposed to."", ""All these things are important, and they matter. And we're better off because of them. We've also changed the way we do a lot of our environmental work. We've streamlined rules and regulations, challenged businesses and communities to come together and stop fighting. We've emphasized results, not punishments and regulations. We are proving that you don't have to choose between a healthy environment and a healthy economy."", 'In Michigan, we have worked very closely with the autoworkers in the Big Three to develop a clean car that will get 3 times the mileage of the average car today for the 21st century in a way that will put money in the pockets of American consumers, increase the quality of our environment, and maintain the dominance of our auto industry in the world for decades to come. If we can succeed in the clean car, it will be a major step forward for the cleanness of our environment and for the security of the work right here in Michigan.', ""But we have more to do. You all know we have more to do. You heard Mary's story of the work that is represented by this beautiful water behind us. And you know that a lot of these battles are won block by block, day by day. Carl Levin has been working on the Great Lakes for a very long time, block by block, day by day, not just lake by lake, section by section. This is hard work. And we have more to do."", ""I want an America, in the year 2000, where no child should have to live near a toxic waste dump, where no parent should have to worry about the safety of a child's glass of water, and no neighborhood should be put in harm's way by pollution from a nearby factory."", 'Today I am calling for a new national commitment to help protect all communities from toxics by the year 2000. First, I am determined that finally we clean up the toxic waste sites that scar our landscape and threaten our neighborhoods.', ""When I came into office, I vowed to strengthen and improve the Superfund's cleanups. In the last 3 years—in the last 3 years, not counting this year—we have cleaned up 197 toxic waste sites, more than in the previous 12 years. We're doing 3 times more a year than were done before."", ""And we have done it while reducing the costs of these cleanups. The Kalamazoo River here is going to be cleaned up by polluters under your State's Superfund law. And some of the cleanup has not begun. But we have to keep working on this. We cannot slow down. We need to speed up the pace. These Superfund sites have been out there too long. And the longer they're there, the more danger there is that damage will be done. We must speed up the pace."", ""I am here in Michigan because 10 million American children under the age of 12 live within 4 miles of a toxic waste dump. And an exceptional percentage of the children who live there are children from the State of Michigan. Michigan has more at stake in this initiative than any other State, but every State's children are affected by our success. We must press ahead."", ""Today we must commit our Nation's willpower and resources to meet a clear goal. In the next 4 years, we will clean up another 500 toxic waste sites, nearly double the pace of the Superfund cleanups. And by the year 2000, we will clean up two-thirds—the two-thirds worst toxic waste dumps in the country. We will get them out of the neighborhoods where the children live. We will do it."", '[An audience member required medical attention.]', 'The President. We need another medical team over here. We need some water and my medical team over here, wherever they are. Here we go.', 'Let me also say that our cities are full of what we call brownfields, urban toxic waste sites. We have proved that they can be cleaned up and turned into homes for safe businesses that create jobs in areas that thought that they would never get any new jobs again. The most important thing that I am working on with the mayors of America today is cleaning up these brownfields so we can create jobs in the city. Again I tell you, good environmental policy is good for the economy. It creates jobs. It creates a future for America, and we have to be prepared to do it.', ""We must bring the full force of law to bear on polluters who are willfully jeopardizing the safety of our people. I am going to send to Congress an environmental crimes bill to make it a crime to attempt to pollute, that will give us the power to catch polluters before they poison the land. The bill will increase penalties for those who intentionally pump toxics into our neighborhoods where our children will be exposed. And it will enable us to hit polluters where it hurts. It will give prosecutors the power to freeze polluters' assets and require them to clean up their messes. That is perhaps the most important thing of all."", ""We're also going to expand our community right-to-know law to make more information, practical information, available to families easier and faster. Right-to-know will protect you here in communities like Kalamazoo because you can find out what's dangerous to your families. Once there is a right-to-know law, companies think twice about what they do. In the decades since we've passed the first one, businesses have reported reducing toxic emission by 43 percent. Right-to-know works. Don't be fooled about it; it makes a big difference."", 'I have ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to give local environmental information to communities—including putting it on-line where it will be handy to computers—in one place by the year 2000, so that a parent could go to the local library or go to a school or just turn on a computer and immediately find out the chemicals in your community to which your children are exposed. That is a powerful early warning system, and it will help grassroots environmental activism clean the environment even more.', ""Finally, let me say, we have to take further steps to stop toxics from getting into our drinking water. I signed an Executive order that directs every Federal agency that's appropriate to join in our effort to crack down on those who would poison the waters and make them pay to clean it up. I want to see to it that Congress fully funds the Safe Drinking Water Act we just signed into law last month."", ""And in particular, I've made a commitment in my balanced budget plan to work with Carl Levin and others to continue to improve the quality of the Great Lakes. We've worked hard to carry out the Great Lakes water quality initiative, which Senator Levin did so much to bring about, and we'll keep right on doing it."", ""We are blessed with magnificent natural resources. Every time our family goes on vacation in a National Park, I thank God again for the good fortune of being an American and for all the blessings we've been given just by the grace of God. But I'll tell you, we've been given it; it's up to us to do the right things with it."", ""We have learned some fundamental things. Not only do you not have to hurt the economy to protect the environment—what difference does it make if you have money if you don't have clean water, clean air, a good natural environment, safe food, and a good public health system?"", ""And finally, we now know that this is not a negative thing. We now know that one of the most effective ways to create good, highwage jobs in the 21st century is to invest in research, in technology, and in protecting the environment. That is the direction we're going to take, and that will keep us right on track for the 21st century."", 'Thank you, and God bless you. Thank you.']"

We have the lowest combined rates of unemployment, inflation, and home mortgages in 28 years. Look at what happened: 10 million new jobs, over half of them high-wage jobs; 10 million workers getting the raise they deserve with the minimum wage law; 25 million people now having protection in their health insurance because the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill says you can't lose your insurance anymore when you change jobs, even if somebody in your family has been sick; 40 million Americans with more pension security; a tax cut for 15 million of our hardest working, hardest pressed Americans, and all small businesses; 12 million Americans—12 million of them—taking advantage of the family and medical leave law so they can be good parents and good workers. Ten million students have saved money on their college loans. We are making our democracy work."", ""We have also passed political reform, the line item veto, the motor voter bill, tougher registration laws for lobbyists, making Congress live under the laws they impose on the private sector, stopping unfunded mandates to State and local government. We've come a long way; we've got one more thing to do. Will you help me get campaign finance reform in the next 4 years? [Applause] Thank you."", ""We have increased our investments in research and technology. We have increased investments in breast cancer research dramatically. We are developing a supercomputer—a supercomputer that will do more calculating in a second than a person with a hand-held calculator can do in 30,000 years. More rapid development of drugs to deal with HIV and AIDS and moving them to the market quicker have almost doubled life expectancy in only 4 years. And we are looking at no limit in sight to that. We'll keep going until normal life is returned to people who deal with this."", ""Our country is still the strongest force for peace and freedom on Earth. On issues that once before tore us apart, we have changed the old politics of Washington. For too long, leaders in Washington asked who's to blame. But we asked, what are we going to do?"", 'On crime, we\'re putting 100,000 police on the streets. We made ""three strikes and you\'re out"" the law of the land. We stopped 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers from getting handguns under the Brady bill. We banned assault rifles. We supported tougher punishment and prevention programs to keep our children from drugs and gangs and violence. Four years now— for four years now—the crime rate in America has gone down.', 'On welfare, we worked with States to launch a quiet revolution. Today there are 1.8 million fewer people on welfare than there were the day I took the oath of office. We are moving people from welfare to work.', 'We have increased child support collections by 40 percent. The Federal work force is the smallest it has been since John Kennedy. And the deficit has come down for 4 years in a row for the first time since before the Civil War, down 60 percent on the way to zero. We will do it.', ""We are on the right track to the 21st century. We are on the right track, but our work is not finished. What should we do? First, let us consider how to proceed. Again I say, the question is no longer who's to blame but what to do."", 'I believe that Bob Dole and Jack Kemp and Ross Perot love our country, and they have worked hard to serve it. It is legitimate, even necessary, to compare our record with theirs, our proposals for the future with theirs. And I expect them to make a vigorous effort to do the same. But I will not attack. I will not attack them personally or permit others to do it in this party if I can prevent it. [Applause] Thank you. My fellow Americans, this must be—this must be—a campaign of ideas, not a campaign of insults. The American people deserve it.', ""Now, here's the main idea. I love and revere the rich and proud history of America, and I am determined to take our best traditions into the future. But with all respect, we do not need to build a bridge to the past; we need to build a bridge to the future. And that is what I commit to you to do."", 'So tonight, tonight let us resolve to build that bridge to the 21st century, to meet our challenges and protect our values. Let us build a bridge to help our parents raise their children, to help young people and adults to get the education and training they need, to make our streets safer, to help Americans succeed at home and at work, to break the cycle of poverty and dependence, to protect our environment for generations to come, and to maintain our world leadership for peace and freedom. Let us resolve to build that bridge.', 'Tonight, my fellow Americans, I ask all of our fellow citizens to join me and to join you in building that bridge to the 21st century. Four years from now, just 4 years from now—think of it—we begin a new century, full of enormous possibilities. We have to give the American people the tools they need to make the most of their God-given potential. We must make the basic bargain of opportunity and responsibility available to all Americans, not just a few. That is the promise of the Democratic Party. That is the promise of America.', 'I want to build a bridge to the 21st century in which we expand opportunity through education, where computers are as much a part of the classroom as blackboards, where highly trained teachers demand peak performance from our students, where every 8-year-old can point to a book and say, ""I can read it myself.""', 'By the year 2000, the single most critical thing we can do is to give every single American who wants it the chance to go to college. We must make 2 years of college just as universal in 4 years as a high school education is today. And we can do it. We can do it, and we should cut taxes to do it.', ""I propose a $1,500-a-year tuition tax credit for Americans, a HOPE scholarship for the first 2 years of college to make the typical community college education available to every American. I believe every working family ought also to be able to deduct up to $10,000 in college tuition costs per year for education after that. I believe the families of this country ought to be able to save money for college in a taxfree IRA, save it year-in and year-out, withdraw it for college education without penalty. We should not tax middle income Americans for the money they spend on college. We'll get the money back down the road many times over."", 'I want to say here, before I go further, that these tax cuts and every other one I mention tonight are all fully paid for in my balanced budget plan, line by line, dime by dime, and they focus on education.', 'Now, one thing so many of our fellow Americans are learning is that education no longer stops on graduation day. I have proposed a new ""GI bill"" for American workers, a $2,600 grant for unemployed and underemployed Americans so that they can get the training and the skills they need to go back to work at better paying jobs, good high-skilled jobs for a good future.', 'But we must demand excellence at every level of education. We must insist that our students learn the old basics we learned and the new basics they have to know for the next century. Tonight let us set a clear national goal: All children should be able to read on their own by the third grade. When 40 percent of our 8year-olds cannot read as well as they should, we have to do something. I want to send 30,000 reading specialists and national service corps members to mobilize a volunteer army of one million reading tutors for third graders all across America. They will teach our young children to read.', ""Let me say to our parents: You have to lead the way. Every tired night you spend reading a book to your child will be worth it many times over. I know that Hillary and I still talk about the books we read to Chelsea when we were so tired we could hardly stay awake. We still remember them, and more important, so does she. But we're going to help the parents of this country make every child able to read for himself or herself by the age of 8, by the third grade. Do you believe we can do that? Will you help us do that? [Applause] Thank you."", 'We must give parents, all parents, the right to choose which public school their children will attend and to let teachers form new charter schools with a charter they can keep only if they do a good job. We must keep our schools open late so that young people have someplace to go and something to say yes to and stay off the street.', ""We must require that our students pass tough tests to keep moving up in school. A diploma has to mean something when they get out. We should reward teachers that are doing a good job, remove those who don't measure up, but in every case, never forget that none of us would be here tonight if it weren't for our teachers. I know I wouldn't. We ought to lift them up, not tear them down."", 'We need schools that will take our children into the next century. We need schools that are rebuilt and modernized with an unprecedented commitment from the National Government to increase school construction and with every single library and classroom in America connected to the information superhighway by the year 2000.', 'Now, folks, if we do these things, every 8year-old will be able to read, every 12-yearold will be able to log in on the Internet, every 18-year-old will be able to go to college, and all Americans will have the knowledge they need to cross that bridge to the 21st century.', 'I want to build a bridge to the 21st century in which we create a strong and growing economy to preserve the legacy of opportunity for the next generation, by balancing our budget in a way that protects our values and ensuring that every family will be able to own and protect the value of their most important asset, their home.', 'Tonight let us proclaim to the American people, we will balance the budget. And let us also proclaim, we will do it in a way that preserves Medicare, Medicaid, education, the environment, the integrity of our pensions, the strength of our people.', ""Now, last year when the Republican Congress sent me a budget that violated those values and principles, I vetoed it. And I would do it again tomorrow. I could never allow cuts that devastate education for our children, that pollute our environment, that end the guarantee of health care for those who are served under Medicaid, that end our duty or violate our duty to our parents through Medicare. I just couldn't do that. As long as I'm President, I'll never let it happen. And it doesn't matter if they try again, as they did before, to use the blackmail threat of a shutdown of the Federal Government to force these things on the American people. We didn't let it happen before. We won't let it happen again."", 'Of course, there is a better answer to this dilemma. We could have the right kind of balanced budget with a new Congress, a Democratic Congress.', 'I want to balance the budget with real cuts in Government, in waste. I want a plan that invests in education, as mine does, in technology, and yes, in research, as Christopher Reeve so powerfully reminded us we must do.', 'And my plan gives Americans tax cuts that will help our economy to grow. I want to expand IRA\'s so that young people can save tax-free to buy a first home. Tonight I propose a new tax cut for homeownership that says to every middle income working family in this country, if you sell your home, you will not have to pay a capital gains tax on it ever, not ever. I want every American to be able to hear those beautiful words, ""Welcome home.""', ""Let me say again, every tax cut I call for tonight is targeted, it's responsible, and it is paid for within my balanced budget plan. My tax cuts will not undermine our economy, they will speed economic growth."", 'We should cut taxes for the family sending a child to college, for the worker returning to college, for the family saving to buy a home or for long-term health care, and a $500-perchild credit for middle income families raising their children who need help with child care and what the children will do after school. That is the right way to cut taxes: pro-family, proeducation, pro-economic growth.', 'Now, our opponents have put forward a very different plan, a risky $550 billion tax scheme that will force them to ask for even bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment than they passed and I vetoed last year. But even then they will not cover the costs of their scheme, so that even then this plan will explode the deficit, which will increase interest rates by 2 percent, according to their own estimates last year. It will require huge cuts in the very investments we need to grow and to grow together and, at the same time, slow down the economy.', 'You know what higher interest rates mean? To you it means a higher mortgage payment, a higher car payment, a higher credit card payment. To our economy it means business people will not borrow as much money, invest as much money, create as many new jobs, create as much wealth, raise as many wages. Do we really want to make that same mistake all over again?', 'Audience members. No-o-o!', 'The President. Do we really want to stop economic growth again?', 'Audience members. No-o-o!', 'The President. Do we really want to start piling up another mountain of debt?', 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. Do we want to bring back the recession of 1991 and '92?"", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', 'The President. Do we want to weaken our bridge to the 21st century?', 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. Of course we don't. We have an obligation, you and I, to leave our children a legacy of opportunity, not a legacy of debt. Our budget would be balanced today, we would have a surplus today, if we didn't have to make the interest payments on the debt run up in the 12 years before the Clinton/Gore administration took office."", 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. So let me say, this is one of those areas in which I respectfully disagree with my opponent. I don't believe we should bet the farm, and I certainly don't believe we should bet the country. We should stay on the right track to the 21st century."", 'Opportunity alone is not enough. I want to build an America in the 21st century in which all Americans take personal responsibility for themselves, their families, their communities, and their country. I want our Nation to take responsibility to make sure that every single child can look out the window in the morning and see a whole community getting up and going to work.', ""We want these young people to know the thrill of the first paycheck, the challenge of starting that first business, the pride in following in a parent's footsteps. The welfare reform law I signed last week gives America a chance, but not a guarantee, to have that kind of new beginning, to have a new social bargain with the poor, guaranteeing health care, child care, and nutrition for the children but requiring ablebodied parents to work for the income."", 'Now, I say to all of you, whether you supported the law or opposed it, but especially to those who supported it, we have a responsibility, we have a moral obligation to make sure the people who are being required to work have the opportunity to work. We must make sure the jobs are there. There should be one million new jobs for welfare recipients by the year 2000. States under this law can now take the money that was spent on the welfare check and use it to help businesses provide paychecks. I challenge every State to do it soon.', ""I propose also to give businesses a tax credit for every person hired off welfare and kept employed. I propose to offer private job placement firms a bonus for every welfare recipient they place in a job who stays in it. And more important, I want to help communities put welfare recipients to work right now, without delay, repairing schools, making their neighborhoods clean and safe, making them shine again. There's lots of work to be done out there. Our cities can find ways to put people to work and bring dignity and strength back to these families."", ""My fellow Americans, I have spent an enormous amount of time with our dear friend, the late Ron Brown, and with Secretary Kantor and others, opening markets for America around the world. And I'm proud of every one we opened. But let us never forget, the greatest untapped market for American enterprise is right here in America, in the inner cities, in the rural areas, who have not felt this recovery. With investment and business and jobs, they can become our partners in the future. And it's a great opportunity we ought not to pass up."", 'I propose more empowerment zones like the one we have right here in Chicago to draw business into poor neighborhoods. I propose more community development banks, like the South Shore Bank right here in Chicago, to help people in those neighborhoods start their own small businesses. More jobs, more incomes, new markets for America right here at home making welfare reform a reality. [Applause]', 'Now, folks, you cheered—and I thank you— but the Government can only do so much. The private sector has to provide most of these jobs. So I want to say again, tonight I challenge every business person in America who has ever complained about the failure of the welfare system to try to hire somebody off welfare and try hard. [Applause] Thank you. After all, the welfare system you used to complain about is not here anymore. There is no more ""who\'s to blame"" on welfare. Now the only question is what to do. And we all have a responsibility, especially those who have criticized what was passed and who have asked for a change and who have the ability to give poor people a chance to grow and support their families. I want to build a bridge to the 21st century that ends the permanent under class, that lifts up the poor and ends their isolation, their exile. And they\'re not forgotten anymore. [Applause] Thank you.', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. I want to build a bridge to the 21st century where our children are not killing other children anymore, where children's lives are not shattered by violence at home or in the schoolyard, where a generation of young people are not left to raise themselves on the streets."", ""With more police and punishment and prevention, the crime rate has dropped for 4 years in a row now. But we cannot rest, because we know it's still too high. We cannot rest until crime is a shocking exception to our daily lives, not news as usual. Will you stay with me until we reach that good day? [Applause]"", ""My fellow Americans, we all owe a great debt to Sarah and Jim Brady, and I'm glad they took their wrong turn and wound up in Chicago. I was glad to see that. It is to them we owe the good news that 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers couldn't get handguns because of the Brady bill. But not a single hunter in Arkansas or New Hampshire or Illinois or anyplace else missed a hunting season."", 'But now I say we should extend the Brady bill, because anyone who has committed an act of domestic violence against a spouse or a child should not buy a gun. And we must ban those cop-killer bullets. They are designed for one reason only, to kill police officers. We asked the police to keep us safe. We owe it to them to help keep them safe while they do their job for us.', ""We should pass a victims' rights constitutional amendment because victims deserve to be heard; they need to know when an assailant is released. They need to know these things, and the only way to guarantee them is through a constitutional amendment."", ""We have made a great deal of progress. Even the crime rate among young people is finally coming down. So it is very, very painful to me that drug use among young people is up. Drugs nearly killed my brother when he was a young man, and I hate them. He fought back. He's here tonight with his wife, his little boy is here, and I'm really proud of him. But I learned something—I learned something in going through that long nightmare with our family. And I can tell you, something has happened to some of our young people; they simply don't think these drugs are dangerous anymore, or they think the risk is acceptable. So beginning with our parents, and without regard to our party, we have to renew our energy to teach this generation of young people the hard, cold truth: Drugs are deadly; drugs are wrong; drugs can cost you your life."", 'General Barry McCaffrey, the four-star general who led our fight against drugs in Latin America, now leads our crusade against drugs at home: stopping more drugs at our borders, cracking down on those who sell them, and most important of all, pursuing a national antidrug strategy whose primary aim is to turn our children away from drugs. I call on Congress to give him every cent of funding we have requested for this strategy and to do it now.', ""There is more we will do. We should say to parolees: We will test you for drugs; if you go back on them, we will send you back to jail. We will say to gangs: We will break you with the same antiracketeering law we used to put mob bosses in jail. You're not going to kill our kids anymore or turn them into murderers before they're teenagers. My fellow Americans, if we're going to build that bridge to the 21st century we have to make our children free, free of the vise grip of guns and gangs and drugs, free to build lives of hope."", ""I want to build a bridge to the 21st century with a strong American community, beginning with strong families, an America where all children are cherished and protected from destructive forces, where parents can succeed at home and at work. Everywhere I've gone in America, people come up and talk to me about their struggle with the demands of work and their desire to do a better job with their children. The very first person I ever saw fight that battle was here with me 4 years ago, and tonight I miss her very, very much. My irrepressible, hard-working, always optimistic mother did the best she could for her brother and me, often against very stiff odds. I learned from her just how much love and determination can overcome. But from her and from our life, I also learned that no parent can do it alone. And no parent should have to. She had the kind of help every parent deserves, from our neighbors, our friends, our teachers, our pastors, our doctors, and so many more."", 'You know, when I started out in public life with a lot of my friends from the Arkansas delegation down here, there used to be a saying from time to time that every man who runs for public office will claim that he was born in a log cabin he built with his own hands. [Laughter] Well, my mother knew better. And she made sure I did, too. Long before she even met Hillary, my mother knew it takes a village, and she was grateful for the support she got.', ""As Tipper Gore and Hillary said on Tuesday, we have, all of us in our administration, worked hard to support families in raising their children and succeeding at work. But we must do more. We should extend the family and medical leave law to give parents some time off to take their children to regular doctor's appointments or attend those parent-teacher conferences at school. That is a key determination of their success. We should pass a flextime law that allows employees to take their overtime pay in money or in time off, depending on what's better for their family."", ""The FDA has adopted new measures to reduce advertising and sales of cigarettes to children. The Vice President spoke so movingly of it last night. But let me remind you, my fellow Americans, that is very much an issue in this election because that battle is far from over and the two candidates have different views. I pledge to America's parents that I will see this effort all the way through."", ""Working with the entertainment industry, we're giving parents the V-chip. TV shows are being rated for content so parents will be able to make a judgment about whether their small children should see them. And 3 hours of quality children's programming every week, on every network, are on the way."", 'The Kennedy-Kassebaum law says every American can keep his or her health insurance if they have to change jobs, even if someone in their family has been sick. That is a very important thing. But tonight we should spell out the next steps. The first thing we ought to do is to extend the benefits of health care to people who are unemployed. I propose in my balanced budget plan, paid for, to help unemployed families keep their health insurance for up to 6 months. A parent may be without a job, but no child should be without a doctor. And let me say again, as the First Lady did on Tuesday, we should protect mothers and newborn babies from being forced out of the hospital in less than 48 hours.', ""We respect the individual conscience of every American on the painful issue of abortion but believe as a matter of law that this decision should be left to a woman, her conscience, her doctor, and her God. But abortion should not only be safe and legal, it should be rare. That's why I helped to establish and support a national effort to reduce out-of-wedlock teen pregnancy, and that is why we must promote adoption."", 'Last week the minimum wage bill I signed contained a $5,000 credit to families who adopt children, even more if the children have disabilities. It put an end to racial discrimination in the adoption process. It was a good thing for America. My fellow Americans, already there are tens of thousands of children out there who need a good home with loving parents. I hope more of them will find it now.', ""I want to build a bridge to the 21st century with a clean and safe environment. We are making our food safer from pesticides. We're protecting our drinking water and our air from poisons. We saved Yellowstone from mining. We established the largest national park south of Alaska in the Mojave Desert in California. We are working to save the precious Florida Everglades. And when the leaders of this Congress invited the polluters into the back room to roll back 25 years of environmental protections that both parties had always supported, I said no."", 'But we must do more. Today, 10 million children live within just 4 miles of a toxic waste dump. We have cleaned up 197 of those dumps in the last 3 years, more than in the previous 12 years combined. In the next 4 years, we propose to clean up 500 more, two-thirds of all that are left and the most dangerous ones. Our children should grow up next to parks, not poison.', ""We should make it a crime even to attempt to pollute. We should freeze the serious polluter's property until they clean up the problems they create. We should make it easier for families to find out about toxic chemicals in their neighborhoods so they can do more to protect their own children. These are the things that we must do to build that bridge to the 21st century."", ""My fellow Americans, I want to build a bridge to the 21st century that makes sure we are still the nation with the world's strongest defense, that our foreign policy still advances the values of our American community in the community of nations. Our bridge to the future must include bridges to other nations, because we remain the world's indispensable nation to advance prosperity, peace, and freedom and to keep our own children safe from the dangers of terror and weapons of mass destruction."", ""We have helped to bring democracy to Haiti and peace to Bosnia. Now the peace signed on the White House lawn between the Israelis and the Palestinians must embrace more of Israel's neighbors. The deep desire for peace that Hillary and I felt when we walked the streets of Belfast and Derry must become real for all the people of Northern Ireland. And Cuba must finally join the community of democracies."", ""Nothing in our lifetime has been more heartening than when people of the former Soviet Union and Central Europe broke the grip of communism. We have aided their progress, and I am proud of it. And I will continue our strong partnership with a democratic Russia. And we will bring some of Central Europe's new democracies into NATO so that they will never question their own freedom in the future."", ""Our American exports are at record levels. In the next 4 years, we have to break down even more barriers to them, reaching out to Latin America, to Africa, to other countries in Asia, making sure that our workers and our products, the world's finest, have the benefit of free and fair trade."", ""In the last 4 years, we have frozen North Korea's nuclear weapons program. And I am proud to say that tonight there is not a single Russian nuclear missile pointed at an American child. Now we must enforce and ratify without delay measures that further reduce nuclear arsenals, banish poison gas, and ban nuclear tests once and for all."", 'We have made investments, new investments, in our most important defense asset, our magnificent men and women in uniform. By the year 2000, we also will have increased funding to modernize our weapons systems by 40 percent. These commitments will make sure that our military remains the best trained, best equipped fighting force in the entire world. We are developing a sensible national missile defense, but we must not, not now, not by the year 2000, squander $60 billion on an unproved, ineffective Star Wars program that could be obsolete tomorrow.', 'We are fighting terrorism on all fronts with a three-pronged strategy. First, we are working to rally a world coalition with zero tolerance for terrorism. Just this month, I signed a law imposing harsh sanctions on foreign companies that invest in key sectors of the Iranian and Libyan economies. As long as Iran trains, supports, and protects terrorists, as long as Libya refuses to give up the people who blew up Pan Am 103, they will pay a price from the United States.', 'Second, we must give law enforcement the tools they need to take the fight to terrorists. We need new laws to crack down on money laundering and to prosecute and punish those who commit violent acts against American citizens abroad, to add chemical markers or taggants to gunpowder used in bombs so we can crack the bombmakers, to extend the same power police now have against organized crime to save lives by tapping all the phones that terrorists use. Terrorists are as big a threat to our future, perhaps bigger, than organized crime. Why should we have two different standards for a common threat to the safety of America and our children? We need, in short, the laws that Congress refused to pass. And I ask them again, please, as an American, not a partisan matter, pass these laws now.', 'Third, we will improve airport and air travel security. I have asked the Vice President to establish a commission and report back to me on ways to do this. But now we will install the most sophisticated bomb-detection equipment in all our major airports. We will search every airplane flying to or from America from another nation, every flight, every cargo hold, every cabin, every time.', ""My fellow Democrats and my fellow Americans, I know that in most election seasons foreign policy is not a matter of great interest in the debates in the barbershops and the cafes of America, on the plant floors and at the bowling alleys. But there are times, there are times when only America can make the difference between war and peace, between freedom and repression, between life and death. We cannot save all the world's children, but we can save many of them. We cannot become the world's policeman, but where our values and our interests are at stake and where we can make a difference, we must act and we must lead. That is our job, and we are better, stronger, and safer because we are doing it."", ""My fellow Americans, let me say one last time, we can only build our bridge to the 21st century if we build it together and if we're willing to walk arm in arm across that bridge together. I have spent so much of your time that you gave me these last 4 years to be your President worrying about the problems of Bosnia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Burundi. What do these places have in common? People are killing each other and butchering children because they are different from one another. They share the same piece of land, but they are different from one another. They hate their race, their tribe, their ethnic group, their religion."", 'We have seen the terrible, terrible price that people pay when they insist on fighting and killing their neighbors over their differences. In our own country, we have seen America pay a terrible price for any form of discrimination. And we have seen us grow stronger as we have steadily let more and more of our hatreds and our fears go, as we have given more and more of our people the chance to live their dreams.', 'That is why the flame of our Statue of Liberty, like the Olympic flame carried all across America by thousands of citizen heroes, will always, always burn brighter than the fires that burn our churches, our synagogues, our mosques—always.', ""Look around this hall tonight—and to our fellow Americans watching on television, you look around this hall tonight—there is every conceivable difference here among the people who are gathered. If we want to build that bridge to the 21st century we have to be willing to say loud and clear: If you believe in the values of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, if you're willing to work hard and play by the rules, you are part of our family and we're proud to be with you. [Applause] You cheer now, because you know this is true. You know this is true. When you walk out of this hall, think about it. Live by it."", ""We still have too many Americans who give in to their fears of those who are different from them. Not so long ago, swastikas were painted on the doors of some African-American members of our Special Forces at Fort Bragg. Folks, for those of you who don't know what they do, the Special Forces are just what the name says: they are special forces.

They do not deserve to have swastikas on their doors."", ""So look around here, look around here: Old or young, healthy as a horse or a person with a disability that hasn't kept you down, man or woman, Native American, native born, immigrant, straight or gay, whatever, the test ought to be, I believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence; I believe in religious liberty; I believe in freedom of speech; I believe in working hard and playing by the rules; I'm showing up for work tomorrow; I'm building that bridge to the 21st century. That ought to be the test."", ""My fellow Americans, 68 nights from tonight the American people will face once again a critical moment of decision. We're going to choose the last President of the 20th century and the first President of the 21st century. But the real choice is not that. The real choice is whether we will build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past, about whether we believe our best days are still out there or our best days are behind us, about whether we want a country of people all working together or one where you're on your own."", ""Let us commit ourselves this night to rise up and build the bridge we know we ought to build all the way to the 21st century. Let us have faith, American faith that we are not leaving our greatness behind. We're going to carry it right on with us into that new century, a century of new challenge and unlimited promise. Let us, in short, do the work that is before us, so that when our time here is over, we will all watch the sun go down, as we all must, and say truly, we have prepared our children for the dawn."", 'My fellow Americans, after these 4 good, hard years, I still believe in a place called Hope, a place called America.', 'Thank you, God bless you, and good night.']"
44,William J. Clinton ,"August 30, 1996","[""The President. Thank you so much. Ladies and gentlemen, first of all I am thrilled to see you here in such large numbers and with such enthusiasm. It's good to be in Cape Girardeau. It's not the first time I've ever been here, but it's the first time I've ever been here as President. And the last time I was here as a private citizen, I just stopped and got a Coke and nobody came out to see me. It's pretty nice to be here with 30,000 of our best friends. Thank you. Thank you."", ""I want to say a word of thanks to some folks who haven't been recognized yet, but I used to do this, and they're the people that provided our music. They're over there in those hot uniforms: the Southeast Missouri State Band, the Cape Girardeau Central High School Band, the Jackson High School Band, the Fredericktown High School Band, the Farmington High School Band. Thank you for the music. Thank you. You were great, and we appreciate you."", ""Thank you, Governor Carnahan, for being my friend and being a great leader for Missouri, for creating jobs and advancing education and moving people from welfare to work. I want to say one thing about Mel Carnahan. While there was a lot of political rhetoric in Washington about welfare reform, Mel Carnahan developed an idea, a plan to help move people from welfare to work. We approved it. He's implementing it. And I want you to know there are, in addition to 10 million more Americans at work, there are 1.8 million Americans fewer on welfare than there were the day I became President, thanks in part to the leadership of people like Mel Carnahan."", ""Thank you, Emily Firebaugh, for presenting yourself as a candidate for Congress, for undergoing the rigors of the campaign, and for understanding what is at stake. Ladies and gentlemen, what she said is true. And what I said to the convention last night is true. Last year there was, and this year there has been, a competition of balanced budget plans. Let me remind you that they always talked about balancing the budget, but when I became President, the debt of this country had been quadrupled in 12 years. We cut it by 60 percent in 4 years. And you would have a surplus today if it weren't for the interest we have to pay on the debt run up in the 12 years before I became President."", 'And so, I said, ""Here\'s a balanced budget plan. It has a tax cut to pay for education and childrearing. It\'s targeted to middle class families. It invests in education. It invests in the environment. It invests in research and technology for the future. It protects Medicaid for the elderly in nursing homes or poor children, for families with members with disabilities. And it protects Medicare. Take it.""', 'They said, ""No. Here\'s a balanced budget plan. It cuts Medicare too much. It cuts Medicaid too much. It divides Medicare into a twoclass system. It removes the guarantee of Medicaid coverage for people in nursing homes, for families with disabilities, and for poor children. It cuts education. It cuts the environment. It lets companies raid $15 billion of their workers\' pension funds. And it raises taxes on the hardest working, lowest paid working people with children in this country. You take that, or we\'ll shut the Government down.""', ""I said no. I said no. But as I said yesterday, I have done my best to change the politics of Washington, DC, to make it more like life in Cape Girardeau. I am sick and tired of Washington taking up the headlines over who's to blame. I think the question is not who's to blame; it's what are we going to do to make America a better country and to give our children a better future?"", ""So it's not enough to blame and to say no. We have to say yes. We have to have the right kind of balanced budget. That's one of the decisions we can make if we had people like Emily Firebaugh in the United States Congress. I hope you'll send her up there and give her a chance to serve."", ""I want to also, if I might, echo something Hillary said. I know that we're pretty close to Arkansas here. And if I had doubted it, there's a bunch of my friends from northeast Arkansas in this crowd. I thank you for coming, all the people who came up from Arkansas that are over here to my left."", ""We've got some water here. And if anybody passes out in the heat, we've also got a bunch of medics here. So just wave your hand; they're all looking for you. What did she say?"", 'Audience member. [Inaudible]', ""The President. Thank you. That we have a lot of nurses here, that's what they were saying."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, I came into Chicago on a train from West Virginia to Kentucky, to Ohio, to Michigan, to Indiana, and then into Chicago. I did it to say that America is on the right track to the 21st century, but I did it to see people like you, the people we've been working and fighting for for 4 years. We left Chicago on a bus to get back on the roads that we drove in 1992 because Hillary and I and Al and Tipper, we want to see the face of America, and we want you to know that we're going to build a bridge to the 21st century that all of you can walk across with your families, with your children, and with your neighbors."", ""I want to do every single solitary thing I talked about last night, to create more opportunity, to inspire more responsibility in our people, and to build a stronger sense of community. I don't want to go over all that, but I do want to remind you of a couple of things that we are going to do to build that bridge."", ""We're going to make 2 years of college as universal in the next 4 years as a high school education is today. We're going to give America's families a tax deduction for the cost of college tuition up to $10,000 a year. We're going to enlist 30,000 mentors to mobilize an army of one million people to work with parents to help their children read so that when we get to the year 2000, there will not be 40 percent of our third graders unable to read on their own. Every third grader in America will be able to read a book on his or her own."", ""We're going to pass the right kind of tax cut, a tax cut involving a credit for $500 for children 13 and under, a tax deduction for the cost of college tuition, a $1,500 tax credit for the cost of community college, an IRA that families making family incomes up to $100,000 can take out every year and then withdraw tax-free to pay for health insurance, a first-time home, or the cost of a college education. This is the right sort of tax program for America."", ""And we're going to say to middle income families, we're going to help you get in your home. We've got the highest rate of homeownership in 15 years. We've got the highest rate of minority homeownership in the history of America. We're going to take it in the next 4 years— over two-thirds of the American people will be in their own homes. And we want to say when you sell that home and move into another one, if we have our way you will never owe any taxes on the gain you have when your home goes up again for that."", ""But folks, these tax cuts are paid for line by line, dime by dime. We've still got to balance the budget. That's why our friends and our opponents' tax plan, which is 5 times bigger and sounds sweeter, is just flat wrong because it will require us to make even bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment than the budget I vetoed. You don't want that, do you?"", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. And when they get through with that, they still won't have balanced the budget, so they'll blow a hole in the deficit. Now, that's boring compared to a check in your pocket. But let me ask it to you this way: Would you go to the bank in Cape Girardeau and borrow money to give yourself a tax cut?"", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. Well, why would you hire somebody to do it for you? Now, you think about it. What happens is, if you borrow the money to give yourself a tax cut, everybody else is borrowing money, you're going to drive interest rates up; your car payment, your credit card payment, your home mortgage payment will be higher."", ""Last year our Republican friends said it would be higher by 2 percent. That means they'll take your tax cut away, weaken the economy and, most important, it will be harder for business people here and throughout the country to borrow money, to expand their businesses, to start new businesses, to hire new people, to raise their wages. Let's have the right kind of tax cut, balance the budget, keep the interest rates down, keep the economy of Missouri and the United States of America going. That is the right thing to do."", ""We're going to prove you can protect the environment and grow the economy. There are 10 million kids living within 4 miles of a toxic waste dump. If you vote for us, we're going to clean up two-thirds of them in the next 4 years and make our kids grow up next to parks, not poison. That's the right thing to do for America's children."", ""We're going to build on our efforts to strengthen America's families and to help people succeed at work and at home. In all the crowds that I have been before over the last 4 years, when real Americans, ordinary Americans, hardworking Americans, the backbone of this country come out, I look and talk to people, and I don't ever meet a family that hasn't had some point in their lives where there's been a real challenge between the duty to raise their children well and their obligations at work."", ""That's why we passed the family and medical leave law and gave 12 million Americans a chance to take some time off for a baby's birth or a parent's sickness without losing their jobs. And that's why we want to expand the family and medical leave law, so people can take a little time off to go to those parent-teacher conferences and the regular doctor's appointment with their kids. And we think there ought to be flextime rules so that if you earn overtime, depending on what's best for your family, you get to decide whether to take the overtime in money or extra time off if your children need it. That's the kind of America we're trying to build, stronger families for a brighter future working together."", 'Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century?', 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. Will you say that in America, if you believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, if you're willing to work hard and play by the rules, we don't care what your race is, what your gender is, what your income is, where you're from, or where you started, you're all going across that bridge together with us, we're going arm in arm, together and strong?

You don\'t have an accent here, Mr. President. You don\'t have an accent here.""', ""We have had a wonderful week. I started off on a train going from West Virginia to Kentucky to Ohio to Michigan to Indiana to the Democratic Convention in Chicago to prove that we're on the right track to the 21st century, but also to see people like you who never see a President. And then we came back to our bus so we could come down here. I learned today that the last Presidents who came to Cairo were Teddy Roosevelt in 1907 and William Howard Taft in 1909. I don't know what the others were doing, but I'm glad to be back. And it's high time."", ""My fellow Americans, last night I had a chance to talk at the Democratic Convention about what we were going to do in the next 4 years to build that bridge to the 21st century. And tonight I just want to say again to you, the choice here is about more than a choice between two candidates. It is a choice between the future and the past, a choice between a philosophy that we're all in this together—we have an obligation to help each other make the most of our own lives—and a theory that you're on your own and we hope you do well. It's a choice between people who believe, as Al Gore and I do, that we have a responsibility to help you make this a strong community and help give your children the best lives."", 'I was asking here—right just when I was standing here—the Congressman said, ""Half of the police department in this town was funded by the crime bill."" I fought hard for it. They fought against it. We were right.', ""We have invested a lot of money in this area in job retraining. I think there ought to be more of it. They think there ought to be less of it. That's a clear signal. You cannot expect people to go through the changes we have had in the American economy unless we do more, and more quickly, to give people immediate access, no matter their age, to whatever education and training they need to get a new job and a better job. It is critical to our future. I'm told you have the best Job Corps retraining center in the country right here. That's the kind of thing we need to do for everybody."", ""And let me just say, you're going to have some races for the legislature here. I want to talk about how all of these races fit together. If we're going to build a bridge to the next century, we have to keep growing this economy until it reaches every Delta town and every inner-city neighborhood in the United States. It's not enough to say there are 10 million more jobs. We want to know there's a job for everybody that lives in the Mississippi Delta who wants to go to work, and a good job."", ""Last night I said to the American people— I say to you again here tonight—we changed the welfare laws, and we said we're going to have a new bargain with people who are poor and out of work and able-bodied with little children. We will guarantee health care. We will guarantee food. We will guarantee child care."", ""But now the income has to come from effort. Well, that's fine. Now, I say we have to go out and create the jobs."", ""And I outlined a plan last night in Chicago to the American people to invest several billion dollars—all of it paid for in my balanced budget plan—in poor rural areas and small towns, in our inner cities to create jobs, to give incentives to invest in those areas. The best untapped market for the United States today is those parts of the United States which haven't gotten investment, which haven't fully recovered, which need more jobs. That's what we need to do. And we have a strategy to do it."", ""I want everybody walking across that bridge to the 21st century. I don't intend to see the lower Mississippi Valley left behind. I want your children to have the best education, your parents to have the best jobs, and your people to have the best future. That is my commitment to you."", 'Let me just say a word about education.

We ought to make it possible for every family to go to a community college, at least, and have it paid for and not have to worry about it through tax cuts. We ought to give every family with a child in college or a parent in college a deduction for the cost of tuition up to $10,000 a year.

I want to thank Steve Beshear and join in what has been said about him.

It's too bad that they have to talk about—here it is, 1996—that a Congress in 1996 actually tried to break apart Medicare into a two-tier system; that a leader of the Congress, now a nominee for President, actually bragged about—in 1996, not before—actually bragged about being one of the only 12 people to vote against Medicare in the House; that they tried to take away the guarantee that Medicaid gives not just to elderly folks in nursing homes, not just to pregnant women and poor little kids but also to a lot of middle class families that happen to have a family member with a disability."", 'A lot of you saw Christopher Reeve and his magnificent speech to the convention.

Keep playing; you're great."", ""When I asked the American people last night, all of you, to help me build a bridge to the 21st century, that's not just a slogan with me. The Vice President will tell you that the thing that dominates our thinking and has for 4 years is the plain fact that our whole country is going through such a period of rapid change, how we work, how we live, how we relate to each other, how we're relating to the rest of the world. Most of these changes are very good, but not all of them are."", ""We have enormous new opportunities and some stiff new challenges.

Do we believe we have to go forward together and help each other to make the most of our own lives, or would we be better off saying you're on your own?"", ""I believe the answer is clear. We said in the convention a lot that Hillary's book was right, that it does take a village. And I believe that is right. We ought to go forward together."", ""And so tonight I say to you again, I want to build a bridge to the future with a strong economy. That means that we have to keep these interest rates down, investment going, keep the wages rising. That means we do have to balance the budget. But don't let anybody tell you any different, we do not have to balance the budget by breaking Medicare, turning away from our commitments in Medicaid, undermining our investments in our children's future, wrecking the environment, allowing $15 billion to be taken out of worker's pension funds, turning our backs on the research and development that is critical to our future here in western Kentucky. I got asked—I heard it tonight from the platform—what we want for the Technology Center in western Kentucky. We have to invest in these things, folks. So I say again, yes, balance the budget, but, no, don't compromise our future or divide our people. Do it consistent with our values. We'll grow the economy."", 'And should we have a tax cut? Yes, we should. But it ought to be the right kind. It ought to be a tax cut we can afford. It ought to be targeted to people who need it.

That is what this tax cut ought to be.', 'And I want to say again to you, any tax cut I propose to you in the election will be paid for line by line, dime by dime. I am not going to let this country go back to exploding the debt. I learned what happened. We quadrupled the debt of this country in 12 years before we took office, and today your budget would be in surplus—in surplus—and we could have a bigger tax cut but for the interest we are still paying on the debt we ran up in the 12 years before Bill Clinton and Al Gore took over the White House. That is a fact. We cannot go back.', ""Now, our opponents say the way to go to the 21st century is to have a tax cut that's 5 times that big, that's undifferentiated, that can't be paid for. Well, I want to tell you something, if they got their way there would be even bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment than the ones I vetoed that Steve talked about, number one. And still it wouldn't cover it, so we would blow up the deficit anyway."", 'Now, what does that mean? Who cares what happens to the deficit? You should. Why? Because if the Government borrows more money, then your interest rates will go up: what you paid for your home mortgage, your car payment, your credit card payment, what every small-business person in Paducah and all over western Kentucky has to pay to borrow money to start a new business or expand a business and hire new people.', ""So I am telling you, let's keep the economy going and growing and wages rising and jobs coming in with the right kind of tax cut targeted to educating our people, raising our families, meeting their health care costs, and fully paid for in a balanced budget. That's my part of the bridge to the 21st century."", ""I want you to help me build a bridge to the 21st century where we've got the best educated people in the world; where every person, no matter where they live, because of technology now has a chance, now has a chance to get a world-class education.

It has never happened before. We're going to make it happen if you help us. Will you help us do that?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Will you help us build that bridge?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. By the year 2000, I want us to make sure that 2 years of college education, at least a community college education, is just as universal in America as a high school education is today, by giving people a tax credit for the cost of that community college tuition for 2 years. We ought to do that.', ""I want us to make sure that every student in this country who wants to go to college, whether they're young, middle-aged, or older, who needs to do it can do it.

I think we ought to be lifting our teachers up and supporting them and supporting their efforts with our children and helping them to do a better job."", ""I want us to build a bridge to the future that breaks the cycle of welfare dependency. I am proud of the fact that there are 1.8 million fewer people on welfare today than on the day I took the oath of office as President of the United States. I am proud of the fact that child support collections have increased by $3 billion, 40 percent, since we took office. We're supporting more children. But I'm telling you, we can do more. If everybody paid the child support they owed, 800,000 women and children would leave welfare tomorrow."", 'It\'s all very well for us to sign a welfare reform bill, and I was glad to do it, but you cannot make people go to work unless there is a job for them to take. So in the next 4 years let us resolve that we are not only going to tell people who are poor but able-bodied on welfare, ""We\'ll support your children with health care and child care and nutrition, but you have to go to work."" Let\'s resolve to make sure we do everything we can to create the jobs wherever they\'re needed so people have the jobs to work at. That\'s a Democratic idea, and we owe it to them.', ""Let me say just one other thing. We can't build a bridge to the future unless we go there together. More than any other issues, the things that symbolize what we have to do as a community to me are, first, helping families to make the most of their own lives and to succeed at home and at work. Of the many achievements of our administration, I am perhaps most proud, among the top two or three, certainly, of the family and medical leave law because it has enabled 12 million—think about this—12 million American working folks to take a little time off when their babies were born or their parents were sick without losing their jobs. And it hasn't hurt our economy a bit. We are a stronger economy today because we're standing up for families and working people."", ""So I want to expand the family and medical leave law a little bit to say to these same working people, you can take a little time off to go to regular parent-teacher conferences, because that's important to our future, and to take your kids to the doctor or your parents to the doctor. And I want to say to people, if you earn overtime you ought to have the option— not anybody else—you ought to have the option to take that overtime in money or in extra time with your family, with your children, with your sick parents, with an uncle or an aunt with Alzheimer's, whatever you need, whatever is best for the family. We need to do what we can to make sure every single American can succeed as a parent and as a worker. That's important."", ""Last thing I want to say is, we can protect the environment and grow the economy. We still have 10 million kids living within 4 miles of toxic waste dumps. If you give Bill Clinton and Al Gore 4 more years, one of the ways we're going to build that bridge to the future is to clean up two-thirds of those dumps, the two-thirds worst of them. We want our kids to be living next to parks, not poison. And that will create jobs, not cost them. Will you help us build that bridge?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Will you help us do that?', 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. Folks, on this beautiful, soft summer night, where there are more people than I ever dreamed I'd see—and I'm sorry you had to wait so long, but a lot of your fellow Kentuckians and folks from Illinois and folks from Missouri were waiting along the side of the road, too—I just want you to think about what kind of world our children can live in."", 'The children in this audience today, many of them will be doing jobs that have not been invented yet. Some of them will be doing jobs that no one has imagined yet. Right now, not sometime in the future, right now we are involved in a project with IBM—now, listen to this—to create a supercomputer within the next couple of years that will be able to do as many calculations in one second as you could do with a hand-held calculator in 30,000 years.', ""No one knows how many opportunities are going to explode for our people. But if we want the kind of America I believe we do, we have to say, we can't make it unless we've got opportunity for everybody. We can't make it until everyone is responsible. And we can't make it unless we recognize we have an obligation to help all of our people make the most of their own lives to build strong families and strong communities so we can go forward together."", ""Now, I want you to go home and think about that tonight. Our children are going to live in the age of greatest possibility in human history if we simply have the courage to meet our challenges and protect our values. It's going to be a wonderful ride. And I just want, in this last campaign of my life, to do whatever I can to make sure that we build that bridge to the future sturdy, strong, beautiful, and straight, and wide enough for everybody to walk across. Will you help me?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. For 68 more days will you help?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. And 4 years after that will you help?', 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. I need you, and we'll do it for America. Thank you, and God bless you all.""]"
47,William J. Clinton ,"August 30, 1996","['Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, you just heard a speech from the part of our ticket who got the most sleep last night. [Laughter]', 'I asked Al last night, after the convention adjourned and I was just drained, you know— and you all were so wonderful to me, and I thank you very much—but I said, ""Gosh, I wish tomorrow we were getting up and taking the kids to the aquarium and the zoo and just kind of looking around Chicago, a wonderful town; I hadn\'t spent any time here. Why are we going out on that bus?"" [Laughter] ""Why are we doing that tomorrow?"" Totally deadpan, you know, just like he did in the speech, he said in his version of the macarena, you know, that dead stare— [laughter]—he said, ""Because we do not wish Senator Dole to win the election."" [Laughter] So I said, ""Okay, when I get up tomorrow and my back hurts and I\'m whining around, you remind me of that so I can be in a good humor."" [Laughter]', 'Rabbi, Reverend Barrow, ladies and gentlemen, I just want to echo, if I might for a moment, a lot of what has been said and make two brief points about our party and our future. First, I want to thank Don Fowler for a lifetime of devotion to our party and for doing the hard work—out of the limelight and keeps going. I want to thank B.J. Thornberry and the staff at the Democratic National Committee who have worked hard to bring our party back.', 'I thank Chris Dodd for his tirelessness and his eloquence. By the time he got through nominating me the other night I felt like a real President. [Laughter] I thought it was quite wonderful, and I thank you, sir.', 'I want to thank Marvin Rosen and Scott Pastrick and all the folks that have worked so hard in raising our funds that for a year enabled us to be on television debating the different visions of the future that we and our opponents have.', ""I feel deeply indebted to you, Debra DeLee, and to all the people who worked on the Chicago convention—a lot of people left the White House, volunteers came from all over the country. They did a wonderful job. I said before how very much I appreciate what Mayor Daley and Maggie did and the magnificent job that Bill Daley did in mustering a broad base of support for the Democratic Convention in Chicago, and I'm very grateful to them."", ""I'd also like to remind you all that we had a lot of support and help from the entire State of Illinois, and I'd like to thank the chairman of the Illinois Democratic Party, Gary LaPaille, and all the Illinois Democrats for the support they gave us. Thank you, sir. Thank you all."", 'I thank all the Members of Congress for being here. And all of you—some of you here— Joel Ferguson I see—were on the train with me. I thank you for riding the train. That was one of the great experiences of my life, and I think everybody who was on there enjoyed it.', 'Reverend Jackson, I thank you for what you said at the convention, for what you said about the First Lady, and I thank you for being there with your son. You know, I saw Congressman Jackson and his father, and I watched them together, and I thought, family values. I thought, family values. It was a beautiful thing.', 'I thank Mayor Archer for being here and for your great speech, sir, and for the example you have set in Detroit. If you can get $2 billion of private sector commitments to invest in the inner city of Detroit, we can do that everywhere in America, and we can put the people of this country back to work and give people a future.', ""I don't know if Mayor Brown from San Francisco is still here, but I thought he was here before, and I thank him for being here. He was one of our most eloquent spokespeople on television. I saw him from time to time."", 'I wanted to say two things. First of all, I want you to know how I felt, not only as a President, as a Democrat but as an American, about our convention. I had two responses to it. First of all, our friends in the other party, they had a very successful convention in San Diego, but there was a difference in theirs and ours, and I was really proud of it. We were proud of our platform, proud of our record, proud of all of our leaders, and glad to put them before the American people. But more importantly, we did not try to hide the fact that we have differences but that those differences can be constructive.', ""If you're not going to ever have a debate and a difference of opinion, what's the purpose of getting together? If we all knew the truth, there would be no point in talking. If there was nothing to learn, there would be no point in listening."", ""And the one thing I have to tell you, over the last 20 years of public life, where I've had the opportunity now to work for 20 years on the great issues that are still before us today— can you reform education so that everyone achieves excellence; can you develop the right mix in a criminal justice system so that you not only catch the people who should be caught and sent to prison but you actually find a way to reduce crime by preventing it in the first place; can you find a way to change the dynamics of the welfare system so we end the 30 years steadily growing isolation of an economic under class in America—what I have learned is that we all need a little humility here. If these things were easy, somebody would have done it already."", ""That's why I was so upset to hear our teachers condemned at the other convention. You know, they ought to try it sometime. They ought to try it sometime. Most of our children turn out fine; most of them learn a lot; most of them are doing great; a lot of them are doing great against all the odds."", ""But when we embark on this great enterprise, we should not only have confidence and energy, we should have a little humility. And that humility should make us welcome the chance together as a party and to express our honest differences, and then to explain to the American people why we're still Democrats and why we're still moving forward and what it is that we agree on, which is what our platform is all about."", ""I'd give anything if—I know political platforms are sort of out of date—I'd give anything if we could convince 20 or 30 or 40 million Americans to read that platform. It's not very long. And it says about all we need to say about why we're not a party of the past but a party of the future. And I just want you to know I'm proud of you, every one of you, and grateful to you."", ""And so I ask you to go out to the American people with that sense of confidence and hope and also honest humility. We came in here on a train. We're going to fly out of here and get on a bus. But by train or bus, we're still going to have the same message: We are on the right track to the 21st century, and we are going to build that bridge to the future, and we're going to do it together."", ""And let me just say one or two things. The Vice President went over the substantive issues, but if you think about it, we have to keep the economy strong, and then we've got to offer educational opportunity to everybody if everyone is going to have a chance to participate. That's our opportunity agenda, and it's a good one."", 'We have to keep the crime rate coming down, but we have to find a way to prevent crime in the first place. We have to try to change the welfare system with this law, but in order to do it there have to be jobs there in the first place. And let me say, I have seen with these empowerment zones that if we put a lot more of them out there, we can get more investment into our cities.', ""I can see with our brownfields initiative— that's a strange word to a lot of people—but the truth is we can't invest in a lot of our cities because there are environmental problems. If we clean them up, in many cases the investments that can be made will be less expensive in some of our high unemployment areas; in other areas, we can help in that way. We can give employers incentives to hire people on welfare. All those welfare checks can now be used to help create jobs in the private sector."", ""But the thing that I think is most important for us to say is what I said last night: Welfare for years has been a political football. Everybody had an opinion about it, even people that never talked to anybody on welfare, had never been in a welfare office, had never seen how any of these programs worked. Their sense was right—their sense was right, that somehow we had isolated a group of people in our country that we weren't bringing back in. That was true. But a lot of the specific things people said about it were dead wrong, starting with the fact that most everybody who is trapped in dependence is dying to be independent and wants to be out of it."", 'Now there is none of that left. No person can fairly argue the welfare issue one party against another. No person can fairly say, ""I\'m a politician. I\'m going to get you to vote for me by condemning poor people who just want a handout."" That\'s over. No one can do that anymore. All that stuff that people said just sort of on automatic for the last 20 years, it is over now. And if you hear anybody saying it now, you can say, ""When\'s the last time you hired somebody? What are you going to do? What is your responsibility? We have changed this. Get off the dime. Let\'s go to work. Let\'s do this.""', ""This is going to be a great opportunity for us to bring that message. I know that it was Reverend Jackson who first said to me the line I said to America last night, which is that the greatest market for our country are all the underemployed and unemployed people in America. If you brought investment back into the isolated rural areas and the inner cities of America and gave people there the chance to work and earn a good living, they would buy more American products than any country that we can presently open a market to in the next 2 or 3 years. That is the important message here. That's a very important message."", ""Now, I leave you with this thought. This is the beginning of the campaign, not the end of it. I want to get in there with everyone else who said that. I don't know how many sporting events I've watched in my lifetime—a golfer I admire blow a several-shot lead—not maybe blow it, maybe somebody else just played better that day; a basketball team 20 points ahead lose the lead in 8 minutes and lose the game. Any contest is not over until it's over. And this is a contest, and it's not over. It's just starting."", ""So I want you to share this message. And I do want you to help us register more of our voters, but I want you to help us get the people to vote who should. The thing that encouraged me about the train trip was that I felt that there's no way that many people could have come out with that level of interest, enthusiasm, and commitment unless they felt again that there was a connection between what we were doing in Washington and how they were living in the heartland. That is the connection we have to keep alive. That is the connection that drives people to the polls."", ""But it is critical that people know that we're building that bridge to the 21st century, that we're going to meet our challenges, and we're going to protect our values. Our party was founded by Thomas Jefferson. I think it's important to note that Thomas Jefferson was succeeded by Madison and Monroe, that by the time John Quincy Adams got ready to be President, he was not part of the party of his father."", ""Everybody had to be part of Jefferson's party. They just had two different factions. Then we had Andrew Jackson who was a more populist part of the party that Thomas Jefferson had founded."", ""I'm making this point for this reason: if this party represents most of the people, embodies the values of this country, and is always willing to take on the new challenges, we can be the party that we were in our beginning. We can be the party that we were for Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. We can be the party that we were for John Kennedy and President Johnson. We can be the party we started to be with President Carter, and circumstances intervened there. We can do that if we have that kind of discipline."", 'I was reading that magnificent book about the Lewis and Clark expedition and all the people in the other party who were against Thomas Jefferson buying the Louisiana Territory. And Thomas Jefferson said, ""Well, I\'m for limited Government but, my goodness, this is America, this is our future."" So he spent the equivalent of one year of the Federal budget to buy Louisiana. Can you imagine what they\'d do to me in Washington if I spent the equivalent of one year of the Federal budget on anything? A whole year of the Federal budget he spent to buy Louisiana. If he hadn\'t done it, I wouldn\'t be here today. [Laughter]', ""You think about that. I say that to say we must always keep our eye on the future. We should be proud of what we have done. We should be proud of what we have done, but we can't undo yesterday. We can be proud of our accomplishments, and we have to find a way to let our failures go because we can't undo it. And we've got to focus on the future."", ""So if you will help me in these next 68 days, we'll take this message to the people. Yes, we're on the right track, but we're not stopping the train. We're going on. We're building that bridge to the 21st century. We're building it for all Americans, and we want all Americans to join the Democrats and get the job done."", 'Thank you, and God bless you.']"
48,William J. Clinton ,"August 30, 1996","[""Thank you, thank you very much. Well, I can't believe we're all still standing. [Laughter] I'd like to join the Vice President and Hillary and Tipper in thanking the leadership of our party, Don Fowler and Chris Dodd and Marvin Rosen—who had a birthday yesterday but has really put 15 or 20 years on his life since he took this modest little part-time job as the finance chairman of our party—and all the other people from the DNC. And I thank the committee here tonight."", ""I would like to say to Carl Lewis, thank you for being here. We're honored by your presence, and we were thrilled by your last victory and every other one you had in your career."", ""And Candice Bergen, thank you so much for what you said. When you and Chloe came to visit us at the White House and Ron Brown and our other friends had just been killed in that plane crash, I don't think you know what a wonderful thing it was for me to meet a person like your daughter and remind us that life goes on and we have to think about that. So I think she helped me get through those 2 days a lot more than I helped you by being around the White House. And thank you for your gracious comments tonight."", 'I would like to just thank two other groups of people. First of all, Mr. Mayor and Maggie and Bill Daley and Dick Notebaert and the entire committee of people from Chicago did a magnificent job with this convention, and we thank them. [Applause] We thank you.', ""You know, when it's all over and it looks good, it's easy to say it was easy, but the truth is there were some considerable risks for the mayor and the city for taking on this convention after what happened here so long ago. At least we all were afraid of that. But I spent a lot of time in Chicago in the last several years; I've seen how it works, and I see how it continues to work better and better. And I believe that America should see this. And I think America has seen it. And I hope that, in addition to whatever benefit the Vice President and I and our Democratic candidates for Congress and Governor and the other races have received from this convention, I hope that Chicago got its just due. And I believe it did. And we thank you."", 'Finally, and most importantly, we should recognize the people who pulled this convention off. And I would like for Debra DeLee and every person here on the convention staff to please stand and receive a warm applause. You all were magnificent, and we thank you. Thank you, Debra, and thanks to everyone else. You were wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.', ""I have a very emotional feeling about being here tonight not only because of my wife's roots in Chicago, but on Saint Patrick's Day in 1992 we were here in Chicago when we won the primaries in Illinois and in Michigan and virtually sealed the Democratic nomination. And David Wilhelm, my campaign manager in 1992, of course, is from Chicago, and so many other people who were then on our staff or people like Kevin O'Keefe who are still there. This is a wonderful town, and I am very grateful to everyone here and throughout the State of Illinois."", ""Just to show you we're not taking this for granted, we're actually going to start this bus trip again tomorrow. After I finished the speech—and I can see I've almost lost my voice from being on the train—I figured that in the 3 1/2 days on the train we saw at least 150,000 people in the events alone. It was unbelievable."", 'So I said to Al Gore tonight, I said, ""Man, I\'m dog-tired. Why in the world are we getting on that bus tomorrow?"" [Laughter] ""Why aren\'t we taking our kids to the Shed Aquarium tomorrow? Why aren\'t we sort of just chilling out tomorrow?"" And he looked at me with that inevitable sense of humor of his and he deadpanned, ""We do not want Mr. Dole to be President of the United States."" So I said, ""Okay, but when I get up in the morning and I\'m whining about this and talking about how I\'m older than you are and I hurt everywhere, just say that again so I\'ll remember why I\'m doing this."" [Laughter]', ""We're going to do our best to make you proud. We've all worked so hard this last year and a half or so. I was looking out in this crowd tonight just really feeling bad that I couldn't go to every table and shake every hand and thank every person personally, because I just look at you and I know that we wouldn't be here if you hadn't been there for us. And many of you were there when nobody gave us a prayer of coming back, when people did not believe in what we were trying to do and did not believe that it would ever work or did not believe it would ever be apparent to the American people. And you all know who you are."", ""And I can't be at your table tonight, and I can't tonight—when I would especially like to do it—look into your eyes and thank you. But you know who you are, and tonight I want you to be very, very proud. And tomorrow I want you to be determined that tonight will not have been in vain.

[Applause]"", ""We have to build a bridge with the world's best education system for all our people, whether they live in poor inner cities, small rural communities, or the wealthiest places in America. If you help us for 4 more years, one of the things we intend to do is to make sure that every classroom in America, including right here in Mayfield, not only has the computers our students need and the teachers have the training they need but that they are hooked up to the information superhighway so our children have the same information, the same learning resources wherever they live for the first time in the history of America. Will you help us build that kind of a bridge?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. I want to make sure that we truly have education for a lifetime in America.

Will you help us build that kind of a bridge to the future? [Applause]', ""You know, in just the last couple of weeks, as the election has gotten closer, a lot of the things we Democrats have tried to do for the last 4 years have finally gotten through this Congress. We raised the minimum wage for 10 million working Americans. We made 25 million Americans, including, I might say, some families we've met alongside the road here when we started this bus trip in Missouri and Illinois and coming into Kentucky and going on to Tennessee—we've met some people alongside the road that have been helped by the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that says that you don't lose your health insurance anymore just because somebody in your family has been sick or you have to change jobs—25 million Americans."", ""Now we need to say a big part of a strong family is keeping working people's health care. In our balanced budget plan we provide assistance to help unemployed families keep their health insurance for their kids for 6 months. That's the next thing we need to do. Will you help us do that in the next 4 years? [Applause]"", ""We want to build a bridge to the 21st century with a strong economy. That means we have to keep bringing down the deficit. Now, our friends in the other party, they made a big thing of that, but now they don't think it's so important. But it is important. It's important in Mayfield. Why? Not only because you don't want to saddle your kids with debt but because if we turn away from our plan to balance the budget, it means that interest rates will go up, interest rates on your home mortgage, your car payment, your credit card payments, interest rates for the businesses you want to borrow money and hire people and give their employees a raise. So we can't afford to do that."", ""My plan will balance the budget. It will give tax cuts to families: for children under the age of 13, a $500 credit; for a $1,500 credit to go to the first 2 years of college; a $10,000 tax deduction for the cost of college tuition; an IRA you can withdraw from without penalty to buy a first home, to meet a medical emergency, or to pay for education. But it's all paid for; we can still balance the budget without cutting Medicare, Medicaid, education, the environment, without raiding the pension funds of our workers. We can do these things. That's the right way to balance the budget."", 'Now, our friends in the opposition will say, ""We\'re going to give you more money."" And that\'s true, they do offer more money in their tax cut. They offer it to people like me who don\'t need it. They offer it without being able to pay for it, and they know—I wish you hadn\'t said ""amen"" when I said I didn\'t need it. [Laughter] But it\'s true.', ""And what's going to happen? If they had their plan, what would they do? They'd cut Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment, more than they did in that budget I vetoed. That would divide us and weaken our progress. And they still wouldn't be able to pay for it, which means a higher deficit, higher interest rates, and a slower economy. Do we want to make that same old mistake all over again?"", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. We want to build a new bridge to the 21st century, and that's what we're going to do. Folks, I want us to build that bridge by working together. I want us to build that bridge by saying everybody's got a place. We worked very hard, for example, to help our bigger businesses sell their products abroad. I was proud just a few days ago at our convention when an autoworker from Toledo, Ohio, working in a plant that was opened in 1910, got up and said that he was making Jeeps and they were selling 41,000 overseas, and we were number one again, and 700 people like him had jobs. I was proud of that."", ""But we also have to have small businesses in places like Mayfield. I'm proud of the fact that we have made every small business in the country eligible for a tax cut if they invest more in their businesses, increasing their annual writeoff from $10,000 to $25,000 a year. I'm proud of the fact that in that minimum wage bill we made it possible for small businesses—made it much easier to take out retirement plans for the owners and employees and then for the employees to keep those retirement savings when they move from job to job.

I'm proud of that."", ""Let me say this: We have to build a bridge to the 21st century where people can succeed at work and at home, can be good parents, most of all. That does mean health care. It does mean retirement security. It does mean higher wages and better jobs. It also means things like the family and medical leave law, the first bill I signed as President. Twelve million American families got to take a little time off from work without losing their job when a baby was born or a parent was sick. I want to expand that to say that parents ought to go to their parentteacher conferences and their regular doctor's appointments. I want to expand that to say that when a parent earns overtime, the parent should be able to decide to take the overtime in pay or in time with their kids, depending on what they need for the family."", ""And I'm very proud of the fact that in that minimum wage law we also gave a $5,000 tax credit to families who will adopt children, and more if the children have disabilities.

I want to say to you again, briefly, what I said then. The choice in this election is whether we're going to build a bridge to the 21st century or try to build a bridge to the past, whether we think we have to go forward together as one people, helping each other to make the most of our own lives, or whether we're going to say, well, you're on your own and we hope you make it."", 'I think the choice is clear.

We need to keep on going down that track."", ""But we all know there is more to do. We all know there's more to do. The first thing we've got to do to build the right bridge to the 21st century is to make sure every single American has the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. And that means we have to increase educational opportunity and performance in the United States."", ""Thursday night I proposed a program to put 30,000 tutors together with our AmeriCorps volunteers to mobilize a million people to make sure that every single American child can read on his or her own by the time they're in the third grade. It will revolutionize their performance later on."", 'I propose that by the year 2000 every classroom and library in every school in America will not only have the computers and trained teachers to use the computers we need but will also be hooked up to the information superhighway so that kids in every classroom in Dyersburg, Tennessee, for the first time in the history of the country can get the same information in the same time in the same way that children in the wealthiest school districts in the United States do. It has never happened before.', 'I propose by the year 2000 to make at least 2 years of education after high school as universal as a high school education is today, a tax credit for the cost of community college in every State in America. We can do that and make community college education universal.', ""I propose to give a $10,000 tax credit for the cost of college tuition, and I believe that would be the best money we ever spent.

Will you stay with me in building that kind of bridge?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President.

Crop prices are up; this won't hurt them any. This is good."", ""We can have a tax cut, folks, but it needs to be targeted to the people who need it for the purposes we need it, to childrearing, to education, to buying that first-time home. I'm for an IRA that you can withdraw from without penalty to buy a home, to educate a child, to deal with a health problem. I think you ought to be able to sell your home and never pay any taxes on the gain.

It means a higher home mortgage payment because interest rates will go up. It means a higher car payment. It means higher credit card payments. And look at all these little businesses here. It means every time they want to borrow money they will have to pay 2 percent more on their money. It means fewer investments in small business and fewer jobs. We have to have a healthy small-business economy if we're going to grow America, especially in the small towns. We want to keep interest rates low, not up."", ""I want to build a bridge to the 21st century that will enable all Americans to take care of their families.

That's why we're helping small businesses to make it simpler to take out pension plans for themselves and their employees and to keep them when you move from job to job. That's why we want to change the family leave law to say you ought to be able to take a little time off from work to go to your kid's parentteacher conference or take your child to a regular doctor's appointment.

We want a campaign of ideas. We'll put our record and our ideas against their record and their ideas, and we trust you to make the decision."", ""But look where we are compared to 4 years ago. Let me just give you a few things. You just think about this: 10 million more Americans at work; 4 1/2 million Americans moving into their first home; 12 million Americans getting family and medical leave so they can take some time off when a baby is born or a parent's sick; 1.8 million Americans go from welfare to work; child support collections go up $3 billion, by 40 percent; 40 million working Americans have their pensions protected; 15 million of our hardest pressed working families get tax cuts; and every small business in the country qualifies for a tax cut if they invest more in their business to make it more productive or hire somebody else."", ""And in October, 10 million more Americans will get a pay raise when the minimum wage goes up on October 1. Twenty-five million Americans will be helped, including a lot of people in this audience, because we passed the Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform bill that says you cannot be denied health insurance or have it jerked from you just because somebody in your family has been sick or you've changed jobs. It is a good thing to do."", ""Fifty million more Americans are breathing clean air, and we've cleaned up more toxic waste dumps in 3 years than the previous administration did in 12."", ""And let's talk about some of their issues. Four years in a row, the crime rate has come down. We passed the ban on assault weapons. We passed the Brady bill. Not a single Tennessee or Arkansas hunter lost their rifle, but 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers could not get handguns to hurt people in their neighborhoods."", ""We have reduced the deficit in every one of our years of this administration. And the Clinton/Gore administration is the first administration to reduce the deficit in all 4 years since the 1840's, before the Civil War. We have the smallest Federal Government since John Kennedy was President. And there would be a surplus in the budget today if it weren't for the interest payments we're making on the 12 years of debt run up before we went to Washington to try to turn this country around. I'd say that's a pretty good record. Will you help us build on that record?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Folks, we have to do more. We do have to build a bridge to the future. The children in this audience will be doing jobs that have not been invented yet. Many of them will be working at things that have not even been imagined yet. Let me give you just one little example. Just a few weeks ago the Vice President and I announced that the United States Government was going to do a research project or a development project with IBM to build a supercomputer in the next couple of years—now listen to this—a supercomputer in the next couple of years that will do in one second what it would take you, going home with your hand-held pocket calculator, 30,000 years to do. That is an example of where we are going and how fast we are going.', ""We can create a future in the 21st century where more people have more chances to live out their dreams than ever. We can also do something with technology we've never done before, which is to give poor people and people isolated in our inner cities and our poor rural areas, who haven't had a break in 30 years in terms of economic opportunity, a chance to fully participate in the American dream for the first time in a generation, if we do it right. We can do that."", ""But we have to make the right decisions. The first thing we've got to do is to make up our mind our bridge is going to be built with the finest educational system in the world available to every single person. And let me just mention three things. Number one, we have a plan to take our AmeriCorps volunteers, 30,000 mentors, and a million more volunteers to make sure that by the year 2000 every 8-year-old in America can read on his or her own so they can learn the rest of the way through school."", ""Number two, we have a plan by the year 2000 to make sure that every classroom in America, in the poorest inner city and the most remote mountain village, every single solitary one is hooked up, not only with computers and trained teachers but hooked up to the information superhighway so that, for the first time in the history of America, the kids in the poorest districts can get immediately the same quality of information and learning that the kids in the wealthiest districts in America can get. We're going to do that by the year 2000."", ""And finally, we want to make college available to everybody who wants to go, and we want to say that by the year 2000, 2 years of college in a community college will be as universal in 4 years as a high school education is today, because we're going to pay for it by giving you a tax credit for the cost of the tuition to a community college for 2 years. And we want to give every person in college, every person in any kind of post-high school education, a tax deduction for tuition up to $10,000 a year."", 'And we want to give workers who are unemployed or underemployed access to a ""GI bill"" that will be worth over $2,000 in educational benefits to them so they can get a better job. It\'s not just young people that need an education. Anybody that loses their job in this country ought to be able to go back to school and get a better job with a better future because they\'re willing to work.', ""Now, that's a strong bridge to the 21st century. We want to build a bridge to the 21st century with a growing economy. That means that we have to continue to balance the budget."", 'I don\'t know how many times I\'ve been told, ""Mr. President, don\'t go to a good old-fashioned Democratic crowd and talk to them about balancing the budget. It bores them to death."" What\'s that got to do with Memphis? Who cares? I\'ll tell you why you should care. If we have to go start borrowing more money and you\'re trying to borrow money, what happens? Interest rates go up. What does that mean? Your car payment, your credit card payment, your home mortgage payment goes up. Even more important for your future, it means that business people have to pay more to borrow money, which means they don\'t create as many new businesses and they don\'t start as many and they don\'t hire as many.', ""One of the things that I am proudest of in the last 4 years is that in each year we have had a record number of new businesses start, including now, in America, a record number of businesses owned and operated by minorities and women. I'm proud of that. We need more of it. That's why we need to keep these interest rates down."", ""That means that our tax cut proposal is better than theirs, because ours is targeted. It's targeted to raising your children. It's targeted to education. It says you can take out an IRA and then you can withdraw from it without penalty for a medical emergency, to buy a first home, to educate your family; says you shouldn't pay any taxes on the gain from the home you sell. But we can pay for it. Every bit of it is paid for."", 'Now, they\'re saying, ""But we\'ll give you more money. Oh, yes, we\'ll give you more money."" Well, how are you going to pay for it? ""Well, we\'re going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, education and the environment even more than we did in that budget the President vetoed."" Do you want that?', 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. And then they still won't be able to pay for it so then they'll have to increase the deficit, which means higher interest rates and a weaker economy. So we get the worst of both worlds."", 'So I say, I want you to help us build a bridge to the 21st century with more economic growth, not less, and economic growth which comes here to help you. Will you do that?', 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. Now, there has been a lot of talk about responsibility and a lot of debate about welfare. Let me tell you what this new welfare law does. First of all, I'll say again, we have 1.8 million fewer people on welfare than we did when I took office. What does that mean? If you give people a job, they will take it. People don't want to be on welfare. They want to go to work. They want to go to work."", ""So here is what the new law says. It says we're going to keep giving children and their parents health care, nutrition through food stamps, the guaranteed school lunch program, and child care if they get a job. But what used to be in the check can now be sent to the State and they can use the money to create jobs."", ""Now, what I say to you is, we talked a lot about responsibility. The State of Tennessee, the State of Arkansas, and all the rest of us, we now have a responsibility to create those jobs in the inner cities and in those poor delta towns and in other places where people are on welfare because there aren't any jobs. And I have a plan to let us all be responsible by investing in these places to create new jobs where there have not been any. Will you help me build that kind of bridge to the future?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. We can't be responsible unless our streets are safe. I have fought against the efforts by my opponent and Mr. Gingrich to cut back on the safe and drug-free schools money, to cut back on the funds we give to schools to stay open later because our kids need something to say yes to, not just something to say no to. We shouldn't leave children out here on the street raising themselves. If we need to keep the schools open, we need more funds to keep them open, not less. We need to be supporting our teachers, not tearing them down. We need to be bringing them in here."", ""Well, I'll tell you something, folks, one big reason—you can ask the mayor here, you can ask any mayor in America—one big reason this crime rate has come down for 4 years is that we're putting more policemen back in the neighborhoods where they can know the folks, they can know the children, they can be partners. They can not only catch criminals, but they can stop crime from happening in the first place."", ""Now, they all voted against, the other folks did, including my opponent—they all voted against creating 100,000 policemen. Then they tried to take it away. Now they're trying to restrict it again. I say to you, why would we stop something that's working? We've got the crime rate coming down for 4 years. We need it coming down for 4 more years and it might be low enough to be tolerable. Will you help me stay with 100,000 police on the street? [Applause]"", ""The last thing I want to say is we've got to go forward as one community. And that starts with strong families. A lot of people talk about family values, but as the First Lady said in our convention, it's time we advocated things that show we value family. We've got to help people succeed, raising their children and going to work."", ""I propose to expand the family and medical leave law so that you can take a little time off without losing your job to go to a parentteacher conference or take your kid to the doctor. I propose letting people choose how to take their overtime. If they've got problems at home, if a child needs some care, if the parent has Alzheimer's, if there's some other trouble, I think people who earn overtime ought to have a choice to take it in money or time with their families, depending on what they need. Will you help me build that kind of pro-family policy as a bridge to the future? [Applause]"", ""Finally, let me say this: The Vice President and I have worked as hard as we know how to prove you can protect the environment and grow the economy. And I can't thank Al Gore enough for all the things he's taught me about how to protect the environment and grow the economy. But we passed the Safe Drinking Water Act. We passed an act to purify our food from pesticides that every farm organization in America supported. We have upgraded the meat standards of this country. We improved the clean air laws. We cleaned up all these toxic waste dumps."", ""We've still got a lot to do. You want to know one way you can grow Memphis' economy and every other city? If we cleaned up every environment problem in every city in this country, we would make those places prime targets for new investments and new jobs. We're going to clean up the environment of the cities and grow the economy."", ""We're going to clean up—there are 10 million kids in this country that live within 4 miles of a toxic waste dump. We're going to clean up the two-thirds worst ones if you'll help us so that our children can grow up next to parks, not poison. Will you help us build that bridge to the future? [Applause]"", ""Finally, let me say again, you think about the bridge that connects Memphis and West Memphis, Arkansas. You imagine that being a bridge to the future. That bridge has got to be strong enough and wide enough for all of us to walk across. That's why, when Tipper and I celebrated our birthdays, Al and Hillary and the two of us came out here to Tennessee to try to rebuild that church that had been burned. Every time somebody burns a church or defaces a synagogue or a mosque, they deface the idea of America. And as I said Thursday night, the real flame that embodies America is the flame on the Statue of Liberty, the flame that the Olympic torch—carried by citizens, heroes all across America—embodied."", ""You've got this Olympic Gold Medal winner. Why do we love the Olympics? I'll tell you why. Because everybody has got to play by the rules. You can't get a gold medal by breaking in your opponent's room the night before and breaking their legs. [Laughter] Nobody brags on you if you stand up behind a microphone and bad-mouth your opponent. You can only win if you reach down deep inside and do your best and give your all. And then if you do that, even if you don't get a medal you're better off. And we think the world ought to work that way. That's why we liked the Olympics. That's why we liked the Olympics."", ""So I tell you, my friends, you just think about that. The United States cannot afford to let racial bigotry get back into our lives. We cannot afford to let religious bigotry back into our lives. We cannot afford any kind of discrimination. We need to say to the whole world—and most important, in the privacy of our own rooms at night as we say our prayers to God, we need it to be true in our hearts—if you believe in the Declaration of Independence, if you believe in the Constitution, if you believe in the Bill of Rights, if you get up tomorrow and do your work and you obey the law and you play by the rules, you're my kind of American. I don't care what else there is about you. We're going to cross that bridge together. Will you help me build that kind of bridge to the future?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Will you help us for 68 more days?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Will you help us for 4 more years?', 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. We need you. We love you. Thank you, and God bless you. Let's go get it. Thank you.""]"
56,William J. Clinton ,"September 01, 1996","[""The President. Thank you. I'm hoarse, folks, I can't shout over you. You've got to help me tonight; I'm a little hoarse. Oh, I'm so glad to see you. Thank you for coming. Thank you."", ""I want to thank all of those who made this night possible—thank my longtime friend Joe Purvis for bringing Little Joe and the BK's here; the magnificent Philander Smith Choir, thank you very much; Mayor Dailey, Mayor Hays, Judge Villines, thank you."", ""I want to thank the young children from Gibbs Magnet School and from Clinton Elementary School for these signs. Thank you. Hold up your signs, kids. The children made all these signs. Let's give them a hand. They did a great job. [Applause] Thank you."", ""I thank Congressman Ray Thorton for being here tonight, for his service to our State. I think he's the only person in the history of Arkansas who represented two entirely different regions of our State in the Congress, president of our two largest universities, a very distinguished American citizen, and a great future judge on the Arkansas Supreme Court. Thank you, Ray, and good luck to you and Betty Jo."", ""I thank my dear friend Judy Collins for being here tonight. Wasn't she magnificent? Thirtytwo years ago this month, I went to hear Judy Collins sing at the George Washington University auditorium when I was a freshman at Georgetown. And I thought that I had never heard a voice like that, never would again. I talked about it for days. And if anybody told me then—32 years ago—we'd both be here tonight, I wouldn't have believed it. But I like it, and I'm glad to see her. I should tell you that she was 8 years old at the time of that concert. [Laughter]"", 'I want to thank my good friends Mack McLarty and Rodney Slater for being here. They are representing all the Arkansans who are serving you in Washington with great distinction, as have they.', ""Finally, let me say—I see so many other folks here—just my friends, my supporters, legislators, county officials, city officials, personal friends. I'm delighted to see all of you here. I was looking at David Pryor. He said I met him when I was 19; I did—30 years ago and a few odd months, in the hot summer Arkansas campaign of 1966 on the street of a small county seat in south Arkansas. And I thought, that guy's the best politician I've ever seen. [Laughter] He had more moves than Magic Johnson working that street, and he still does."", ""And let me say to you, David, and to Barbara, I remember when you were in the snows of New Hampshire. Many of you were also there. I remember when you stood with me when we were dropping in the polls, and people said the campaign was over. And I remember how you stood by me in the first 2 years of our Presidency under all manner of assault to stand up for what was right for America. You have done a lot of things for all of us to love you, David Pryor. But I will never forget that when it wasn't at all clear that I would be here on this night doing this in this way, you were always there because you thought it was right. And I will love you until the day I die. Thank you, and God bless you."", 'Ladies and gentlemen, 20 years ago this year when the people of our State elected me attorney general, I had my first reception in January of 1977—nearly 20 years ago—Hillary and I did right here in the Old Statehouse. And I remember what a cold and icy January it was—do you remember, Mack? All of my friends from north Arkansas just sort of slid down here on the ice and came to the reception. [Laughter]', 'Over the years I have been back here many times because I love this building. In 1979, in my first term, I asked the legislature to give us some money to restore it to its original condition so it would be ready by the time we turned 150 years old as a State, in June of 1986, and they did. This is a treasure for me because here on this wonderful lawn, under these grand trees, in front of this great building, we can live again, all of us, the history of our State, and a big part of the history of our Nation.', ""That's why I came here almost 5 years ago— 5 years ago last month—to declare my candidacy. And I used to be able to do this from memory, but you know, in spite of all David said about me being young, I'm 50 now, I've got an AARP card—[laughter]—and that means you all have to cut me some slack. So I brought a few notes here."", 'Five years ago when I was here, I said when we started this campaign for the Presidency, ""All of you in different ways have brought me here today, to step beyond a life and a job I love, to make a commitment to a larger cause, preserving the American dream, restoring the hopes of the forgotten middle class, reclaiming the future for our children.""', 'In November of 1992, when I was declared the President-elect, I was right here again in the spot that embodies for me all that is best in our State and public service.', 'So I wanted to come here just as quick as I could get here, as I begin the last campaign of my life, unless I decide to run for the school board some day. [Laughter] And I want to say to all of you, you made possible something extraordinary in these last 4 years. And I came here to give you an accounting and ask you to rear back one more time and go with me through November and into the next 4 years. Will you do that? [Applause]', ""Folks, 4 years ago we had to weather all those snide charges about a small Southern State; we had to listen to all those people trying to rain on our parade. And I had to look at all those people kind of look at me askance when I said it seemed to me that if we took the philosophy of governing that we had embraced here, not who's to blame but what are we going to do about it, it would work in Washington, too."", 'Four years ago we had high unemployment, stagnant wages, crime and welfare rolls rising, cynicism on the rise, problems unmet, middle class dreams of America in danger. Four years later, after 4 years of getting rid of ""who\'s to blame"" and asking what are we going to do about it, look where we are.', 'With a simple but profound strategy—opportunity for everybody, responsibility from everybody, and everybody that believes in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Bill of Rights is part of our American community and entitled to go with us into the future—with that simple strategy, we have over 10 million new jobs; almost 4 1/2 million new homeowners; wages are rising again for the first time in a decade; 4 years of declining crime;', '1.8 million fewer people on welfare; 10 million Americans are about to get an increase because of the rise in the minimum wage on October 1.', 'Twelve million Americans have gotten to take a little time off for the birth of a child or a sick parent without losing their job because of the Family and Medical Leave Act. Fifteen million of our hardest pressed Americans have gotten a tax cut to help raise their children. And every single small business in America has been made eligible for a substantial reduction in taxes if they invest more in their business to grow the business more and help grow our economy.', 'Forty million Americans have had their retirement savings made more secure after the terrible, damaging years of the 1980\'s. Fifty million Americans are breathing cleaner air. And, yes, Senator Pryor said it all: We fought a long, hard battle for health care and paid a big price for it. But when I signed the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, 25 million Americans were told, ""You cannot lose your health insurance because somebody in your family\'s been sick or because you have to change jobs.""', ""So I say to you, my friends here at home, what I said on that train trip and on that bus trip, which I loved because I got to see all those folks that look just like you, who are just like you, that made this country go, the kind of people the President doesn't often see if he just gets in Air Force One and then jumps in the limo and goes to the event—you get on a train, you get on a bus and you see the people that make this country go. And I'm telling you, we're better off than we were 4 years ago, and we are on the right track to the 21st century."", 'Now, I want to say—— Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Sounds good. Thank you.', 'But let me say what I said at the convention one more time. You all taught me something when I had to run for reelection as Governor all the time. [Laughter] I remember one time I was at a rally in 1984, trying to get reelected, and I gave a great speech about what a good job I\'d done. An old boy came up to me after it was over and said, ""Well, so what, Bill, that\'s what we paid you for."" [Laughter] ""What are you going to do next time?""', ""And so I say, I realize that that's what you paid me for. And that's why when I spoke to the country and to our Democratic Party in Chicago on Thursday night, I tried to lay out what I thought the stakes were in this election. My record is relevant and so is Senator Dole's, but only insofar as it gives you some guidance about what we'll do in the next 4 years, because we can't undo the past if it's bad and we can't relive it no matter how good it is. We have to think about tomorrow."", ""But I will say this, with all respect: That's what this choice is. The choice is whether we're going to build a bridge to the past or build a bridge to the future. I want you to help me build a bridge to the 21st century. Will you do that? [Applause]"", ""Now, folks, you know what kind of bridge I want to build to the future, and I don't have to tell you about the details. I want to build a bridge to the future that everybody has a chance to be a part of, and that means we have to do a lot more than we have done as a people to make sure every single person in this country, not only the children but the adults as well, have access to lifetime education and that it's the best in the world. We have to do that."", 'You think what it would mean to Arkansas and to Arkansans if we passed a tax cut that said you can have the equivalent of a community college tuition for 2 years in your pocket as a tax credit so that everybody in this country can have 2 years of education after high school, make it just as universal as a high school education is today.', ""Think what it would mean to Arkansans if we said every family in this State, except those like me who don't need it, can have a deduction for the cost of college tuition, any tuition after high school up to $10,000 a year."", 'Think what it would mean to the people of this State if we could say to every unemployed person and every underemployed person, we want you to have access to a new kind of ""GI bill,"" a ""GI bill"" for America\'s workers, because this economy changes a lot and even when we\'re creating jobs, some people are always being left behind. So we\'re going to give you $2,600 a year to spend as you see fit getting an education and finding a new job so you can get a better job with higher skills and a brighter future. Think what that would mean if we could do that here for our people.', 'Think what it would mean when we hook up every classroom and every library in every school in this State, not only with computers and trained teachers but hook them up to the information superhighway so that for the first time in the history of America in the poorest school district in Arkansas, they can get the same information in the same time with the same quality as people in the richest schools in this country do. Think what that will mean to the people of Arkansas and to our children.', ""And I want to build a bridge to the 21st century that keeps this economy going. That means we have to keep trading more. That means we have to keep investing more in technology and research. You heard Christopher Reeve talk at the Democratic Convention about that. It's not just a matter of humanity, it's a matter of our future. We are generating enormous opportunities, economic opportunities, as we search for the solution to medical mysteries."", ""We've doubled the life expectancy for people with HIV in 4 years. We now have seen for the first time in laboratory animals, animals that had their spines severed and were paralyzed, getting movement back in their lower limbs. It won't be long before we can do that for people. But we have to keep investing if we want to do that."", 'The Internet—a lot of the kids in this audience just routinely hook into the Internet. The Internet got started as a Government research project. We figured out how to do it, then we got out of the way and let the private sector take it over. But we have to keep investing.

Now, when they sent me a budget, they said, ""Here\'s our balanced budget. We\'re going to have this huge tax cut and give it to some people that don\'t need it. And you\'re going to have to take it, or we\'re going to shut the Government down. And oh, by the way, we\'re going to change Medicare into a two-class system so that the oldest, the poorest, and the sickest seniors in this country get the shaft. And oh, by the way, we\'re going to remove Medicaid\'s guarantee of health care to pregnant women and little children and the elderly in nursing homes and families with people with a disability in them. And oh, by the way, even though we\'re moving into the 21st century, we\'re going to cut back on education, everything from Head Start to college loans. And we\'re going to cut back on protecting the environment. And if you don\'t do it, we\'ll shut the Government down.""', 'I said, ""Let her rip. I\'m not going to put that on the American people."" But I did say also, ""I\'m not going to talk about who\'s to blame. You all won the Congress fair and square. You want to balance the budget, that\'s the right thing to do for America. Let\'s just balance that budget in the right way.""', 'Now, let me remind all of you here what that means. I hear people all the time—all these political consultants tell you, ""Don\'t talk to people about balancing the budget. If things are going good, they\'re bored with it."" Here\'s why you ought to care about it: because if we don\'t balance the budget and we do something that increases the deficit, what does that mean? We have to go borrow money while you\'re trying to borrow money. What does that mean? Your home mortgage, your car payment, your credit card payments go up. What else does it mean? It means businesses have to pay more to borrow money so they don\'t borrow as much; they don\'t invest as much; they don\'t create as many new jobs.', ""Arkansas has got a low unemployment now. But I want to see that unemployment rate spread to every county and every community that doesn't have a low unemployment rate yet.

Forget about that. Vote for us. We\'re going to give you a bigger tax cut."" That\'s what they say, 5 times as big.', ""Here's the problem: Number one, if you hated the budget I vetoed last time, wait until you see this one. This one will take bigger cuts out of Medicare, Medicaid, education, the environment, and worker pension funds. It's wrong."", ""And you don't want me to do that, do you?"", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. Even then, they won't pay for it. And the deficit will go up again. And that means higher interest rates and all those bad things."", 'Now, let me ask you a question, just a little old question we might ask at a country crossroads at home: Would you go to the bank and borrow money to give yourself a tax cut?', 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. Well, why would you hire somebody to do that for you? You wouldn't do that. You wouldn't do that."", ""Now, there's another alternative, but let me get down to that. I know—I learned a long time—I remember one time President Reagan came right here to this spot and gave a speech for the Republicans and tried to tell them they needed a different Governor—1984—and I'm glad you all didn't listen. [Laughter] And I know that even a President from Arkansas can't tell people from here how to vote, so I don't want you to do this for me, I want you to do it for you."", ""But you've got Winston Bryant and Vic Snyder over here trying to get into the Senate and the House, with Boyce Davis and Marion Berry.

If you want this done right, if you want me to do more than say no, if you want me to be able to say yes to the right kind of balanced budget and the kind of programs that I advocated when I spoke to the country in Chicago on Thursday night, then send Vic Snyder to the House and send Winston Bryant to the Senate, and give us a chance to grow this country in the right way. This is terribly important."", ""Let me say just something else real briefly. It's not enough to create opportunity; we also have to have more responsibility. The other guys, they talked a lot about welfare reform and hating the Government, but we reduced the Government to its smallest size in 30 years. And we reduced the welfare rolls by 1.8 million. But I signed that welfare reform bill, and I was proud to do it because—here's the new deal—there's a lot of legislators here, so you all listen to this. Here's the new deal. This deal says, for people who are poor and their children, eligible for welfare, you still get guaranteed health care, guaranteed food stamps, and guaranteed child care if you go to work. But the income check can now be given to the States, and the States can decide whether to continue the income check or whether to develop a job program that will put more people into jobs. And they have to do that."", ""Now, here's what I want to say to you folks: Now this is not a political issue anymore. Welfare is no longer an issue that conservatives can condemn liberals over, that politicians can condemn poor people over. We have gotten rid of the system people say they don't like. But if you want to require somebody with kids to feed to go to work and require them to do it, they better have some work there to go to. That is the issue now. We have a responsibility to create these jobs. And we have to build a bridge to the 21st century that puts people to work who have never had a chance to go to work before."", ""It brings me to the other person over here I want to talk about. The biggest new job States will have to perform is figuring out a humane and decent and honorable way to create work for people on welfare who are able-bodied. It is not simple. It is not easy. And every time you vote for a Governor, a lieutenant governor, a State official, a legislator, you ought to ask yourself: What kind of person am I electing, and who is most likely to be able to be most energetic in growing the economy overall and trying to figure out specifically how to do these new deals, these new jobs, especially welfare reform? I'll tell you what the answer to that is. The answer to that is Charlie Cole Chaffin, and you ought to make her the Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas."", 'I want to just say one other thing about this responsibility business. I never believed for a minute what so many Americans did, that we couldn\'t do anything about crime. And when I went around the country, started running for President, I went to town after town where the crime rate was going down. And I asked them, ""Why did the crime rate go down?"" And I talked to the police officers. They said, ""Well, we put more police on the streets. We got them out of the cars. We\'ve got them working in the neighborhoods. We\'ve got them working with the kids. And it\'s working."" And I said, ""What else do you need?"" And they said, ""Well, we could use a little help with these assault weapons, because we don\'t have them. And we could use a little other help.""', ""So here's what we did. We passed a crime bill that's putting 100,000 police on the street. The other guys voted against it. Think about this in this race for Congress. Think about this in the race for Congress and Senators. The other party led the fight against it. Then they tried to repeal the 100,000 police. Even after the crime rate had gone down for 3 years, they still tried to stop us from doing it."", ""And we're halfway home now, and we need to finish that. We've got 4 years of declining crime rates. If we had 4 more years of declining crime rates, they might be down where we could all live with it. And I want you to stay with a strategy that's working. Again, send Winston Bryant and Vic Snyder to Congress, and let's keep the 100,000 police coming."", ""Now, the last thing I want to say is, you taught me—not the other way around—that when we work together we never lose. When we treat each other with respect we always win. When we behave with dignity and honor, we're always ahead. That's still a big problem. You have no idea how much time I spend as President dealing with foreign policy problems caused because people in other countries insist on killing each other because they're different from one another. You have no idea."", ""What is Bosnia about? What is the crisis in Northern Ireland about? What is the Middle East about? What are all these tribal wars in Africa about? Just something about people, if you let them go unrestrained, that makes them think that their lives mean more when they can look down on their neighbors, and they'll even go to the point of killing them. And pretty soon they get to killing one another, and they forget why they started fighting. They just can't quit anymore."", ""Now, that's why I react so strongly when churches burn in our country and in our State. It's wrong. That's why I got so upset the other day when those African-American Special Forces personnel went home to their barracks in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and saw those swastikas on their doors. Now, folks, you read every week about some foreign policy crisis I'm dealing with. And I bet a lot of you think, you know, I wonder what Bill's thinking about that; he didn't learn much about that when he was Governor. I tell you one thing I know, if at midnight tonight I call those Special Forces and I tell them to be halfway around the world by noon tomorrow and put their lives on the line for you, they will do it. They do not deserve to have swastikas on their doors. This is not right. This is not right."", 'So I guess what I\'d like to say is we talk about this ""it takes a village"" business, but it really is important. You\'ve got to really decide, and the people of this country have to decide. Do you think we have to go forward together and that the role of the Government is to be a part of our national village to give people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives? Or do you think we\'d be better off with a sort of ""you\'re on your own"" philosophy? That\'s also a big part of this election.', 'I know that if we go forward together, if we get more opportunity for everybody and more responsibility from everybody, our best days are still ahead.', ""But I know one thing: You have got to be committed, every single one of you, to building that kind of a bridge. So think about this: All of you have been with me all of these years; this is our last go-round with the highest stakes for the largest number of people. The kind of country we'll be at the dawn of a new century and a new millennium will be determined by this election. What this country looks like when our children and our grandchildren are our age will be determined by the decisions we make in this election."", 'I have no right to ask you for anything for me; you have already given me more than I can ever repay. But for the sake of our children, our State, and our beloved country, one more time will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', ""Thank you. God bless you. Let's go get it.""]"
57,William J. Clinton ,"September 02, 1996","[""The President. Thank you. Happy Labor Day! Thank you for coming out. I must say when I left home this morning in Arkansas to fly up here, I knew that the people of De Pere and the whole Green Bay area would be in an awful good humor after the Packers did so well yesterday. But I never had any idea so many of you would come up to tell me how happy you are. I'm glad to see you. Thank you for this great crowd, for your spirit, for your love for our country, for the signs you've had here."", 'I want to thank the De Pere Band over here. Thank you for coming out to play for us on Labor Day, wearing those hot uniforms, when they could be in shorts drinking lemonade. Give them a hand. [Applause]', 'Thank you, Senator Feingold, thank you for your leadership for Wisconsin and for the United States. Thank you for your long labor for real, meaningful campaign finance reform. We will get it next time—we will. And we will get it in a bipartisan fashion that will be good for America.', ""I want to thank all those who are here— Mayor Walsh, thank you for welcoming me here. The people who are on the preprogram; the attorney general, Jim Doyle; Dr. Margaret Hutchinson; John Benson; Father Cornell—to all of you, thank you very much. Thank you, Alethia. Didn't she make a good talk, and isn't she a good representative of the young people of this country?"", ""Let me also say that Senator Feingold mentioned your former Senator Gaylord Nelson, also a great friend of mine. It was my great honor to present him with the Nation's highest citizen's award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Every person from Wisconsin should be very proud of the work Gaylord Nelson has spent since he left the Senate to save the environment for future generations."", ""My fellow Americans, this is Labor Day. We celebrate labor, and we honor labor. We honor the men and women who have built every bridge in our country's history, because you will have to help us build that bridge to the 21st century."", ""You may have noticed that in the last several days, often with my wife and daughter and sometimes with the Vice President and Mrs. Gore, I've been on a train and I've been on a bus to tell the American people we're on the right track and the right road to the 21st century, and we shouldn't change now, we should keep right on going in the right direction and build on it."", ""I wanted to take that train trip and that bus trip because I get to see more people like you. I get to hear the stories that make America live. I get to see the decisions in human terms that we have to make every day. As I said last Thursday in Chicago, fundamentally this year we face a choice between building a bridge to the future and building a bridge to the past, between whether we're going forward together as one nation arm in arm, or whether we're going to be told, you're on your own."", 'Just since I have been here today in Wisconsin, I had one person come up to me and said, ""I\'m so glad that I live in a country where we\'re all helping each other to make the most of our lives. I had a terrible accident in my family; I have someone in my family with a disability. Now I know that the only way we can maintain our lifestyle and our work is to have the kind of help that makes this the great country it is."" And we\'re working hard to build strong families and to be productive.', 'I had another young man come up to me and say, ""Five years ago I was homeless. I just finished my third year of college. I\'m so glad that you believe in college loans and you stopped them from cutting it back last year."" That\'s the kind of America I\'m proud to live in.', ""My fellow Americans, 4 years ago when the people of Wisconsin gave Bill Clinton and Al Gore a chance to lead the country, we had a simple message. We want America to go into the 21st century with the American dream alive for everyone responsible enough to work for it; with our great American community growing together, not drifting apart; with our Nation still the strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity in the world. We have a simple but profound strategy: more opportunity for all, more responsibility from all, and a place at the table for all people who deserve to be there because they believe in our values and they're willing to work for them."", ""Now, just think where we are today compared to 4 years ago: 10 million more jobs; 4 1/2 million new homeowners; 10 million homeowners who refinanced their mortgage at lower interest rates; record numbers of new businesses and exports; the lowest combined rates of unemployment, inflation, and home mortgages in 28 years. We're better off than we were 4 years ago."", ""Fifteen million of our hardest pressed working families have received a tax cut, and every single small-business person in the country has been eligible for a tax cut when they invest more money in the business to become more productive or hire more workers. Twelve million families have taken advantage of the family leave law when a baby's born or a parent's sick without losing their jobs, and our economy is stronger for it."", ""Forty million Americans had their pensions secured after the terrible days of insecurity of the 1980's, when people were losing their pensions. We changed the law, and we have cracked down on deficient pension funds because we think on Labor Day if people work their whole lives and pay into their pension funds they ought to know it's going to be there for them when that retirement period comes."", 'Fifty million Americans are breathing cleaner air, and we have cleaned up more toxic waste dumps in 3 years than the previous two administrations did in 12. This country is moving in the right direction.', ""The crime rate has come down 4 years in a row; 1.8 million fewer people are on welfare; child support collections are up 40 percent; the deficit has been cut by 60 percent. It's the first time since before the Civil War that an administration has brought the Federal deficit down in every one of its 4 years in office. That's something you can all be proud of."", ""Senator Feingold has worked hard for a balanced budget. What I want you to know when you think about all the proposals you will hear in the next 60 days about where to go from here is this: Our budget would have been balanced last year and would have a surplus this year except for the interest we have to pay on the debt run up in the 12 years before I took the oath of office. Let's don't make that mistake again. Let's keep going and finish the job. We can finish the job in 4 more years. Will you help me build that kind of bridge to the future?"", 'Audience members. Yes! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. Just a few days ago I signed legislation that is pro-work, pro-business, and pro-family. It's an example of America at its best. We raised the minimum wage for 10 million hard-working Americans, starting October 1st. We made it easier for small businesses, which create most of the jobs in this country, to take out pensions for the owners and the employees, and for those employees to keep those pensions when they move from job to job. It ought to be easier for people in small businesses to have a decent retirement as well. And we adopted a $5,000 tax credit for families who adopt children. There are a lot of children out there who need a good home today. I hope this helps more of them find it."", ""We made 25 million Americans eligible to keep their health insurance, even if somebody in the family has been sick, and even when they move from job to job, under the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill. We've been fighting for that for a long time and it's high time, and there are people in this audience today whose lives will be saved because of it because they won't lose their health insurance now if someone in their family gets sick or they have to change jobs."", 'So I say to you we are moving on the right track, but there is more to do. We have to build a bridge to the 21st century that enables every person in this country, every family, every community to make the most of their God-given potential. We have to build that bridge to the future strong and wide enough for all of us to walk across.', ""Let me tell you some of the things I hope you'll think about on this Labor Day as we honor work and family. I want to build a bridge to the 21st century in which we amend the family and medical leave law to say that you can not only take a little time off when a baby is born or in an emergency but also to take your child to those parent-teacher conferences at school and to regular doctor's appointments."", 'I want to build a bridge to the 21st century in which we have the crime rate going down for 4 more years in a row in the hope that it will finally be down where it ought to be in America. And to do that, we have to finish the work of putting 100,000 police on the street. We have to do a better job of protecting our police officers by banning those cop-killer bullets, which are not necessary to hunt in Wisconsin or Arkansas or anywhere else.', 'And I believe very strongly that the Brady bill has been a good thing for America. You know, when I signed it and I pushed it so hard and the leaders of the other party led the fight against it, they got a lot of votes in 1994. It may be why they won the Congress, banning assault weapons and the Brady bill, because they convinced a lot of rural people in Wisconsin and Michigan, my home State of Arkansas, up in New England, all over the country that somehow the Democrats were coming to get their guns.', ""Well, let me tell you something, folks, it's been 2 years now and people know the truth. Not a single, solitary hunter has lost a rifle. But 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers did not get handguns because of the Brady bill. It was the right thing to do, and we're a safer country for it. And I personally don't believe that people who commit acts of domestic violence against their spouse or their children should be able to get guns either. That is a dangerous thing. We should not do that."", ""We ought to build a bridge to the 21st century that continues to prove we can grow the economy and clean up the environment. Ten million American children still live within 4 miles of a toxic dump. If you will give us 4 more years, we will speed up the pace of toxic cleanups, even though we've done more in 3 years than the previous administrations did in 12. We'll clean up the two-thirds worst dumps in this country. We want our children to grow up next to parks, not poisons. Will you help us build that kind of bridge to the 21st century?"", ""Now that we have passed the health care protection bill, we ought to recognize that a lot of families need some help when they're between jobs. In my balanced budget plan, there is a provision to help people pay for and keep their health insurance when they and their families are between jobs. It's a good thing. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'And let me just mention two more things. This is Labor Day. We can be grateful that we have over 10 million more jobs. But we know we have to keep this recovery going. That means we have to continue to balance the budget, but to do it in a way that grows the economy and keeps us together. We can balance the budget without wrecking Medicare, turning our backs on the medical commitments of Medicaid, which includes families with disabilities, little babies that are poor, pregnant women, and the elderly in nursing homes. We can balance the budget and increase our commitment to education and to research and to the environment, not walk away from it. Will you help us balance the budget in that way? [Applause]', ""And then you have, as Senator Feingold said, the great tax debate. We can have a tax cut that will be good for the economy. I believe the tax cut we had in 1993 for the 15 million hardest pressed workers, for people who invest in new businesses to try to create them, for small businesses to invest more in their business, I think those things were good. Our tax cut plan is fully paid for, line by line, dime by dime. It supports education, health care, homebuying—and that's what it supports—and childrearing. If we can invest money to help people educate their children, care for their children, buy and sell their home, and put into an IRA and let people take out without penalty for education, for health care, for homebuying, that's good for America. Those tax cuts will be repaid to us many times over. But we have to do it while we balance the budget."", 'Now, let me say this: The other guys will say, ""We ought to have one that\'s 5 times as big. We\'ll give you more money. Vote for us. Why do you care about the deficit?"" You know, in Washington we have all these political consultants. And if you listen to them, they say, ""Don\'t ever go out to a Labor Day crowd of middle class people and talk about the deficit. Nobody cares about that."" Let me tell you why you should care about it. Let me tell you why you should care about it.', 'They say, ""We\'ll give you a tax cut 5 times as big."" You remember that budget I vetoed last year because it had excessive cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment, it allowed a raid on workers\' pension fund— $15 billion—it raised taxes on the lowest income working people. If you thought that one was bad, you wait till you see what you get with this tax plan that our opposition has proposed. And even when they get through trying to cut things even more than they did in the budget I vetoed, the deficit will still explode.', ""Why should you care? Because if the Government goes in and borrows money at the same time you're trying to, what will happen? Interest rates will go up. Our friends in the Republican Congress said last year—this is not me talking, this is them talking just last year—they say if we don't have a balanced budget plan, interest rates will be 2 percent higher. What does that mean for you? A higher home mortgage payment, a higher car payment, a higher credit card payment. Even more important, what does it mean? All the small-business people in this audience, it means higher interest rates for them. It means fewer people borrowing money to invest to create more jobs, to be more productive, to raise incomes. Folks, we tried this once before. Would you go to the bank yourself and borrow money to give yourself a tax cut?"", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. Then why would you hire someone to do it for you? Let's keep going in the right direction. Let's balance the budget, keep interest rates down, keep the economy growing and going forward. We can do it. We can do it."", 'The last and most important thing is, we have to recognize that the world of the 21st century will be the age of greatest possibility in human history, but that there is a greater challenge than ever before to make sure every person in America can participate in that. And that means we have to provide every single solitary American—and not just our children, our adults as well—with whatever educational needs they have for a lifetime. Excellent education by worldwide standards for a lifetime, not just for childhood.', ""In the last 4 years we have done a lot to invest more in education, from expanding Head Start to giving schools the power to try grassroots reforms, to staying open late after school in a lot of high-crime and other tough areas to give our young people something to say yes to instead of something to say no to. We have expanded scholarships through the Pell grant program. We have got a lower cost college loan program that a huge number of young people are taking advantage of today so they can take loans and pay them back as a percentage of their income. We're going in the right direction, but we have to do more."", 'And let me just say this: I want to build a bridge to the 21st century that has a lot of educational advances, but let me just mention three. Number one, every 8-year-old in America ought to be able to read on his or her own by the year 2000, every single one. No one should be left behind, no one.', 'I want to mobilize 30,000 mentors, our AmeriCorps volunteers who are working their way through college by doing community service, and a volunteer army of a million people to make sure that every single third grader in America can say, ""I read it myself."" That will guarantee that the rest of their academic careers and their adult lives will be filled with productive learning and enable every person to have a chance to participate in the bounty of 21st century America. Will you help me build that bridge?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Number two, I want to make sure we connect every classroom and library in every school in America to the information superhighway by the year 2000 so that for the first time in American history, for the very first time in American history, we can say with confidence, the children in the most remote rural schoolhouses, children in the poorest inner-city schools for the first time not only have computers and trained teachers, but have access to the finest learning in the same timeframe in the same way as the students in the wealthiest, most successful schools in America. We can do it. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century?', 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. And finally, I want to make sure that we make a college education available to every single solitary person in this country who is willing to work for it. I want the first 2 years of education after high school, at least a community college degree, to become as universal in 4 years as a high school diploma is today. Now, that's a tax cut worth fighting for, a tax credit for the cost of community college tuition in every State in the country. Will you help me do that?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. I want college tuition to be tax deductible up to $10,000 a year. I want to give unemployed and underemployed workers access to a skill grant worth up to $2600 a year, so that if you lose your job, you're changing jobs, and you need more education, you can get the grant, you can take it to the nearest community college or training facility so that even if you're 45 or 55 or 60, if you need more skills to support your family and improve your lot in life. Instead of being left behind in the race to the 21st century, we will take you along the way. Will you help me build that kind of bridge?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. My fellow Americans, in 4 years we can have a country where every 8year-old can read, every 12-year-old can log in on the Internet, every 18-year-old can go to college, and every American can have the knowledge that he or she needs to succeed in the 21st century. That is a bridge worth fighting for.', 'Now, as you look around at this vast sea of people here today, you don\'t know the life story of everybody who is here. There are a lot of people here who don\'t agree with each other about a lot of things. I saw one brave soul— thank you, ma\'am—has a ""Republicans for Clinton"" sign. God bless you. I wish I could sign that for you. Give her a hand. [Applause] Let me remind you that this country is not around here after 220 years because we permitted ourselves to be divided by the wrong things. It\'s because we were always united by the right things.', ""You have to continue to fight for a country that believes that, without regard to race or religion or income or status in life, if you believe in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and you're willing to show up tomorrow to do your best and play by the rules, you're part of our America. And we're going forward into the future, and you're going on that bridge with us. It's going to be wide enough for every single solitary one of us to walk across. Will you help us build that kind of bridge?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. Thank you. God bless you. Stay with us. We've got a great future. Thank you. Happy Labor Day!""]"

Can we keep the Nation on the right track with it?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. I think so, too. Happy Labor Day! Thank you for letting me be a part of it. Thank you, Senator Herb Kohl, and thank you, Senator Russ Feingold, for representing the people of Wisconsin and the people of the United States here.', 'I know that Congressman Jerry Kleczka and Congressman Tom Barrett spoke earlier. Will you keep them in the Congress? We need them there.

Will you do that?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. I want to thank Mayor Norquist for being here. I thank the majority leader—I like that sound—the majority leader of the Wisconsin Senate, Chuck Chvala, and the minority leader of the House, Wally Kunicki.

Gerry McEntee, he supported me in '92 when nobody thought I could win except my mother and Gerry McEntee. My own home was divided on whether we could win, but Gerry McEntee thought we could win. And I was watching Gerry up here talking and I thought, Gerry McEntee has got one speed, fast. Gerry McEntee has got one volume, loud. [Laughter] But he's got a big heart, and if you were in a foxhole you'd want him in there with you, fighting for the future of your family. And I'm glad he's in there with me."", ""I want to thank all of those who have performed here earlier today, the Eddie Butts Band, the Unity In Community Choir; thank those who spoke here on behalf of the issues that you are concerned about. I want to thank all the labor leaders who are here. I want to say a special word of thanks to the woman who has been badgering me to come to this event since I don't know how long, Rosemarie McDowell. Thank you, Rosemarie, I showed up. I want to thank the members of the labor movement in America for electing a leader like John Sweeney, a man with energy and vigor and direction and passion, a man who has brought our working families together and is helping us to move forward."", ""And I want to say here on this Labor Day when we work to honor our working families, I'd like to thank the labor movement for something else. You know, most members of labor unions will not be affected by the increase in the minimum wage law. Oh, some will, but the vast majority won't. But organized labor stood with me and worked for 2 years to raise the minimum wage law for the other working families in the United States who don't pay union dues and don't have those good jobs. And I thank you, John Sweeney. I thank you, Gerry McEntee. I thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That's a gift you're giving to other working families, and I thank you. Thank you for doing that. God bless you. Thank you. On October 1st, 10 million American workers, most of them women, many of them with small children at home, people who are working full time and trying to get their piece of the American dream, those 10 million folks will get a raise because of the minimum wage law. Thank you for doing it for me. On this Labor Day, they should be indebted to you."", 'Folks, when I came to Wisconsin 4 years ago and asked you to support me, I said that I wanted our country to take a new direction. I wanted to restore the American dream. I wanted to bring our people together and not let us be divided. I wanted us to go into the next century the strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity in the world. I said that we could go beyond the kind of political debate that had dominated Washington. Just like I said to the American people Thursday night, I\'m a lot more interested in what to do than who to blame. I\'m a ""what to do"" sort of person. And I think Wisconsin is a ""what to do"" sort of State.', ""I told you before, I will say again, I want this to be a campaign of ideas, not insults. I'm not interested in questioning the patriotism, the love of country of any of these folks who want to be President or Vice President of the United States or lead the Congress. What I want to do is to have a debate about our records and our ideas for the future. That's what matters, because you have to decide in this next election—you're going to elect the last President of the 20th century and the first President of the 21st century."", ""And the real issue is, how are we going to meet our challenges and protect your values? How are we going to do that? We're going to do it not by building a bridge to the past but by building a bridge to the 21st century, a bridge that all of us can walk across. We're going to do it not by telling people the Government is always your enemy and you're on your own; we're going to tell people we're all in this together and we're going forward together, all of us."", 'Folks, the nice thing about this election year and this Labor Day, unlike 4 years ago, is there is not as much guesswork in it this time. I mean, 4 years ago when I came here, Al Gore and I asked you to take a chance on us. We said, take a chance on us. And President Bush and Mr. Perot, they were telling you about how terrible my State was, a small Southern State. I heard all that stuff. They said, ""You can\'t take a chance on these guys; they haven\'t been shaving but a month or two."" [Laughter] You remember all the stuff they said.', ""Well, now you know. Four years ago, we had high unemployment, stagnant wages, rising crime, rising welfare rolls, a country that was becoming more divided, an electorate that was becoming more cynical. I've just finished a train ride and a bus ride with my wife, my daughter, my partners and friends, Al and Tipper Gore; a magnificent Democratic Convention. And I believe in the last 9 days plus, I've spoken to about 250,000 people and seen another couple of hundred thousand more. I can tell you something, folks, the rising tide of cynicism has been replaced by a rising tide of hope and belief in the future of America. We are going forward."", ""And so I say to you, why is that? Why is that? Because compared to 4 years ago, we have over 10 million new jobs. We have almost 4 1/2 million new homeowners; 10 million American families have refinanced their homes with lower mortgage rates and saved a lot of money. We've had record numbers of new small businesses. People from Wisconsin and all over America are selling more of our products around the world than at any time before, with a huge increase. We are number one again in the production and sales of automobiles for the first time since the 1970's."", ""You heard John Sweeney talking about the Family and Medical Leave Act. Could there be hope because 12 million families have been able to take a little time off for the birth of a baby or a sick parent without losing their jobs? It made the economy stronger, not weaker, to do that. Fifteen million American families, our hardest pressed working families, working for the most modest wages, with children in the home, have gotten a tax cut. Every small business in this country that invests more money in the business next year than they did this year is eligible for a tax cut. But it's one that has enabled us to bring the deficit down every single year in 4 years of this administration, down 60 percent."", ""You know, folks, I just want to say this, and you all don't have to keep this a secret when you walk around and talk to your friends. You need to know that the last time an administration reduced the deficit in all 4 years of its term was in the 1840's, before the Civil War. And you need to know that we would have balanced the budget last year and we would have a surplus this year if it weren't for the interest we're still having to pay on the debt run up in the 12 years before I became President. We don't want to do that again. Let's don't do that again. We don't want to do that again."", ""There's more hope in this country because we passed legislation to protect the pensions of 40 million Americans. I was tired of seeing these pension funds go broke, and Secretary Reich has been working as hard as he can to get contributions into the pension funds so your pensions are protected. And we're trying to give small-business people in the minimum wage bill easier access to retirement plans for themselves and their employees so they, too, will be protected, especially when they move from job to job. Every American ought to have the right to a good retirement plan, including those folks at Pabst."", ""Could it be that there is more hope in America because we're breathing cleaner air, because we've cleaned up more toxic waste dumps in 3 years than our predecessors did in 12? Could it be there is more hope here because we've upgraded the purity of our meat laws and our food laws and because finally, finally, finally just a couple of weeks ago we passed—in honor, in part, of the terrible sacrifice paid by people in this community—the Safe Drinking Water Act to make sure that we go forward to protect the public health of our people?"", ""So I say to you, things are better than they were 4 years ago. We're on the right track. We're on the right road. We're building the right bridge, the bridge to the future, the bridge to the 21st century. Will you help us build it for 64 more days? [Applause] Will you help us build it for 4 more years? [Applause] Will you walk across it with all your brothers and sisters? [Applause] Will you do it? [Applause]"", ""My friends, last night—you've already heard it said that I went to see the Packers this morning in Green Bay. I did that; I plead guilty. I hope you won't hold that against me. [Laughter] And it was funny because one of the Packers who had a pretty good game yesterday——"", 'Audience member. Brett Favre!', 'The President. No, well, he had a great game. [Laughter] But one of them happens to be from my home State, Keith Jackson. And he reminded me when I saw him this morning that his wife was at our rally in Little Rock just last night. So I want to talk to you a few moments about the future because he reminded me of this rally last night.', ""I told the folks at home—a lot of the people who came to see me there have been working for me for more than 20 years now. And I said I want this campaign to be about the future. The record that we have made is relevant because it shows you that we'll do what we say in the future and it shows you that we're on the right track. But what really matters is the future. And I told the folks at home a story I'd like to tell you."", 'In 1984—this makes the point about how elections are about the future—in 1984 I was out on a little country crossroads speaking to a rally way out in the hills in Arkansas, and I gave a barn-burning speech about what a great job I had done as Governor—I thought it was just great—and why they ought to reelect me. And this old boy came up to me in overalls and he said, ""Bill, that\'s a fine speech you gave. And you do have a good record. But,"" he said, ""that\'s what we hired you for. You drew a paycheck every 2 weeks, didn\'t you?"" [Laughter] He said, ""That\'s what we hired you for. What are you going to do if I renew your contract? That\'s what I want to know.""', ""And that's what I tried to tell the American people in Chicago last Thursday night with my fellow Democrats. I'll tell you what we're going to do: We're going to finish building our bridge to the 21st century so every American family has a chance to benefit from a growing economy, from a community that's strong and with safe streets and a clean environment, and every family has a chance to succeed at home with their children and at work, perhaps the biggest challenge American working families face today."", 'So let me talk to you a little about that. I want to build a bridge to the 21st century with the best education system in the world. I want a million children in Head Start. I want every 8-year-old in America to be able to say when they look at a book, ""I can read that all by myself."" I want every classroom, every classroom and every library in every school in America not only to have the computers they need, not only to have the trained teachers they need but to be hooked up to the worldwide information superhighway.', ""Now, if you're like me and you're sort of in the dark ages when it comes to computers, let me tell you what that means; let me tell you what that means in practical terms. You hook all these computers up, all these classrooms to the Internet, it means that for the first time in the history of the United States of America, the children in the poorest urban schools, the children in the most remote rural schools will have access to the same knowledge in the same time at the same level of quality as the children in the wealthiest schools in the United States. It has never happened before. We can make it happen now. Will you fight for that kind of future for our country? Will you help me do that? [Applause]"", ""Now, I also want to make it possible for every—every single American who wants to do it to go to college and to get a good education. And I want to talk to you about three things. Number one, I want to make 2 years of education after high school, what most of us know as a community college degree at least, I want that to be just as universal in 4 years as a high school education is today. And that's why I called for a $1,500 tax credit to the working families of America so that we can pay, through a tax cut, for the cost of tuition at any typical community college in the United States. I want America's working families to have a $10,000 tax deduction for the cost of all college tuition, any tuition your kids have after high school, for the adults or the children."", ""And I want to take all the various training programs we've had over the years and put them in a block and say to you or your friends, if you lose your job or if you're underemployed and you qualify for a Federal training program, we will give you a skills grant worth up to $2,600 a year. You take it where you want. You get the education you need. You start your life again with a better job, a higher wage, and a brighter future. That's the kind of education system I want for America. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'I want to allow working families to save more, to take out an IRA and to be able to save the money and withdraw it without penalty to pay for an education, to pay for a first-time home, to pay for a medical emergency. I want you to be able to sell your home and never owe any taxes on the gain. I want this to be a pro-family, pro-growth, pro-education tax package. You ought to have a tax credit for your children who are 13 or under that need more child care, need afterschool care.', ""But let me tell you something about this tax program. It's targeted to working families. It is paid for. It is designed to help promote childrearing, education, and work, the most important things to build strong families and successful workers. The most important thing is, this is all paid for."", 'Now, I want to say something. You can take 1,000 polls, you can talk to every political consultant in Washington and they\'ll tell you— they\'d say to me, ""President Clinton, do not go to a labor rally in Milwaukee and talk about balancing the budget. That bores people to tears. They only think about balancing the budget when the economy\'s in the tank, and then it seems like a nice thing to do. But nobody really cares about it. It\'s boring, and besides, it\'s hard. And people don\'t want to hear about hard things.""', ""Let me tell you something. I hope you care about it, because how do you think we got the economy going again? By bringing interest rates down. Why did we bring interest rates down? Because when we reduced the deficit, your Government wasn't in there borrowing all that money, and you could go borrow it. And the demand was less, so the interest rates were lower."", 'Now, our friends in the Republican Party, just last year they put out a little paper that they seem to have forgotten. It said, if we\'re not on a path to the balanced budget, interest rates will go up to 2 percent. Now they say, ""Don\'t vote to reelect President Clinton. Vote for us; we\'ll give you a bigger tax cut."" They say, ""We\'ll give you a bigger tax cut.""', ""Let me tell you about that bigger tax cut. Two things are going to happen. If they actually did it, two things would happen. Number one, if you thought the budget I vetoed was bad with its Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment cuts, with its $15 billion raid on worker pension funds, with its tax increases on the lowest paid workers in America—all of that it had in the one I vetoed—you ain't seen nothing yet. If they pass this tax plan, they'll come back with deeper cuts. Is that what you want for our future?"", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. Will that bring us in? Of course not. Number two, it still won't cover the hole they'll blow in the deficit. So we'll have worse cuts and a bigger deficit. What does that mean? That means for you, your mortgage payment, your car payment, your credit card payment will go up. It means the business community—big business, small business, business in the middle—interest rates will be higher. They won't be able to borrow that money to invest to create more jobs, to create greater productivity, to earn more money, and raise wages."", ""So I tell you something, folks. Let's say the Democrats are pro-business and pro-labor. We're for balancing the budget and investing in education, the environment, and taking care of our folks through Medicare and Medicaid. That's our position. Will you help me build that bridge into the 21st century?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. Will you help me keep this economy going and growing? Don't you want more jobs and higher income?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. Let me say one other thing. I want to say it right here in Milwaukee. There's a lot of difference between talking about the issue of welfare reform and doing something about it. There are 1.8 million fewer people on welfare today than there were the day I became President. We didn't have to cut anybody's health care to do it; we didn't have to throw anybody into the street to do it—1.8 million fewer people. Why is that? Because most people on welfare who are able-bodied are dying to get off and will take a job if they have a chance to do it, if they can get the training to do it, if they can get the child care to do it."", ""Now, here's what this welfare reform bill I signed really does, pure and simple. And on Labor Day, we need to all listen to this, and we need to make a commitment. This bill says there is still a national guarantee for the health care of the children and the parent. There is still a national guarantee for the nutritional needs of the children and the parent. There is now national funds available for the first time for adequate child care if a person takes a low wage job, has to leave the kids behind, and they don't have the money for child care."", 'But the money that used to go in an income check every month will now be sent to the States or the localities, depending on what the State does, and they will have to figure out how to devise work for people who have been on welfare who are able-bodied, who will then do work for the income check. That is a good thing, except this: If you want to say to people, ""You\'ve got to go to work,"" there needs to be a job there for them to go see every day.', ""So I say, I am sick and tired, as a person who has spent time in welfare offices, who has talked to welfare people—I started working on welfare reform in 1980 before it was a cool, hot issue because I could see that the people who were trapped on it were the ones being hurt, and their children. But it is time now. We have changed the system. And I don't ever want to hear Republicans attacking Democrats again over welfare. I don't ever want to hear politicians attacking poor people again over welfare. I want the American people—everybody who's ever pointed their finger about this—to figure out how are we going to take this new flexibility, this new power, how are we going to take the initiatives President Clinton proposed at the Democratic Convention, putting $3 billion more into our cities to create jobs, giving more incentives to people who will hire somebody off welfare, the other things that we can do, and create jobs for these people. They deserve the jobs. You cannot put people in the street; you have to put people to work. That's what we have to make welfare reform all about, in an honorable, decent way. Will you help us build that kind of bridge to the 21st century? Every one of you, will you help me do that? [Applause] Their children need it. Our country needs it. Will you help do that? [Applause]"", ""Folks, there's a lot of other things I'd like to say today. It's getting late and it's getting hot, but I want to tell you just one or two. Do you know that we still have 10 million kids in this country living within 4 miles of a toxic waste site, even though we cleaned up more sites in 3 years than were cleaned up in the 12 years before? If you give us 4 more years, we're going to clean up 500 more sites, the two-thirds worst. We want our children to grow up next to parks, not poison. Will you help us give our children that kind of future? Will you do that? [Applause] That will create jobs, raise incomes, and clean the environment. Will you help us do that? [Applause]"", ""And the last thing I want to say is this. I have never been in a crowd of working people, talking to them and listening to them for any length of time, that I didn't find every family had at least one example of a time when they'd felt a terrible, gnawing conflict between their responsibilities as parents and their responsibilities at work."", ""You know, the American people are not lazy people. The average family is spending a lot more hours at work today than they did 25 years ago. Almost all parents are in the work force now. And the great challenge for our State—our country—is to figure out how people can do a good job of raising their kids and do a good job at work. That's what the family leave law was all about."", ""That's why I want to amend the family leave law and say you not only can have time off when there's an emergency, working people ought to be able to get some time off without losing their jobs to go to those regular parentteacher conferences at school and take their kids or their parents to the doctor. Will you help me build that kind of future? Will you do that? [Applause]"", ""Now, this has been a great day, an enthusiastic day. You have made me very happy to see the spirit in your eyes. You're the kind of people that Al Gore and I have been fighting for and working for for 4 years, and I wouldn't take the world for this experience. But this is the beginning of this campaign, not the end— the beginning, not the end."", 'Are you going to help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause] Sixty-four more days? [Applause] Four more years? [Applause] Every one of you, we need you. Wisconsin, we need you.', 'Thank you, and God bless you.']"
59,William J. Clinton ,"September 05, 1996","['Thank you. Good morning. I want to say to all of you how very glad I am to be here. I want to thank the Big Red Marching Band and the Brotherhood who performed earlier; thank you very much. Mr. Bell and Erica, thank you for your remarks, thank you for your introduction. To the chair of your school board, Doris Reddick, and Dr. Lennard, your superintendent; Governor Chiles; Lieutenant Governor MacKay; Congressman Sam Gibbons; Mayor Greco; and city councilman Bob Buckhorn; most of all to the students here.', ""You know, I had originally planned to come earlier. It was hot then—[laughter]—but Hurricane Bertha had other plans, and I decided and so did our emergency people that we didn't need the President in Florida messing up the preparations for the hurricane. Thank goodness it wasn't as bad as we had feared."", ""Today a lot of you may know there is another hurricane threatening the southeast, but not Florida. Hurricane Fran is about to deliver what could be a powerful punch in the States of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, and I want all of you to be thinking about them today. Our FEMA Director, James Lee Witt, is there working with them, and we are getting ready for that hurricane, and we hope it won't be bad. But if it is, we'll do our best to be ready."", 'Let me say, I wanted to come here to this high school, where you have so much growth and so much energy, first to say congratulations to the mayor, the school system, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and everybody else who passed that issue, that referendum yesterday to improve the schools, improve the law enforcement, and save the football team.', 'I came here because I want America to see all of you tonight. I want America to see all of you tonight because you are our future and because unless we give the young people of this country the best educational system in the world, you will not have the opportunities you deserve as we move into the 21st century. And I know you believe that, too, and I want you to support me in trying to build a bridge to the 21st century, where every child in America has the best educational opportunities in the world.', ""For the last 4 years, we've worked hard to improve education, to increase the number of our young people in Head Start, to give schools more opportunities to stay open late if the kids needed to be somewhere besides the street, to give schools more flexibility to set high standards and creative ways to meet them, and to lower the costs of college loans so that no one ever need stay away from college because of the burden of repaying them. We now have 50,000 young people—I see one sign back there— 50,000 young people serving their communities, solving problems, and earning money for college through the AmeriCorps program, and I'm proud of that, and thank you for being back there."", 'But I want to be President for 4 more years because there are some other things we need to do in education. First of all, 40 percent of the young people in this country cannot read on their own by the third grade, but 100 percent should be able to be. I have a program to put 30,000 more tutors out there, use AmeriCorps volunteers, use young people on work study, get a million volunteers and make sure every 8-year-old in America can read a book on his or her own by the year 2000. Will you help me do that? [Applause]', ""Secondly, I want to make sure that every classroom and library in the entire United States of America and every school is hooked up to the information superhighway by the year 2000. Now, let me tell you what this really means. This means that for the first time in this history of America, every child, without regard to their ethnic background, without regard to their income, kids in the poorest city neighborhoods, in the remote mountain villages in America, for the first time in the history of the country, when we hook up every classroom to the Internet with adequate computers and properly trained teachers, for the first time, all of our children will have access to the same learning, the same information in the same time. I think all American children deserve that. Don't you? Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", ""The third thing that I want to say is, I want to help everybody do what you're trying to do, which is to modernize, rehabilitate, rebuild, and build new school buildings. We cannot expect young people to learn if they do not have adequate facilities. And for the first time in the history of this country, I have proposed a program where the United States Government will help communities who are willing to make an extra effort themselves to do more to provide facilities for their young people that are decent and clean and healthy and wholesome and conducive to good learning. And I think we want every young person in this country to be in that kind of school. Don't you? [Applause]"", 'Finally, let me say that I want to build a bridge to the 21st century in which every single young person in America who wants to do it can go to college. I want to make a community college education, 2 years of education after high school, just as universal in 4 years as a high school diploma is today. And I propose to give every family a tax credit, dollar for dollar, for the cost of college tuition in the typical community college in America so that everybody will go to a community college. Will you help me get that done? [Applause]', 'And for everyone who goes on to more college, to 4 years of college or graduate school, I believe there ought to be a $10,000 tax deduction for the cost of college tuition for every year anybody is in education.', ""If we do that, in 4 years we can have a country where every 8-year-old can read, every 12-year-old can hook into the Internet, and every 18-year-old can go to college. And we'll be well on our way to doing our job for you, creating an America where there is opportunity for everybody, without regard to their gender, their race, their ethnic background, where they start from economically, an America where we're growing together, not being divided, because that's also an important function of education: to teach us to live together across our differences."", ""Half the world is being torn up by racial, ethnic, and religious differences. In America we have people from everywhere, and I'm proud of that. Look around this audience today. Aren't you proud to live in a country which is not defined by race or religion but instead by our devotion to freedom? [Applause]"", ""So that's what I came to say. A big part of building a bridge to the 21st century is building a bridge big enough to give every single boy and girl in America the chance to live up to their God-given abilities. That is an important part of building the future you deserve. I am committed to it, and I want you to be committed to it."", 'Thank you, and God bless you.']"
60,William J. Clinton ,"September 05, 1996","[""Thank you very much. Thank you so much. I tell you, I just hope you're having as good a time as I am this afternoon. Thank you. Thank you for making me feel so welcome. Thank you, Congressman Deutsch, for your remarks today and for being a steadfast ally for the people of Florida and for our administration the last 2 years. Thank you, Governor Lawton Chiles, for your lifetime of service to the people of Florida and the people of the United States and for your brilliant service as Governor."", ""I'm delighted to be here with your attorney general, Bob Butterworth; your State insurance commissioner, Bill Nelson; State Senator Ken Jenne; State Senator Peter Weinstein; Mayor Effman of Sunrise; Mayor Graham of West Palm Beach; Gloria Jackson, the chair of the Broward County Democratic Party; Sheriff Ron Cochran. And I'd like to say a special word of thanks to my friend Gerry McEntee, back here, the president of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees and a great supporter of Medicare. And I'd like to thank the Boyles who own the theater here for welcoming us. But most of all I'd like to thank Sallie and her mother, her daughter, and her granddaughter. Didn't she do a good job? Let's give her another hand. I thought she was great. [Applause] Thank you."", 'Today I want to talk to you about how all of us, regardless of our ages, grandchildren, children, parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, great-grandchildren—how we can move forward together to build that bridge to the 21st century I talked about in Chicago last Thursday night.', ""I especially want to talk a little more about health security because I know that one of the keys to enabling our families to succeed at home and at work is finding a way for hard-working people to have that health security, to provide the best possible care for people. And I'd like to talk a little bit about those who get their care from specific health care plans that have certain requirements and standards that may lower the costs but may also raise some questions."", ""You know, we have had a remarkable week and a half. I took that train from West Virginia to the convention in Chicago, and I stopped along the way in places that hadn't seen a passenger train in a long time, and there were thousands and tens of thousands of people all along the route. It was terribly moving."", ""And then, of course, we had a good convention. And then Hillary and I and Al and Tipper Gore set out on our bus tour, and we made another five States. And I figure we saw in our talks about a quarter of a million people, and another 200,000 just along the road and the rails. I never saw so many crowds, people coming out, believing in America again, knowing that we're on the track, knowing that we're on the right track and the right road to the 21st century. And it was very moving."", ""Thanks to the support I have received from others in the Congress and in the administration, we have worked very hard to move this country forward. And compared to 4 years ago, we have 10 million more jobs, almost 4 1/2 million more homeowners, another 10 million homeowners who refinanced their mortgages at lower mortgage rates. Wages are going up for the first time in a decade. We've had record numbers of new businesses in each of the last 4 years, and businesses are growing now, coming into existence at the fastest rate since John Kennedy was President. We have record—[applause]— we're selling more of our products around the world than ever before. The combined rates of unemployment, inflation, and home mortgages are the lowest in 28 years. I am proud of these things, and you should be too, as Americans."", ""For 4 years in a row, the crime rate has gone down. In Tampa, the crime rate fell 20 percent in 1995, just for example. I just came from there, so I asked for the numbers on Tampa, and I thought it was an amazing drop. There are 1.8 million fewer people on welfare than there were the day I took office. In Florida, there are over 135,000 fewer on welfare in the State of Florida alone. Child support collections are up 40 percent in the Nation—in Florida—thank you, Governor Chiles—they're up 48 percent in the last 4 years."", 'Just about 2 weeks ago, maybe 3 now—time has been flying the last few days—I signed a minimum wage bill which raised the minimum wage for 10 million hard-working Americans. It also made the employees and the owners of small businesses all across America—made it easier for them to take out retirement plans and to keep those retirement plans when they move from job to job.', ""Most of our new jobs are being created in small businesses. More and more businesses are coming into existence, going out of existence in this new, dynamic economy. We have to make it possible for people to save for their retirement even if they're in small businesses and even if they change jobs a lot of times. And I'm proud of the fact that we've got legislation now which will make that much, much easier and safer."", 'Another interesting provision that Governor Chiles and I were talking about with his daughter up in Tampa that was in the minimum wage bill is that we provided a $5,000 tax credit to people who will adopt children. There are tens of thousands of children out there who need a home, and I hope this will help more of them find it.', ""In late 1994—there's one other thing I want to mention here that was done that didn't achieve a lot of notice because it was a part of a big trade bill. But we passed a provision to strengthen the protection for pensions that protected the integrity of 40 million Americans' pension, people already retired and people saving for their retirement, to make sure that these funds are not raided."", 'And one of the things that I vetoed in that budget that Congressman Deutsch talked about, in addition to the cuts in Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment, was a provision which would have allowed $15 billion to be taken out of existing pension funds and put to other purposes. And I thought that was wrong. I think we ought to keep the integrity of our pensions systems in this country.', ""And let me say to a lot of you who may have grown up in an earlier time when we thought more about balancing our books except when there was an emergency, I'm very proud of the fact that our administration is the first administration since the 1840's, before the Civil War, to have the deficit go down in each of the 4 years of its term. It's been cut by 60 percent."", ""So compared to 4 years ago, we're in better shape. But as I said last week and I say again, there are many things we need to do to build a bridge to the 21st century that keeps the American dream alive for all of us, that enables people to succeed in their family lives and at work, that brings us together across all the lines that divide us, that keeps us the strongest country in the world for peace, freedom, and prosperity."", 'Earlier today when I was in Tampa, I had a chance to go to a wonderful high school and speak to over 2,000 students there about our goals for education in the next 4 years. I want to mobilize an army of reading tutors so that instead of having 40 percent of our 8-year-olds who cannot read on their own, in 4 years every single 8-year-old will be able to read a book on his or her own.', 'I want to make sure that every young child in America in school, without regard to their race, their income, where they have to live, from the poorest urban school districts to the most remote mountain school districts, will for the first time in the history of America have access to the same information in the same time, the same quality, as the children in the wealthiest districts do, by hooking all the classrooms up to the Internet, to the information superhighway, with adequate computers and trained teachers. We can do it for the first time in history.', 'And I want to make sure that we put a college education within reach of every family. In the last 4 years, we have worked hard to increase scholarship funds for needy students. We have worked hard to reform the student loan program so that now it works faster and costs less than ever before.', ""I remember Governor Chiles and the legislative leaders invited me to speak to the Florida Legislature up in Tallahassee. I had a very moving experience with a young couple there who had both graduated from medical school and who were doing their residency. And you know doctors don't make any money when they're residents, and they owed well over $100,000 on their education. And because we had changed the law which said that young people could pay back their loans as a percentage of their income and never be required to pay back more than that in any given year, these young people were able to avoid literally having half of their income go to their college loan repayment, and they wouldn't have had enough left to live on. We should never have anyone drop out of any level of education because of that burden. And I want to do more."", ""A lot of you can empathize with this: It's no longer possible for people to say they're through with education when they graduate from college. And now we know when people graduate from high school, chances are better than 50-50 they will not be able to find a job with a growing income. So what I want to do in the next 4 years, within 4 years, is to make 2 more years of education, the equivalent of at least a community college degree, just as universal as a high school diploma is today by giving a tax credit for the price of the tuition to the families of this country, so we can pay for it dollar for dollar through tax cuts, and everybody can at least get a community college education. I think that's very important."", ""I'm well aware that the largest community college in the United States is not very far from here. But nearly every American—nearly every American—is within driving distance of a community college. And more and more, the people you see at our community colleges are older students, non-traditional students. The average age at a lot of our community colleges is bumping 30 now. And they have people in their fifties there and their sixties there, people who have lost their jobs and have to go back and get new education and training."", 'So I say to you we ought to have that tax credit for the cost of a typical tuition at a community college. And I believe we should have a tax deduction worth up to $10,000 a year for any tuition cost at any post-high school education in the country to help people educate themselves. It will make our country stronger.', ""So I hope you'll help me build that bridge to the future for the younger part of the families that are here. But we also have to keep this economy going strong. You know, whenever we argue about, well, how are we going to pay for Medicare or Medicaid or Social Security or whatever part of it, always assume certain things about the strength of the American economy: what will the unemployment rate be, what will the incomes be, what will the growth be. We have to keep this economy going strong, and we can grow it even faster. But if we're going to do that, we have to keep investing in the things that make us strong, like education, research, environmental technology, and we have to keep bringing this deficit down."", 'Every time I leave Washington for the last 4 months, some expert has said, ""Now, Mr. President, don\'t go down there and talk about the deficit. People really cared about the deficit when the economy was bad, but nobody really understands it very well, and so they don\'t care about it once the economy gets better. It\'s boring to them. Don\'t talk to them about that."" Well, I don\'t believe that. I think you do care about whether your country is spending itself into debt.', 'Let me just briefly say why everyone should care about it. Because as our Republican friends said last year—they put out a paper on this, not me, but I agree with them—they said if we were not on a plan to a balanced budget, if we went back to permanent high deficit spending the way we did in the 12 years before I came here, interest rates would go up 2 percent. Why? Because the Government would be borrowing money and you would be borrowing money, and we would both be trying to borrow the same money so the price would go up.', ""Now, what that means is 2 percent on a home mortgage, on a car payment, on a credit card payment every month. It means 2 percent more for business borrowing, which undermines the ability of businesses to borrow money and invest, to be more productive, to give their workers raises and hire more people. It's harder to borrow money to start a new business."", 'This is a big deal, folks. We have got to keep this economy growing and going strong. And every tax cut I talked about is paid for, dime by dime, line by line. We don\'t want to go back to the old days where someone says, ""Hey, I\'m running for office, and I\'ll give you a big tax cut. No, I can\'t pay for it, and yes, it will increase the deficit, and oh, by the way, I\'ll have to cut Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment even more than last time."" That\'s what their proposal is, this acrossthe-board thing.', ""Don't go for that. We went down that road before. We would have a surplus in the budget today and could have a bigger tax cut or extend the life of Medicare with no sweat for another several years, a surplus today if it weren't for the interest we're paying on the debt run up in just the 12 years before I became the President. We don't want to make that mistake again. We dare not make that mistake again, and I don't think you want to make that mistake again."", ""Every time I come to Florida, someone talks to me about personal security. I'm proud of the fact that the crime rate has come down for 4 years in a row. I want it to keep coming down. And that means we have to finish the work of putting 100,000 police on the street. It means we ought to pass a law that expands the Brady bill, which now covers anybody who has been convicted of a felon or is a fugitive or stalker—cannot get a handgun. I think that should extend to anyone who has beaten up a child or a spouse at home. I don't believe people who are involved in domestic violence should do that."", ""And I believe that we should ban those terrible cop-killer bullets. They have no purpose other than to shoot police officers. If the police officers are willing to protect us, we ought to be willing to protect them. It's a simple thing, and it has nothing to do with hunting or sporting."", ""I believe that we have to build a bridge to the 21st century that works on building even stronger families. That's why I've said that the family leave law that I signed, the first bill I signed, has made it possible for 12 million American families, intergenerationally, just like these fine women up here—12 million families, where someone in the family could take some time off without losing their jobs for the birth of a baby or the illness of a parent. It's been a great thing for America, and it has not hurt the economy. And I would like to see it extended in a narrow way to say you can also take a little time off to take your child to the parent-teacher conference at school or your parent to a regular doctor's appointment as well, in case there are serious problems that can't be dealt with."", ""I want to see us stand up for the environment and prove we can grow the economy and protect the environment more in the 21st century. You know, I talked about this the other night, but I want to say it again. It's appalling to me— it's appalling to me that we still have 10 million American children living within 4 miles of toxic waste sites. Now, we've cleaned up more of those in 3 years than the previous administrations did in 12. But we're not doing enough; we have to do more. And so I propose just in the next 4 years to clean up 500 more, the two-thirds worst of those sites, so that we can say that our children are going to grow up next to parks, not poison. And I hope you'll help me with that."", ""And here in Florida, I can say I'm very proud of the fact that in the first 4 years we saved national parks from the ill-advised scheme to sell some of them off. We negotiated an end to a proposed gold mine at Yellowstone National Park, the crown jewel of America's whole natural history. We created the largest national park south of Alaska in the Mojave Desert in California. And I hope in the next 4 years we will complete the work of saving the Florida Everglades. And I hope you will help us do that. [Applause] Thank you."", ""Now, let's talk about health care. There are few issues that tie people together as closely as health care—all across the ages. The other night when the First Lady spoke at the Democratic Convention and said that we strongly supported a bill that says that you cannot kick a mother and her newborn child out of a hospital sooner than 48 hours, I believe that the grandmothers and the great-grandmothers and the great-grandfathers and the grandfathers were among those cheering the loudest in America. Of course these hospitals have to save money. Of course we want to cut unnecessary costs. Of course some people are healthy and fine, and there's no problem. But it ought to be a decision that the doctor can make based on what is best for the mother and the baby, and people should not be put on the street if they're not ready."", ""When we launched a remarkable effort to dramatically increase the rate of immunizations of children up to the age of 2 so that more of them would live and live healthy lives, I think the grandparents were among those who cared the most about it. And when I was saying, look, we don't want to balance the budget in a way that not only cuts too much out of Medicare and Medicaid but fundamentally changes the system, that was as big a problem—that creates a two-tier system of Medicare where if you happen to be older or poorer or sicker at the time the changes are made, the chances of your falling into second-class health care are overwhelming; or that changes the whole system under Medicaid so that there is no longer a guarantee for people who have middle class lifestyles to get some help for their parents in nursing homes; or people who have middle class lifestyles who have children with disabilities to get some help with those children so they can keep them at home and still keep their jobs and not go broke—I don't believe that's an agespecific area. I think that we all care about that."", ""On the other hand, I don't agree that you can't do anything to try to save money in these programs to save them. Everybody wants us to save Medicare. Everybody knows that we're all living longer and staying healthier. And that's good, isn't it? I mean, I think that's pretty good."", 'So when somebody tells me, Mr. President, we got this terrible problem with Medicare, since the inflation per person is not going up, it\'s just that people are living longer and the longer you live the more health care you use— to me, that\'s a high-class problem. I mean, I don\'t understand all this hand-wringing. That\'s a high-class problem if we got people living longer and being healthier and hanging around and doing things. I think that\'s a pretty highclass problem. I don\'t understand why everybody is going around like Chicken Little, ""Oh, the sky is falling. We have problems in Medicare because everybody is living."" I thought that was the object. [Laughter] I thought that was the point of the deal.', 'Do you know, if you live in the United States—this is very interesting—in 1985, because of Social Security and SSI, for the first time in the history of our country, people over 65 had a lower poverty rate than people under 65. And because of Medicare and Medicaid, because of the things you can buy into with them, now if you live to be 65 in the United States, we have the highest life expectancy of any country in the world among people who live to be 65 going forward.', ""Our overall life expectancy is slightly lower, unfortunately, because we have higher rates of violence that take out too many of our children, because our maternal care programs are not as good as they should be, and because we have a disproportionate number of people, compared to a lot of other countries, with very serious illnesses. But if you live to be 65, you are in the country with the highest life expectancy for seniors in the entire world. Now, we know what did that. I don't think that's a bad thing. I think that's a good thing. This is a high-class problem, this Medicare problem."", ""So I proposed, and I told everybody—all the advocates for the senior groups came in; we worked with them—we proposed larger savings, substantive savings over a 6-year period, in Medicare and Medicaid than any President ever had. The only problem was, I was trying to save the programs. I was trying to be fair. I wasn't trying to balance the budget on your back or make you pay for somebody else's tax cut or do something that would give us an excuse to walk away from our commitments under Medicare and Medicaid."", ""So I say to you, the first thing we ought to do in going forward is to remember what the Hippocratic oath says: First, do no harm. Let's not do something we don't have to do. Let's do as much as we have to do to save the programs. But let's not do something we don't have to do that would make it unfair to those who depend upon them. We can—I'll say again, just like Congressman Deutsch said—we can clearly balance the budget and dramatically extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund without the level of cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment in the budget that I vetoed last year."", ""My door is still open to the Congress, even as they meet now in September to try to reach an agreement on that. But I will not do anything that will cause us to harm people who have justifiably depended on this when this program is working and the problem we have is the very problem we've been trying to create for 30 years, ever since we created it, which is we hoped people would live longer and be healthier and be stronger. We can fix it, but we don't want to destroy it."", ""The second thing I want to say is, as we provide people more options in Medicare and more options in Medicaid and take steps that will further slow the rate of inflation and give people attractive options to be in managed care programs of various kinds, we ought to do it, again, in a way that really creates a win-win situation. And we can do that. I'm prepared to give Governor Chiles and all the other Governors in the country greater flexibility in how they administer the Medicaid program, but I don't think we should walk away from the populations, pregnant women and their poor young children, families with disabilities, and the seniors. I don't think we should do that. I think we should stay in there and serve those populations."", ""In our balanced budget program, we actually also proposed to do some things that we think will be very good for the economy. A lot of parents—a lot of families, for example, are caring for parents with Alzheimer's. It's a painful, difficult thing. It's also a great labor of love. If a family is doing that and saving the system money by doing it, I think we ought to provide some way for them to get some respite care for those who are caring for Alzheimer's people in their own home. And that's an example of something that I think would be a good thing to do that will actually save money to the larger health care system and enable families again to make it at work and to make it at home, and to keep that close-knit bond that we all value so much."", ""I think we are going to have to crack down even harder on those who rip the Medicare system off. We have—I will say this—I hear more about it in Florida than anyplace else, I guess, because more of you know about it, but you should know that we've saved more than $15 billion in 3 years. We have strengthened the requirements and our tools for dealing with it, and Governor Chiles has done a better job of dealing with it than any other Governor in the country, in my opinion. So we're doing our best."", ""Two weeks ago, I had the great privilege, as has already been said in my introduction, of signing the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, which is the most significant health care reform in a generation. The bill guarantees that working people can keep their health insurance if they change jobs, it gives self-employed business people a better tax break to buy insurance just like those who work for big firms. It means you don't lose your health insurance if you or somebody in your family gets sick. What it means is that up to 25 million Americans might be able to get or keep health insurance now when they couldn't do it before. It is a very good bill."", ""But we have to do more. You don't want to say to some people we have created a right for you, and it's like saying we've all got a right to go buy a Jaguar. So my next proposal is— and this, again, is paid for in my balanced budget—that we help workers and their families who are in between jobs to keep their health insurance for up to 6 months so they don't lose it while they're changing jobs."", ""This could help to bring peace of mind to 3 million Americans a year, including 700,000 children. It is paid for in my balanced budget, and it's long overdue. I also think we have to do more to give our people the assurance that they'll get the quality they are paying for and that they deserve. That's why I'm supporting the legislation I mentioned, dealing with not forcing new mothers and their newborns out of the hospital."", ""And that's why I believe we should extend consumer protections to the 140 million Americans who are now enrolled in managed care health plans. These plans—let me talk a little bit about—these plans, on balance, have given most people who are in them high quality care with more choices at lower costs, because they are, in various ways, managed care plans, the HMO's, the PPO's, and the others. But we have to make sure that the changes that are being made do not lead to a decline in the quality of health care."", ""Now, I can tell you, I've spent years studying this now, as a Governor and as President, and I am convinced that the right kind of managed care can really be the best of all worlds, can give more choices to consumers, can give people more chances to make decisions that are right for them, can keep the costs of health care down, and still maintain very high quality."", ""I am also convinced that if they're not the right kind of plans, some bad things can happen, especially by not giving managed-care customers all of the information they need. Too often, too many health care plans are literally gagging their doctors, their nurses, and other professionals by stopping them from telling patients about all their treatment options, because some of those options that may be best for the patients may be more expensive for the plan since the patient has already paid the flat rate."", 'So I want to say to you that I think this has to stop, and this is my announcement for the day. But there is a bipartisan bill, a bipartisan bill that\'s been introduced in the Congress, sponsored by Representative Ed Markey, a Democrat, and Representative Greg Ganske, a Republican, that will help to protect doctors, nurses, and patients. It\'s called the ""Patient Right To Know Act,"" and it says that the professionals cannot be gagged from giving you the information you\'re entitled to and cannot be punished if they give it to you, so that we\'ll have the best of all worlds, managed care plus consumer protection. And I want—will you help me pass that bill? [Applause] Thank you.', ""Again, I want to be clear: There are an awful lot of HMO's, PPO's, and other health care plans that give patients very good care at good value, even better value with more choices and less inflation in the health care premiums. But we have to make sure that we don't give up the quality of care. Doctors just must not face discrimination when they uphold their oath to give patients the best care. Patients should feel safe in the knowledge that they have been given the full story of what all their treatment options are and what are best for them. They should be told about the best treatment, whether it's the cheapest or not."", 'There is also more to do. There are millions of Americans who are affected by the changes in our health system which ought to feel comfortable about the health care they receive. I have asked our Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, and our Labor Secretary, Bob Reich, to form an advisory commission about the quality of care for health care consumers with health care providers, health plans, consumers, business people—all on a bipartisan basis, everybody having their story heard, but to evaluate the ways that health plans can best serve their customers over the long run so that we can have a health care system we can afford and one we can be proud of because it keeps life expectancy going up and it keeps the health of our people improving.', ""The Vice President I have asked to review this report because he has done such great work in other areas where we have tried to reinvent our Government and improve things. And what we're trying to do is to understand how these changes in the health care system are going to affect America's families, all generations of families, yours, mine, everyone else's. What are the financial implications? What are the health care implications? What else should we do?"", ""But I am confident that being for a consumer's right to know is the right thing to do here. And I am confident—I will say again— I am confident that we can find a way to preserve the Medicare program in a way that gives you more options, keeps it affordable, and doesn't divide it into a two-tier system where the elderly in our country who happen to be the oldest or the poorest or the sickest wind up getting the short end of the health care stick. I don't think any one of you want that, and I'm going to do my best to avoid that. We can do what we need to do."", 'All of this is a way of building a bridge to the future. I believe that we have to make it possible—let me say again—for families across the generations to succeed at home and at work, to honor the obligations to parents and children and still be successful in the workplace and as citizens. I believe we can do that. I believe we can do it if we build the right kind of bridge to the future, including the health care reforms I have discussed today. And I hope that every one of you will help me and yourselves and your children to build that bridge.', 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"

[Laughter]"", ""I know you've had a lot of distinguished speakers before me at this podium—my good friends Reverend Andrew Young and Reverend Jesse Jackson. I thank Reverend Jackson for what he said yesterday about his back-to-school program, which I heartily endorse, getting the parents to take the children to school, meet their children's teachers, receive report cards, turn the television off, and read to the kids. That's a pretty good program. I thank him for that and for his idea about going to the juvenile system and saving our young people before they get in trouble. I thank him for that, and I know you do."", ""I'd also like to say how very moved I was by Pat Brooks' singing today. It was magnificent, and I thank her for that.

I want to look at the progress we have made since then and about what we have to do together."", ""First, let me just say I'm sorry I was late today but I was getting an update on the hurricane, and I'd like to share it with you and ask for you to keep those people in your prayers. The people of the Carolinas are working to cope with the effects of Hurricane Fran. Eleven people have died. They and their families must be in our prayers."", ""Today I am declaring a major disaster in the State of North Carolina. Our Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, James Lee Witt, is on his way to the Carolinas even as we are here. We're going to do everything we can to help the people of North Carolina and South Carolina in this difficult time. But again, I say to you here in Florida, those of you who went through Hurricane Andrew know what it's like. We need to be praying for those people and supporting them. And there are, doubtless, people here from those two States. In addition to the hurricane, there has been and will be more rain, and there's a lot to do."", 'You are people of faith. And today we need that faith more than ever. The Scripture says that ""faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things unseen."" And we have seen, all of us in our own life, that if we have faith, we can make real and we can see those things that we hope for, that we were convicted about.', 'That is why you teach your children right from wrong, why you pass on the values that you believe in, in frequently tough surroundings, why we try to build a better future, building strong families, strong communities, strong lives.

In between, we had a pretty good convention in Chicago. I went on this trip to say to the American people we are on the right track to the 21st century, but I also wanted to look into the eyes, the hearts, the faces of the people for whom I have worked and fought for the last 4 years. Let me assure you, we are not taking anyone or anyone's vote for granted, and we know the only poll that counts is the one they take on November 5th. I ask you to remember that and help others remember it as well."", 'But think about the progress we have made together. Four years ago we had a skyrocketing deficit, unemployment at nearly 8 percent. New jobs were scarce; wages were stagnant. I came to this office with a simple strategy: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and a place for everyone in our American community, stronger and more united.', ""Look at the results: Almost 4 1/2 million new homeowners, the growth of homeowners who are African-American exceeding the national average; record number of new small businesses and record number of businesses owned by minorities and women; the deficit down 60 percent, going down in each of our 4 years for the first time since before the Civil War that has happened; crime down for 4 years; 1.8 million fewer people on the welfare rolls than the day I took the oath of office; a 40 percent increase in child support collections; an increase in the minimum wage for 10 million Americans coming October 1st; 12 million Americans taking some time off when their babies are born or their parents are sick without losing their jobs because of the family leave law; 15 million Americans getting a tax cut, the hardest working, hardest pressed Americans; 40 million Americans having their pensions protected because of actions that have been taken; health care reform that can help 25 million Americans because it says you can't lose your health insurance anymore just because you change jobs, and you can't be denied it just because someone in your family has been sick."", 'And we had more good news today. According to the latest economic statistics, our economy is growing steady and strong, creating another 250,000 jobs in August—just the latest evidence—strong growth, the highest consumer confidence in years. Since I became President, our country has created 10 1/2 million new jobs; unemployment has dropped to its lowest level in 7 1/2 years. The American economy, my fellow Americans, is on the right track, and we need to keep it going in that direction.', 'We have honored a commitment to provide an administration that looks like America and is committed to excellence. Forty-two African-Americans have been nominated to the Federal court bench since I became President. And our nominees as a whole have the highest ratings from the American Bar Association of any administration since the ratings began. You can have excellence and diversity. You can do that, and we are committed to it.', 'Diversity and excellence has also been a hallmark of my Cabinet and our other administration appointees. We were blessed with the service of my great friend and the best friend American business and American working people ever had in the Commerce Department, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. For the first time, three of the top staffers in the White House are African-American.', 'Now, that is a good start, but we have to do more. We have to make sure that all Americans have a chance to be a part of the prosperity and the possibility we are creating for the 21st century. Every American who is responsible should have the opportunity to succeed, to live out their dreams, to live up to the fullest of their God-given potential. And that is the great challenge we face today. I want to build a bridge to the 21st century where every single American has a chance to live up to their God-given potential.', 'Nothing is more important to that, as Dr. Lyons said, than education. In the last 4 years we have expanded Head Start, helped our schools shrink class size, supported new, smaller charter schools to help provide excellent educational opportunities, and we now know that an enormous percentage of the students in them are minority students and poor students.', ""We've expanded antidrug education and prevention programs, imposed a zero tolerance for guns, opened the doors to college wider than ever with more scholarships and a lower cost college loan program. We have created the national service program, which has provided opportunities for 50,000 young people to serve in their communities, solving problems and earning money for college."", 'Now we must do more. I want that bridge to the 21st century to be one where computers are as much of the part of the classroom as blackboards, where highly trained teachers expect, demand, and get peak performance from all of our students, where every 8-year-old can point to a book and say, ""I read it all by myself.""', 'I want us to build a bridge to the 21st century which makes at least 2 years of college as universal as a high school education is today. I propose a $1,500 tuition tax credit, a HOPE scholarship to make the typical community college available to every single American, a refundable tax credit to cover the costs of tuition. I believe we should give our families a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year for the cost of any education after high school, 4 years of college and graduate school, whatever it takes. This kind of investment would be good for America. I believe we should let families save in an IRA, an individual retirement account, and withdraw from it, if necessary, to pay for an education without any penalty.', ""But we must do more. Forty percent of our 8-year-olds cannot read as well as they should. But every child—every child should be able to read on his or her own by the third grade. I propose to send 30,000 reading specialists into our communities to work with volunteers, to mobilize an army of volunteers with the help of our young AmeriCorps people, with the help of college students on work-study, to mobilize up to one million tutors so that every single child in this country who needs a tutor can get one, so that by the time all of our children are 8 they can read on their own. They can't learn the rest of the way unless they can read young."", 'I want to connect every classroom and library in every school in America to the information superhighway by the year 2000, not just computers and trained teachers but a connection to the vast array of knowledge that is now available at the fingertips of anyone who knows how to use it.', 'Think of what this means, my fellow Americans. If we can do this it means that, for the first time in the entire history of the United States, children in the poorest rural classroom, in the remotest area of America, children in the poorest inner-city classrooms, in the most isolated parts of America, for the first time will have access to the same information in the same way at the same level of quality as the children in the richest schools in America. This will democratize education in a way we have never done before ever in our history.', 'I want the United States Government to help our local school districts for the first time in helping to rebuild dilapidated schools and build new ones in the areas that are growing and do not have the resources to do it on their own. We have never done this, but I see over and over and over again as the largest class of students in American history start school this year, you cannot expect these children to learn if they are in circumstances that are absolutely deplorable. And if local people will do their part to do more, we will help them to do more so that we can build the schools of the 21st century.', ""Now, if we do these things, every 8-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old will be able to log in on the Internet, every 18-yearold will be able to go to college. That's a bridge worth building. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'I want to build a bridge to the 21st century in which all Americans take personal responsibility for themselves and their families and their communities and for our country. I want every child to grow up in a community where work is the standard, where earning a paycheck is a thing of pride. The welfare reform law I signed gives millions of Americans a chance, but not a certainty, to have that new kind of beginning.', 'We fought hard to keep the guarantees of health care, school lunches, nutrition and child care for children and families. But this new law also says, from now on, able-bodied people must work for the income check.', ""Now, I strongly believe that. I was proud and I was proud to see you clapping when I said the welfare rolls were smaller by 1.8 million in the last 4 years. A strong economy helped that to happen. But the experiments, the work we've been doing with people like Governor Chiles to help people move from welfare to work, has also helped."", ""So I say to you, it's all very well for the Congress or the Governors to say, okay, we have a new system and everybody who is able-bodied has to work, but to make that morally defensible and practically possible, there has to be work for those people to do."", 'I want to tell you about some of the things we are doing to help create more work in the inner cities, in other poor areas, for people on welfare, for single, unemployed men who depend upon food stamps but don\'t have welfare and can\'t find jobs. Under this law, every State—when it becomes effective, every State in the country can say to any employer, any private sector business, any non-profit organization, and any church, anybody that employs people—now the State can say, ""If you will hire somebody off welfare, we\'ll give you the welfare check as a supplement for the wages and the training.""', ""It means, folks, when you go back home, your church could receive a person's welfare check and add to it only a modest amount of money to make a living wage and to take some time to train people and bring their children into the church and make sure their children are all right and give them a home and a family."", 'Will you do that? Will you go home and consider hiring somebody from welfare to work if your State will give you some money to help you do it? I want every pastor in this audience to think about it. Just think about it. If every church in America hired one person off welfare, if every church in America could get some help to do that, it would set an example that would require the business community to follow, that would require charitable and other nonprofit organizations to follow. We cannot create a Government jobs program big enough to solve this whole thing, but if everybody did it one by one, we could do this job. We could give those folks the work we promised and expect the responsibility we ask in that law. And I hope you will consider doing that. You could make all the difference in the world.', 'We must do more for businesses. I propose to give an extra tax credit for people who hire folks off welfare. I propose to give private job placement firms, who do a good job of placing other people, funds if they place people from welfare to work and they stay there.', 'I want to have 3 times as many empowerment zones as the ones we now have in cities like Chicago and New York and Baltimore and Kansas City. I want to have 3 times as many of those, because I have seen in Detroit alone, $2 billion in private section investment poured into inner-city Detroit. The unemployment rate in 3 years dropped from 8 1/2 percent to under 4 percent. We can bring jobs back to the inner city when business understands that the greatest market for American business are people in America who are underemployed and unemployed in places that need new investment. I hope you will support that approach as well.', ""I propose to create more community development banks, 3 times as many empowerment zones. I propose an investment fund to help our cities put welfare recipients to work immediately, repairing schools, making their neighborhoods clean and safer. We can do this, but we're all going to have to work at it. And I want you to help me build that bridge to the 21st century that says if we tell you you have to work, we're going to make sure you have work to do. There's plenty to do in this country, we just have to organize it so we can all do it together. I want you to help me do that."", ""I want to build a bridge to the 21st century in which all Americans live in strong, healthy communities. If you will give us 4 more years, we'll clean up two-thirds of the toxic waste sites that are still out there so our children can grow up in every community next to parks, not poison. It's wrong that 10 million children live within 4 miles of toxic waste sites, and we can change it. We want to clean up the ones that blot our urban centers, called brownfields. We can do that, create more jobs in the cities, attract more business and development by cleaning the environment."", 'I want to build a bridge to the 21st century where we have stronger families and we help our parents to raise their children and to protect them. Proverbs says, ""Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it."" That is why we passed the Family and Medical Leave Act and why we want to expand it; why we have done our best to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of cigarettes to children; why we are giving parents the V-chip to help them screen out inappropriate television shows; why we are helping parents and communities to give our young people both discipline and values through supporting communities who decide on their own to have curfew policies, tougher truancy laws, school uniform programs.', 'All these things are our way of saying to communities and parents, we want to help you do the job that we know you want to do. We want people to succeed at home and at work. If America cannot succeed at home and at work, and do both, America cannot succeed.', 'Finally, let me say, I know here above all I am preaching to the choir, but I want you to help me build a bridge to the 21st century that can only be built by all of us together. Nothing we do will matter if we cannot heal the divisions and bigotry that still crop up in this country from time to time.', ""That is why I have said on affirmative action, we ought to make it better, we should mend it, but it's not time to end it. That is why I put the full force of my office behind the effort to stop the rash of church burnings that have plagued us in recent months. And let me say, I know, as church people and as Americans, you feel exactly the same way whenever you see a white church burned, a synagogue defaced, or an Islamic center destroyed. It's wrong for everybody. It's wrong for everybody."", ""If you look around the world, folks, it's amazing how much time I have to spend as your President trying to get other people to lay down their hatreds. And what are these hatreds rooted in—in the Middle East, in Northern Ireland, in Bosnia, in Rwanda and Burundi? What are they rooted in? Religious, racial, ethnic, tribal hatreds. People get in the habit of living so that they define themselves and how good they are by how bad their neighbors are, how holy they are in their faith by how unholy people who have another faith are, how righteous they are by how evil people who are different are. And it is a miserable way to live. It is self defeating."", 'Why in the wide world people would tear up that beautiful little country of Bosnia? Yes, they have different religions and, yes, they have different ethnic labels, but the truth is, biologically they\'re not different. It is a product of historical accident. For decades, they lived in peace together. Sarajevo, one of the beautiful cities in the world—why do they keep doing this? What is it in the human heart that we have to purge? How wise were our Founders not to make America a place where you had to do anything but believe in the values of the Constitution. How wise was Thomas Jefferson to know that the great hypocrisy in our founding was slavery when he said, ""I tremble—when I think of slavery, I tremble to think that God is just.""', ""And now we are struggling not only to deal with the relationships between African-Americans and the majority community, with all of the progress we've made in over 200 years, but also the fact that the fastest growing minority in America are the Hispanic-Americans; the fact that we had 197 nations represented at the Olympics—in our largest county, Los Angeles County, there are people from 150 of those places, in only one American county."", ""Now, if you look at the world we are living in and the one toward which we are going, if we can all get along together, that's going to be the greatest asset any country in the world has. We have folks here from everywhere."", ""I gave a speech a few years ago to one of the California State University campuses in Los Angeles, and there were people in the student body in one school from 122 different national, racial, and ethnic groups, in one school. That is an enormous asset in a global world, where we're all being drawn closer together."", ""On the other hand, if we fall into the trap that is strangling country after country after country and think the only way we can amount to something, the only way we can be somebody is to find somebody else to look down on, we're in for big trouble because we've got more of that than any country in the world does—all of this difference."", ""So I say to you, no people in this country have suffered more or longer than African-Americans from discrimination, but you know you will never and can never become what you wish to be by returning that in kind. That is the lesson you must teach others. That's why I react so strongly to these church burnings, because I see how other countries have been consumed."", ""I see how far we've come in my own lifetime. I see that bright, shining future out there where there will be more possibilities for our children to do more things than ever before. In 10 years, our children will be doing jobs that have not been invented yet. They will be doing work that has not been imagined yet. I just approved a joint venture with IBM to develop a supercomputer within the next couple of years that will be able to do more calculations in a second than you can go home and pick up a pocket calculator and do in 30,000 years. That's how much change is going on. It's got to be a good thing for America."", 'And it can only be a good thing if we go forward together—if we say, ""If you believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, and you\'re willing to show up and do right tomorrow, you\'re my kind of American. I don\'t care what your race is; I don\'t care what your religion is; I don\'t care where you started out in life. We\'re going to join arm in arm and go across that bridge together."" Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', 'Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you.']"
62,William J. Clinton ,"September 06, 1996","[""Thank you. Let me say—well, sit down and relax here. [Laughter] First of all, I want to thank Christy Grabowski. It's not the easiest thing in the world to stand up here in front of all of you and do this, and she did a great job, didn't she? Let's give her a hand. [Applause]"", 'I thank Governor Chiles and Lieutenant Governor MacKay for being here. And thank you, Governor Chiles, for what you said and for your support of education and especially of these community colleges. I thank your Congresswoman Corrine Brown, who is also here, along with Congressman John Conyers from Michigan. Thank you very much.', ""Dr. Kinser, thank you for welcoming me here. And to your Board of Trustees chair, Marcia Tompkins, thank you for making me feel welcome here. I know we have three people who are trying to go to the Congress, George Stuart, John Byron, and Al Krulick; thank you for coming. I hope you'll support these programs and tell people you do."", ""I want to thank Bob Koch and Tom Christian for speaking here first, to talk along with Dr. Kinser about the work that Valencia has done with AT&T, with Lucent, with the IBEW Local 2000, all working together. That is how I think America ought to work, and that's why I'm here today. America ought to work more like you work in this community college. You are truly building that bridge to the 21st century that I talked to the American people about in Chicago last week."", ""You know, I spent a wonderful several days before and after the Democratic National Convention first on a train going through West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana, and then on a bus going through Missouri and Illinois and Kentucky and Tennessee before I went back home. And I saw all kinds of people there. If you get out on the back roads of America and you go to places that normally Presidents don't visit, you see the people that really deserve to be worked for and fought for. But you can also see them if you go to any community college in the United States of America, because that's where our—[applause]."", ""Community colleges represent what I think America ought to be, because it is opportunity for all, no matter who you are or what your background is. People are, by definition, responsible because no one's giving you anything except a chance. And there is a real community, that is, people band together across the lines that too often divide us, across lines of race, religion, gender, economy, you name it. All you've got to do is show up and play by the rules, and you're part of this community. That's the way America ought to work; that's the way I want America to work in the 21st century."", ""This strategy is working. Just today we learned that we had more good economic news: 250,000 more new jobs for Americans in the month of July. That means we have now seen the American economy produce, since January of 1993, 10 1/2 million new jobs. The national unemployment rate, the national rate is now 5.1 percent, the lowest in 7 1/2 years. This country is moving in the right direction. We're on the right track for the 21st century."", ""I think it's very important to me that you understand that one of the reasons we've been able to create the conditions and give Americans the tools to make the most of their own lives is that I have tried to change the way our national politics work so that it would work more like you work here. I want to move beyond what I consider to be the hot-air rhetoric of American politics of who's to blame and focus more on what to do. What are we going to do to move this country forward? And I just want to talk very briefly about two things that are very important, the focus of the work of the community college: the economy and education."", ""The first thing we have to do is, we have to keep this economic growth going. We know that there are business cycles that go up and down, but we also know that countries have periods where they're growing and periods when they're not. And we had too long when too many people worked harder and harder and harder just to hang on by their fingernails, just to barely support their kids, never getting a raise, never looking forward to a better future."", ""We now have seen not only 10 1/2 million new jobs but record numbers of new businesses formed and wages finally going up again for the first time in a decade. We need to keep that going. That's what we have to keep going. We need to make sure—and that means that we have to have the right kind of conditions, first of all, in which our economy can grow. And I'll just mention two or three."", 'First of all, I want to mention something that every political consultant that I ever talked to says never works. They say—for years I\'ve been told, ""Oh, Bill, don\'t talk about the deficit except when the economy is bad. When the economy is bad, people really worry about the deficit. When the economy is good, they could give a rip about it; it bores them. They want to hear about tax cuts."" Well, what I want to tell you is, the reason the economy is good is because this is the first administration since before the Civil War that brought the deficit down in every year, bringing interest rates down, making investment possible, making the economy grow.', ""It is imperative that we stay on this path to balancing the budget, because we've got to keep the interest rates down so we can have more companies affording to borrow the money to invest, to build the new facilities, to create the new jobs, to raise the incomes; not to mention the fact that if interest rates are down, for you that means lower home payments, car payments, and interest rate payments. So it's very important. We've got to keep the economy going."", ""The second thing we have to do is to have tax cuts that are paid for, therefore, as Governor Chiles said. That's why, yes, I want tax cuts for education, for childrearing, for people to save in an IRA and be able to withdraw taxfree for education or buying a new home or a health care emergency; but we've got to pay for them. They have to be paid for in the context of balancing the budget. And that's the critical distinction here."", 'Now, the third thing we have to do is to invest enough money on your behalf, for you as a country, to grow the economy. That means we have to invest in research. That means we have to invest in education. And let me just give you a couple of examples that would really affect Florida.', ""I think if we build a bridge to the 21st century that's the right kind of bridge, it will be very much a bridge that will keep America on the cutting edge of all the latest investments in new technology. That means we have to keep the economy growing with projects like the proposed high-speed rail project here in Florida. And I support that, and I will do what I can to continue to support it with flexibility, with resources, with cutting redtape. The Lieutenant Governor talks to me about that every time I see him. I haven't yet wanted to run away from him when I see him because I don't get tired of hearing about it, but these are important issues. I'll give you another example."", ""We have to continue to invest money in research. A lot of you were very moved I'm sure at our convention when Christopher Reeve gave that passionate speech about research. But let me tell you, we now have for the first time ever laboratory animals that were—sustained serious spinal cord injuries, that were paraplegic, that had nerve transplants and for the first time ever moved their lower limbs. The boundaries of medical research are enormous. In the last 4 years, research and the more rapid movement of drugs to market has more than doubled— more than doubled in only 4 years—the life expectancy of people with HIV and AIDS—way more than doubled in only 4 years."", ""We are making breathtaking discoveries in what can be done to preserve the environment while you're growing the economy, whether it's in agriculture or industry, through research. The Internet, something a lot of you use regularly now, you should know, is the product of Government research. It was first developed in a Government research project. Then when it had commercial potential, the Government did exactly what should be done. The Government got out of it, let the private sector run it so it could grow in the proper way."", 'We are now building with IBM—I heard you talking about the computer chip and the transistor capacity—we are building with IBM a supercomputer that will be finished in a few years that, when finished, will have the capacity to do in one second the number of calculations it would take you on a hand-held calculator 30,000 years to do.', ""So I say to you, when people tell you that the Government's all bad and all that, just remember, research is an important part of our common future. Technology is an important part of our common future. You are going to be trained here for jobs—when I look at Christy talking—for jobs that some day in the past were just a gleam in someone's eye, were just part of someone's imagination. And the young people in this audience, within a decade, will be doing jobs that have not been invented yet. Some of them will be doing jobs that have not even been imagined yet. So we have to keep the economy growing."", 'The second thing we have to do, if you look out across this sea of students here, is we have to find a way to grow together and to give, with all of our diversity, everybody who is willing to work for it a chance to live up to their own God-given capacity. And there is no other way to do it except through education; there is no other way to do it. There is no shortcut.', ""Now, it is true that in the last 4 years we've tried to do a lot, everything from expanding Head Start to helping the schools do a better job, to lowering the cost and improving the repayment terms on college loans and saving the education programs, especially the financial aid programs, from the assault of the Congress in the last budget. We did do that, but we have to do more."", ""And let me just say, I want to mention three or four things that I think are very important. One involves our younger children. Forty percent of the 8-year-olds in this country can still not read on their own. And that is wrong. It is very hard for people to get where you are today unless they can learn what they're supposed to learn at each step along the way. Yes, it's true that you may be—a lot of you probably are nontraditional students or considerably— maybe you're in your late twenties, your thirties, your forties, your fifties, maybe even in your sixties, maybe even older, but you have to learn what you're supposed to learn at each step along the way."", ""One of the things that I think is very important to do in building that bridge to the 21st century in the next 4 years is to mobilize a corps of reading mentors—from AmeriCorps volunteers, from work-study students in college, from others that we can bring in and pay for— to get other volunteers, up to a million volunteers to make sure that every 8-year-old can read on his or her own by the year 2000, every single one. That's important."", ""The second thing that I think it's important to get—this goes back to technology and research and some work that I have seen done by AT&T and by Bell Atlantic and others in other school districts in the country—but it's very important to understand what the Internet means in terms of education of children. We are trying to, right now—we've had a project going where we've had 100,000 teachers teaching 500,000 more how to make the most of computers in the classroom, and we are working to get every school the computers that they need, good educational software, and trained teachers."", ""But it's very important to understand that if you do all of that and you can hook up every classroom and library in America to the Internet by the year 2000, it will make it possible for the first time in American history—think about this—for the children in the most isolated rural districts in the mountains of Appalachia or in the far plains of North Dakota and the children in the most isolated inner-city urban areas in the poorest school districts to have access in the same way at the same time at the same level of quality and quantity to the information that the children in the wealthiest districts in America have. It has never happened before. This is an enormously significant thing. And it could democratize education in a way we never have been able to do before. And if we do all those things, that's important. Then you would have—every 8-year-old would be able to read, every 12-year-old could log in on the Internet, and high school graduates all over America could be expected to meet the same high standards."", ""It's still not enough, you and I know. If you just look at the census or you look at your own experience—do we need a doctor here? We're okay? I asked my medical team to show up here. That's the Presidential service; we carry people everywhere. [Laughter]"", ""But let me say, it's not enough. We already know. You wouldn't be here if you didn't know this, but let me tell you, I first saw it when I reviewed the 1990 Census, which may look like a boring document to a lot of people, but it tells you what's happening to America. It took my breath away to see how the earnings of our people were dividing by education, not by race, not by region, not by anything, by education."", ""And we know now that people who have a community college degree are likely to get jobs in industries with a good future, with the prospect of a growing income. We also know that people who don't, who have less, are likely not to. So I say to you, we can't build the bridge to the future we want and give everybody a chance unless we say we want to make it possible for every person to go to a community college, and we're going to make 2 years of education after high school just as universal in 4 years as a high school diploma is today. And I want you to help me do that."", ""If we provide a refundable tax credit of up to $1,500 a year, we can cover the costs through a tax cut of the tuition at the typical community college in any State in the country, and we can revolutionize access to community college. That's what I want. That's my idea of the HOPE scholarship. And it is modeled on a program I saw in Georgia and on a more limited thing we tried to do at home when I was Governor of Arkansas. I just think we ought to say, okay, you get out of high school, you get into community college, here's your tax credit, we'll pay your way; you've just got to do a good job, keep your grades up, and keep going, and we'll see you through it. For those who go on, let me say again, I think we ought to have a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year for the cost of any education after high school."", ""For people who lose their jobs and who are underemployed, who used to have to wonder whether they were eligible or not for some Government training program, I propose collapsing—because nearly every American is within driving distance of a community college— I propose collapsing all these different Government training programs into one big block and saying, if you're eligible because you're unemployed or grossly underemployed, we'll give you a skills grant and you can take it where you want. You're all within driving distance of a community college; go get it."", ""There are many other things that we have to do to build that bridge to the 21st century. We have to make it possible for families to succeed at home and at work. That's why I'm for an IRA that you can contribute to and withdraw without penalty for education, for the firsttime homebuying, for medical emergency. That's why I don't think people should ever have to pay taxes when they sell a home and they buy another one, on the gain. That's why I believe that we have to do more to expand the Family and Medical Leave Act so parents can take a little time off from work to go to their children's parent-teacher conference. I think these things are important."", 'We have to find a way—we have had 4 years of declining crime rates. It has been a long time since America has done that. But we need 4 more. And after 4 more years, if we could put together 8 years of declining crime rates, it might finally be down to a bearable level. We have to keep putting these police officers on the street. We have to keep finding ways to keep our kids out of trouble and giving them things to say yes to, not just things to say no to. We have to keep working on that.', ""We have to find a way not just to talk about welfare reform but to do it. Now, we've moved 1.8 million people—1,800,000 people—from welfare to work since I've been President. Now we passed the welfare reform bill that says, we'll give you health care, we'll give you nutrition, we'll give you child care, but if you're ablebodied, you have to go to work. Now there has to be work for those folks to do. We have to work on making sure that we create those jobs for people who have lower skills and that we don't block them off from coming back to community college or doing other things that will raise their skills."", ""I will say again, we have to find a way to grow the economy while protecting the environment. We still have 10 million of our children living within 4 miles of toxic waste dumps. Even though we've cleaned up more in the last 3 years than we did in the previous 12, I want to do better. If we clean up the two-thirds worst then we can say our children are growing up next to parks, not poison, and we're growing the economy while we're doing it. And I want you to help me do that. That's important."", 'Again I will say, we have to grow the economy and we have to grow together through educational opportunity and through a belief that the country ought to run the way a community college runs. You have no idea how much time I have to spend as your President on foreign policy problems that arise because people in other parts of the world insist upon hating each other because of their religious, their racial, their ethnic, or their tribal differences.', ""And if you look around at America now, look around this room—I've told many people, when the Olympics came to Atlanta and we had people there from 197 different national and ethnic groups, our biggest county, Los Angeles County, had over 150 of those groups represented in one American county. This is not a country where we define ourselves by our race, our religion, our ethnic group. Everybody is welcome here who believes in the Constitution and is willing to stand up and work for what's right."", 'Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause] I want you to help because you represent where we all need to go.', 'Thank you, and God bless you.']"
63,William J. Clinton ,"September 06, 1996","[""The President. Thank you. Wow! Well, on the way up here Governor Chiles told me that— can you hear? We lost our sound. Can you hear me in the back? I'll just speak up—there it is. On the way up here Governor Chiles told me that as nearly as they could determine, I am the first sitting President ever to come to Panama City. Based on what I saw along the road coming in and the reception you've given us, I'd say the others don't know what they were missing. I'm glad to be here. [Applause] Thank you."", ""I'd like to thank President McSpadden and all the others here at the community college for making me feel so welcome. I'd like to thank these excellent young musicians who played for us, called the Optimistics. They were great, weren't they? Thank you very much."", 'Thank you, Dawn, for the power of your example and for your fine introduction, but mostly because you embody what the American dream is all about and the role of education in the American dream. I know all of you here who are students must have been very proud when Dawn Roberts was up here speaking, but I was proud just to be an American, to know that we have people like this and that there are opportunities like this school has given her to make the most of her own life.', ""I'd like to thank all the military people who serve our country who live in this area. And I'd like to thank all the people who work for Sallie Mae here, who have worked so hard to make college education affordable."", 'I want to thank Governor Lawton Chiles for being my friend of many years and for what he said today. A lot of people say, ""Well, why are you going up there? They never vote for Democrats."" And I said, ""Well, I remember when Lawton Chiles ran for Governor in 1994, and the Republicans said it was their year and that people in Florida would never reelect him. He kept coming up here and saying that he was going to remind everybody that the ‘hecoon\' walked just before the light of dawn. And I figured if I came up here, maybe I could find myself a ‘he-coon.""\' So I\'m looking around trying to find one.', ""I thought I had personally used every downhome expression known to man until he said that. [Laughter] And I'm still learning things from Lawton Chiles after all of these years."", ""I want to say a special word of thanks and honor to your retiring Congressman, Pete Peterson. He has—as all of you know, he has served his country magnificently and at great sacrifice to himself and his family for a very long time, and I honor him. And I was honored to be able to nominate him to be our Nation's first Ambassador to Vietnam since the end of the Vietnam war. He will be terrific at it."", ""Now, in order for me to see his nomination through, I have to get my contract renewed. But if I do, that's a campaign commitment you can put in the bank. He will be the next Ambassador to Vietnam."", 'Ladies and gentlemen, it\'s hot in here, and I\'m proud you came to see me, and most of what I have to say is preaching to the saved; I realize that. But I want to emphasize to you why we are here, not in Panama City, but why we are here at this community college, because I believe America ought to work the way the community colleges in America work. I believe they are the ultimate democratic institution, small ""d"": open to everybody, where everybody has a chance; results oriented; flexible, not bureaucratic; working in partnership with the private sector; guaranteeing opportunity for everybody who is responsible enough to seek it.', ""This is the way America ought to work. And this is what I have tried to work on for 4 years as President. I was sick and tired of seeing Washington politics dominated by hot air, negative charges. And I sought to bring an end to the politics of who's to blame, and to substitute for that, what are we going to do to make America a better place?"", ""I think it's plain that America is on the right track to the 21st century. We got some more information today: Last month our economy created another 250,000 jobs; our unemployment rate—as a nation our unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 percent, the lowest in 7 1/2 years; wages are going up again for the first time in a decade. We have record numbers of new small businesses, record numbers of American exports all over the world. Our auto production is number one again in the world for the first time since the 1970's; homeownership at a 15-year high."", 'The minimum wage will go into effect, the increase, in October, and it will raise wages for 10 million of the hardest-working working people in this country. I think that\'s a good thing. Twenty-five million Americans, including some of you in this audience, I\'ll bet, will be helped by the passage of the Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform bill, which says to Americans, ""You cannot lose your health insurance or be denied it if you change jobs or just because someone in your family has been sick."" That\'s what insurance is for.', ""For the first time since before the Civil War, in the 1840's, we have reduced the Government's enormous budget deficit in all 4 years, a total of 60 percent, for the first time in well over 100 years. We can be proud of that. We are moving in the right direction. We're on the right track."", ""There are 1.8 million fewer people on welfare than there were the day I took the oath of office. Child support collections are up 40 percent and up 48 percent in Florida. Thank you, Governor, and thank you, Florida; you're doing a good job."", ""We have worked hard to make sure that America would be the strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity in the world. We have undertaken what anyone would say is the most successful restructuring of military forces in history. We have maintained the capabilities, the readiness, the qualitative edge of our Armed Forces. You heard Governor Chiles say it, but I want to say it again: I'm glad that the F- 22's are going to be headquartered here, and I know you will do a good job of helping to maintain America's defense."", ""But we still have more to do if we're going to build a bridge to the 21st century that everybody can walk across. We've got to keep economic growth going, which means we have to balance the budget without unfair cuts in education, in environmental protection, in research and technology, in Medicare and Medicaid. We've got to go forward together, investing in the things that will make us stronger. We have to give the right kind of tax cuts to America's families. They ought to be focused on raising children, on education, on emergency needs like health care, on buying that first home. And we ought to pay for our tax cuts and not have to cut Medicare, Medicaid, or education, the environment more."", 'And we ought not to let that deficit go up. Last year, before they changed their position, our friends in the Republican Party put out one piece of paper that I agree with. They said, ""If we get off this plan to balance the budget and we send a signal that we don\'t care about it anymore, interest rates will go up 2 percent."" Now, people always tell me, ""Don\'t ever talk about balancing the budget. When the economy is good, people get bored by it. They only care about it when the economy is bad."" You should care about it. If interest rates go up 2 percent because the Government is borrowing money when you\'re trying to borrow it, that means 2 percent on a home mortgage, on a car payment, on a credit card payment. Even more important than that, it means 2 percent for every business person that wants to borrow money to start a new business, to expand a business, to become more productive so that more people can be hired and more can get a raise. We\'ve got to keep working to balance the budget in the right way to grow the economy.', 'We passed a welfare reform bill that says to everybody on welfare now, ""We\'ll take care of your children with health care, with nutrition, with child care. But if you\'re able-bodied, you have to go to work."" We\'ve got to make sure there\'s work to do for those people. We have to create those jobs so they can go to work.', ""The crime rate has come down in America for 4 years in a row. But we have to finish the work of putting 100,000 police on the street, and we have to continue to work to protect those who are trying to protect us. You know, in places like this part of Florida and nearly every place in my home State of Arkansas, when we passed the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban, the awfullest hue and cry you ever heard went up, and all of these hunters were told that we were coming after their rifles. The truth is, for the first time in American history, we've protected 650 hunting and sporting weapons from any infringement by the Government. They neglected to say that in the political rhetoric 2 years ago. But here we are, 2 years later, and every hunting season every hunter in Florida and Arkansas is still using the same rifle unless they chose to get another one."", ""But to be fair and completely honest, there were some people who couldn't get guns anymore: 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers could not get them because of the Brady bill. We were right, and they were wrong."", 'Now, for reasons I will never understand, our friends in the opposition not only oppose us on that, they oppose putting 100,000 police officers on the street. Folks, when Hillary and I and Al and Tipper Gore took our bus trip after the convention through all of those little towns in Missouri, in Illinois, in Kentucky, in Tennessee, I went to some little towns where the police chief came up to me and said, ""Mr. President, because of that 100,000 police program, in our little town we\'ve doubled the size of our police department, and we cut the crime rate in half. Don\'t let them stop this program."" This is something that\'s protecting all Americans, from the biggest cities to the smallest towns. So if you want to build a bridge to the 21st century for everybody, then our children have a right to be safe in their homes, on their streets, in their schools, in their future.', ""We've got to build a bridge to the 21st century that enables us to grow the economy and protect the environment at the same time. Ten million American children still live within 4 miles of a toxic waste site; that's wrong. We've cleaned up more in 3 years than the previous administrations did in 12, but if you'll give me 4 more years, we'll clean up two-thirds of the rest, the worst, so that our kids will be growing up next to parks, not poison. And let me say this——"", 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. This is so important to Florida. You're growing so fast, but people come here because it's a beautiful place, because they love it. You have to find a way to grow and preserve the environment. Whether it's the quality of water, the Florida Everglades, all of the resources you have, Florida has as big a stake in America finding a way to balance environmental preservation and restoration and economic growth as any other State in America. And that is my solemn commitment to you. That's what we've done, and we're going to do more of it to build that bridge to the 21st century."", ""Let me just mention something else. When Dawn introduced me and talked a little bit about herself, I thought to myself: I wonder how many nontraditional students there are who have to balance work and school and taking care of kids. I bet a lot of you do. I never go into a crowd of ordinary Americans that I don't hear somebody talk to me about how one of their biggest concerns is how they can succeed in their work life and succeed in raising their children, in their home life."", ""Since most American parents, whether they're single parents or in two-parent households, are both working and parenting, I think you can make a compelling case that our country has no more important responsibility than doing everything in our power to help the American people succeed with their first and most important job, raising their children, and at work— both of them."", 'Now, when we pass—when the first bill I signed was the family and medical leave law, our friends in the other party, the leader said, ""Oh, this is terrible for the economy. You will bankrupt the economy. This is awful. There won\'t be any small businesses can live with this.""', ""Well, 4 years later, 12 million American families have been able to take a little time off for the birth of a child or a parent's illness without losing their jobs, and we have in every single one of these 4 years started a record number of new small businesses in America. And the job growth rate in these 4 years has been faster than in any Republican administration in over 70 years. I think that we were right about that."", ""So I'd like to see us expand the family leave law just a little so that parents could have a little time off to go to regular parent-teacher conferences and regular doctor's appointments with their children. I think it would be a good thing to do. I'd like to see parents who have to work and get overtime have the choice of taking that overtime in cash, if that's what's best in their family, or in time, if that's what's best for their family, to support work and family."", ""And finally, let me say the most important thing and the reason I'm here today is that we've got to build a bridge to the 21st century that everyone can walk across, to a century where everybody who is responsible and willing to work has a chance to live their own version of the American dream and live up to their God-given capacities. And there is no way to do it unless we provide in this tough, competitive global economy the finest educational opportunities of any nation in the world to every single person who lives in the United States."", 'Now, as Lawton Chiles will tell you, I could keep you here until dawn—and then we\'d see that ""he-coon""—talking about education. I don\'t want to do that. But I want to tell you just three or four things that I think it\'s important that we do. Some of them affect you directly; some of them affect you indirectly.', 'Forty percent of the 8-year-olds in this country cannot read a book on their own—40 percent. Every child needs to be able to read a book by the time they\'re 8 and in the third grade. I propose—I propose to support our schools with 30,000 more mentors, AmeriCorps volunteers, college students on work study, other volunteers, to mobilize a million citizens to help children learn to read one-on-one so that by the year 2000 we can say, ""We built a bridge to the future. Every 8-year-old can read a book. Every 8-year-old, by himself.""', ""I believe—I bet a lot of you are a lot more proficient on your computer than I am and hook into the Internet all the time. We're working hard not only to provide every classroom and library in America with adequate computers, adequate educational programming, and properly trained teachers—this summer we started a program with 100,000 teachers to train 500,000 more, to make sure the teachers could actually teach the kids—and a little bit of it will be the other way around—in how to make the most of computers for educational purposes."", 'But the real key is hooking all these computers up to the information superhighway, to the Internet, to the World Wide Web. You think about it. This is the first time in the history of the country when kids in the smallest towns in Florida and in the poorest inner-city neighborhoods anywhere in America can be able to get the same information at the same quality in the same time in the same way as children in the wealthiest school districts in this country. It will revolutionize education and lift our entire country. And we have to build that bridge to the 21st century.', 'And finally, I believe we have to make it possible for every single American of any age to go back to school at any time when they need to go back to school, starting with making 2 years of college, a community college degree, just as universal in 4 years as a high school diploma is today. And we can do that. We can do that. Because, thank goodness, almost every American is within driving distance of a community college, it won\'t be that hard. What we ought to do is to give every family up to 2 years of a $1,500 refundable tax credit which will cover the typical tuition cost at any community college in the country. And that will help us to say to everybody, ""It doesn\'t matter what age you are. It doesn\'t matter whether other people in your family are going to college, doesn\'t matter what your other problems are. Through the tax system, we\'ll pay you to go back to a community college if you\'ll do a good job while you\'re there, work hard, learn, and go forward.""', 'And for people that go further, I think we ought to give families a tax deduction worth up to $10,000 a year for the cost of tuition at any form of higher education, undergraduate, graduate, you name it. We ought to do that as well and encourage people to go forward.', 'Again I say, you can only believe in this if you really believe not only in your own potential but the potential of every other American. This is a great country not because we are committed to one particular religious view, one particular racial view, one particular ethnic group. This is a country now where everybody can come, and we say, ""If you believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, if you\'re willing to work hard and show up tomorrow and play by the rules, you\'re our kind of American. You\'re part of our future."" We want to build a bridge that you can walk across because we\'ll be stronger, too. We\'ll be stronger, too.', ""So I want to ask you—that's what this election is all about: a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past; a bridge to the future wide enough that we can all walk across or everybody trying to build their own little bridge and say we're on our own. I believe that my wife was right; I think it does take a village. We're better off when we help each other."", ""I believe that there is no country in the world—I don't just believe it, I know this— there is no country in the world as well-positioned for the 21st century as the United States. But we have to make some fundamental decisions. Do we really believe in opportunity for all, responsibility from all? Do we really believe that everybody who is willing to work hard has a part in our American community? If we believe that, and we're willing to build that bridge, America's greatest days are still ahead."", 'Will you help me build that bridge?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President.

Our Republican friends said something last year I agree with. They said if we had no plan to balance the budget, interest rates would be 2 percent higher, so the Government would be borrowing money, the same money you're trying to borrow. You know what that means? You figure it out when you go home tonight. What would 2 percent mean on your home mortgage, your car payment, your credit card payments? It's a lot of money. What would 2 percent mean to all these business people? You want to borrow money in St. Louis and start new businesses or extend their businesses so they can hire more people. That's a lot of money. It would be bad for the economy."", ""So we say, yes, let's balance the budget, but let's do it without gutting Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment.

I want to give the American families a tax deduction for the cost of any tuition after high school, undergraduate, postgraduate, you name it, at any age, up to $10,000 a year. Will you help me do that? [Applause]"", ""That's the kind of bridge I want to build to the 21st century. I believe that we owe it to the children and to their parents to build a country in which people can succeed at home, raising their kids, and at work; where everyone who wants to get another education or more education has the chance to do it; where we say, you do not have to wreck the fabric of America's community to balance the budget. If you do it in the right way, it will make America a stronger community. That is the kind of America I want to build."", ""And let me tell you, folks—this election, you just heard, is 56 days from today, 8 weeks from today. In the next 8 weeks you think about how many people you're going to speak with. Think about all your friends and family members, everybody you might talk to on the telephone living inside or beyond the borders of the State of Missouri. And I want to just ask you to remember this—this is a wonderful rally; you've made me very happy today—but I want you to remember what I said. These are big choices, and the choices you make in the races for Congress and the choice you make in the Presidential race is a choice that has more to do with you than us. It has more to do with these children. They have all their tomorrows in front of them. And we owe it to them to make sure that our best days are still ahead. We owe it to them to make sure that the future is brighter than any of our glorious past."", 'And we can do it. We have it within our means if we have the vision and the will and if we make up our mind, each and every one of us, to be good citizens.', 'Yes, we have done a lot in the last 4 years, but the last 4 years is just an indication of what we can do in the next 4 and the years beyond if we will build that bridge together. Would you help me do that? [Applause]', ""Thank you. God bless you. Let's go get it.""]"

[Laughter]', 'Well, Rose Mofford did what she usually does, she stole the show already. [Laughter] Thank you, Governor. When I saw her backstage, she said, ""Well, I\'m still your adopted mother."" [Laughter] She and my mother had a lot in common. I have always loved Rose\'s irrepressible optimism and her very straightforward manner. And I can tell you this: When we served together as Governors, she loved the State of Arizona, and she took care of you. And I\'m glad to see her here today.', ""I want to thank my good friend Ed Pastor for being here with me today. He is a true leader in the Congress, leading for the people of Arizona, leading for the Hispanic Caucus, leading for the concerns of people all over the United States. And thank you, Dennis Jensen, and thank you very much for this beautiful bolo, which I will treasure. I collect them. I love to wear them when I have different attire on. [Laughter] I did wear my boots. If I'd known I was going to get a bolo, I wouldn't have worn a tie. [Laughter] Thank you very, very much. Is the gentleman who did that here? Stand up.

Thank you, Mayor Paul Johnson, from Phoenix, for being here. Thank you, Vice Mayor Crawford, from Tucson, for being here. Thank you, State Senator Sandra Kennedy.

The Temptations were singing when I came in the back. I heard them, and they were just great, weren't they? For a moment I thought I was crashing a dance instead of coming to a political meeting. [Laughter]"", 'I want to echo what has been said already about other distinguished Arizonans. I am personally very, very grateful to Bruce Babbitt for his willingness to serve in our administration and for the heroic fights he has taken on, to preserve our natural resources, to fight back on ill-advised attempts to sell some of our national parks, to help to save Yellowstone from a gold mine, to create in the Mojave Desert the largest national park in America south of Alaska, and to be a good steward of our national resources.', ""I was profoundly honored to present to Mo Udall's son Mark the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which I gave him a couple of days ago. And no American deserves it more. All of you can be very proud of that."", ""And I know I join all Americans in wishing Senator Goldwater well in his recovery. And let me tell you—you're probably like me—I first met Barry Goldwater 28 years ago when I was 21 years old—almost 29 years ago now. And he was giving a speech at the University of Arkansas at the invitation of Mack McLarty, who later became my Chief of Staff and is now the White House Counselor. And we were there. And I worked at the time for Senator Fulbright from Arkansas who, as some of you—maybe most of you know, was a Democrat. And he and Senator Goldwater had a great difference about the war in Vietnam which was the major issue back then. I will never forget how kind Barry Goldwater was to me as a 21-year-old college senior, a person he could never have known would amount to a hill of beans, and some of his fellow Republicans still think hasn't amounted to a hill of beans. [Laughter]"", ""I'll never forget that. But the thing that means the most to me is the incredible kindness and sensitivity he has shown toward the First Lady over the last 4 years. It means a great deal. So I wish him well. And I thank God for his civility and his service to our Nation."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to be here. I've had an interesting couple of weeks. A lot has been going on in the Nation's Capital, and a lot has been going on out in the country. We had our great convention in Chicago. And before that, I was on the rails, on the track to Chicago. And after that, Al and Tipper Gore and Hillary and I took a bus trip. And since then, I have been going back and forth to work in Washington and then back to the campaign trail when I could."", 'When I ran for President in 1992, I told the American people I had a very straightforward but profoundly important vision for our country in the 21st century; that we were going through this huge period of change in how we work and how we live and how we relate to each other and the rest of the world, a sweeping period of change; and that I wanted to see us manage this change into the next century in a way that kept the American dream alive for every single person in this country, that kept this country coming together as we grow ever more diverse and not being driven apart as so many nations are by their diversity, and that kept us the strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity in the world.', ""I said then, I reiterate today, I thought the only way to do that was to find a way to meet our challenges and protect the values that have made us the greatest country in history. And that our strategy should be simple, straightforward, and profound. We should work for opportunity for all, for responsibility from all, and for an American community that really is growing stronger together, where we respect each other for our shared values and we accept our differences, and we're proud of them because we know it makes us stronger and stronger, especially in a global society where there are people from all over the world with whom we must do business, with whom we must make peace, and with whom we must relate if we want to beat back the problems and seize the opportunities that the next century is going to offer us."", ""And for 4 years, I've worked on that. And I have to tell you that it may be a little immodest, but I think the evidence shows that we're better off than we were 4 years ago."", ""Look at the evidence. The latest evidence we have is that unemployment is down to a 7 1/2 year low—5.1 percent—in the Nation, the highest consumer confidence in years, 10 1/2 million new jobs. The economy is on the right track. We have almost 4 1/2 million new homeowners. Another 10 million homeowners have refinanced their mortgages at lower rates because we've been able to get those interest rates down. I see those folks everywhere. We have record numbers of new small businesses formed in each of the last 4 years. Our exports of American products and services are at an all-time high."", ""Twelve million Americans have been able to take advantage of the family and medical leave law to take a little time off for the birth of a baby or the illness of a parent without losing their job. Fifteen million of our hardest pressed working Americans got tax relief so that if you work 40 hours a week with children in the home, you'll never be in poverty now. That's very, very important."", ""Forty million Americans—and this is something that's important to a lot of people in this room—in 1994, we passed a bill to protect the pensions of 40 million Americans—40 million Americans."", 'Our air is cleaner. Our drinking water is safer. Our food is purer. We have closed more toxic waste dumps in the last 3 years than the previous administrations did in 12.', 'And in the last 2 weeks before Congress left office, we had some more good news. On October 1st, 10 million Americans will get an increase in the minimum wage. And every single small-business person in the country who invests more money in his or her business to make it more productive, to hire more people, to grow, will get a tax cut.', 'And 25 million Americans, because of the passage of the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, will be eligible not to lose their health insurance just because they got sick, someone in their family got sick, they had to change jobs. The minimum wage bill also made it easier for people in small businesses to take out pensions and for the employees in small businesses to keep those pensions if they move from job to job. And it gave families a $5,000 tax credit if they adopt children. So that bill was pro-work, pro-business, and pro-family. The country is moving in the right direction. We are moving in the right direction.', ""The welfare rolls are down by 1.8 million from the day I took office, and child support collections are up by 40 percent, $3 billion. The crime rate has dropped in each of the last 4 years, as we are about the business of putting 100,000 more police on the street, attacking violence against women and children, working for safe and drug-free schools. And yes, we passed the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban. But contrary to all the hysteria that was whipped up in 1994 against the people who voted for the crime bill, not a single Arizona hunter or sports person, not a single Arkansas hunter or sports person lost their weapon. But 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers did lose the right to get a handgun because we passed the Brady bill, and we're better off because of it."", ""The Government we have today in Washington is very different from the Government we had 4 years ago. It is, first of all, smaller by 250,000. The Government is now the smallest it's been since John Kennedy was the President of the United States in the early sixties. And I might say, to give you a better impression of how much we've shrunk the Government, it's a bigger country now than it was in 1960, more people live here. As a percentage of the civilian work force, the Federal Government is today the smallest it's been since Franklin Roosevelt took the oath of office for the first time in 1933."", ""We have reduced the size and burden of the Federal Government, but we still have a Government that is strong enough to help us meet our challenges and protect our values. The role of the Government today is to create the conditions and give people the tools to make the most of their own lives, and that's what we are attempting to do."", ""And finally, let me say, we have plainly maintained our responsibility to be a force for peace and freedom and prosperity, with 200 new trade agreements, 21 with Japan alone—American exports up 85 percent in the areas covered by our trade agreements with Japan; the United States number one again in automobile production and sales around the world for the first time since the 1970's; working for peace in the Middle East, in Northern Ireland, in Haiti, throughout the world; reducing the nuclear threat—for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age in the last 4 years, there's not a single nuclear missile pointed at the children of America. And you can be proud of that."", 'Just a couple of days ago I had the great honor of supporting and then being able to announce that the United Nations voted overwhelmingly to ban nuclear testing forever, a huge event. And now the United States Senate is considering something called the Chemical Weapons Convention, and if we pass it—160 nations have signed it, 60 have ratified it, we need to follow suit and ratify it in the Senate because it will enable us to reduce the availability of chemical weapons for terrorists, for countries that would promote chemical weapons and use them in an inhumane way. Nobody is immune from this. You saw from the terrorist attack in the Tokyo subway what can happen when innocent people are subject to this.', 'So I implore the Senate to go on and ratify this. This is a bipartisan thing. This treaty was negotiated when President Bush was in office, but it has never been ratified. And we must ratify it so we can continue the work of making the world a safer place, especially from terrorists.', 'And finally let me say on that subject, as all of you know, in recent days it became necessary for me to order our pilots to take certain actions in Iraq, to increase the chances that we could prevent Saddam Hussein from threatening his neighbors because of what he was doing to his own people. I just want to say, again, that we are going to do everything we can to make sure our own pilots are safe, that they can fly their missions in safety. We will do whatever is necessary to protect them. And the determination of the United States in dealing with the problem of Iraq should not be underestimated. We will do what we must do to protect our people and our soldiers.', ""Now, you heard Rose Mofford say that I called her back in 1988. When I was a Governor I was often appalled by what I saw coming out of Washington, frankly, because it seemed to me that the further you got away from the people and the closer you got to Washington, DC, the more our politics became about rhetoric and the less about reality. There was more name-calling and less working in ways that would change people's lives."", 'The things that I have just said to you, it seems to me, document beyond question that we are capable of working together in a partnership that will have a positive impact on the lives of the people of the United States.', ""So let me say again, I have tried to change the politics of your Capital from who's to blame to what are we going to do? And even though we have come a long way in the last 4 years, I think we all know we still have a lot of challenges to meet to make sure when we start that new century and a new millennium, our country is the kind of country we want it to be. We do have to build a bridge to the 21st century, but we've got to build it on ideas, not insults. And this campaign ought to be a campaign of ideas about what is best for the American people."", ""Now, let me say very briefly where I think we should go and the bridge that I hope you will help me build. First of all, if we're going to build a bridge to the 21st century of opportunity, we have to make sure that every American who is willing to work has a chance to participate in that opportunity. In a world dominated increasingly by high technology, by rapid movement of information, by global competition, education is more important to the well-being not only of individual Americans, but to our country than ever before in the history of the United States."", 'In the past 4 years I worked on a broad front to improve education, from increasing Head Start to giving our schools funds to raise their standards, stay open after school for kids who are in trouble, try innovative reform measures that would enable them to achieve higher levels of learning. We reformed the student loan program to make the loans lower cost and to have better repayment terms so more people could go. And we fought back what I considered to be very ill-advised efforts to cut back on education funding at a time when education is more important to our future than ever before.', 'Now, what are we going to do in the future? I think, first of all, we should have a clear agenda that includes at a minimum the following items: Number one, 40 percent of the 8-yearolds in this country still can\'t read a book on their own. Even though improvement in math and science is going up, even though our schools are plainly getting better, 40 percent of those kids can\'t. I propose to put together an army of 30,000 mentors from national service volunteers, from young people on work-study in college, from trained reading tutors, to mobilize a million true volunteers to go into every high school in this country—I mean—excuse me— every grade school in this country where it is needed to make sure by the year 2000 every 8-year-old in America can pick up a book and say, ""I read this myself.""', ""Second, we have an opportunity that is truly revolutionary because of technology to do something never before done. We are working hard not only to get computers and educational materials and software to go into computers in all the classrooms of America, we've also worked to train teachers who can at least keep up with all these young kids who are computer wizards, something I can't do."", 'This summer, the National Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers, the school principals, and other education groups put together 100,000 teachers who began the work of training 500,000 more teachers to make sure that the teachers could actually use the computers in the classroom to teach the students. And now it is time to make sure that we do the last thing. We need to make sure that every classroom and every library and every school in America is hooked up to the information superhighway, to the Internet, to the World Wide Web, to all these networks of information.', 'Now, let me just say for a moment what the significance of that is. What this means is that for the first time ever in the history of the country, if we do it, children in the smallest, most isolated rural school districts in America, children in the poorest inner-city school districts in America, no matter where these children are, they will have access to the same information in the same form in the same time at the same level of quality as children in the wealthiest school districts in the country. It has never happened before. We can do it in the next 4 years, and we should—and we should.', 'Finally, in the next 4 years we should truly open the doors of college education to anyone of any age who needs to go—of any age. And I propose to do the following:', 'Number one, we ought to set as a national goal in 4 years, we\'ll make at least a community college degree as universal in America as a high school diploma is today. How? Almost every American is within driving distance of a community college, and those places work. They\'re open; they\'re flexible; they\'re results-oriented; they\'re democratic—small ""d,"" that is they\'re open to everybody. They work the way America ought to work more. And all we have to do to make community college available to everybody is to say to people, ""If you\'ll go, we\'ll give you a tax credit of up to $1,500 a year for the tuition,"" which would cover the typical tuition cost throughout the country.', 'Second, we should give a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year for the cost of any education after high school so we can encourage people to go forward, encourage parents and grandparents to help their children and grandchildren go to college.', ""The third thing I want to so do is to recognize that a lot of adults need more education as well, and that we have 70—70 at least—different programs in the Federal Government that have developed for the best of reasons over time. But you need a slide rule to figure out whether you qualify for them. And what I want to do is to say to someone, if you qualify for Federal educational help because you have lost your job or because you are grossly underemployed, instead of these 70 different programs you have to figure out, I want to put all that money in one pot and give a skills grant worth up to $2,500 a year to people and say, take it to your local community college, take it wherever it's best for you. But here it is, go get an education so you can go up not down on the job scale if you lose your job. Will you help me build that kind of bridge to the 21st century? [Applause] I need your help."", 'I think we should promote more homeownership. Our Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry Cisneros has worked hard, and we have cut the average closing costs for firsttime homebuyers by nearly a $1,000. We have a 15-year-high in homeownership. But I want this to be within reach of every American. We have lots of initiatives to do that. But one of the things that I think we should do is to change the law so that people simply do not have to pay taxes when they sell their home even if it appreciates in value up to a half a million dollars. I think we should do that.', ""And finally, let me say, if we want to have opportunity, we've got to keep this economy going. And that means that we have to continue to finish the work to balance the budget, but we have to do it in the right way. And I want to talk a little about that. There's been a huge debate about that, you know, in the last 2 years since our friends in the other party won the Congress. And you can see from outside that they're a little sensitive about the fact that America didn't like their budget. [Laughter]"", 'But let\'s talk about it. We do have to balance the budget. Why? Well, one thing that our Republican friends said last year that I agree with is—they said last year—not this year, but last year—they said, ""If we\'re not on a path to balancing the budget, interest rates will be 2 percent higher."" I agree with that. Now what does that mean? That means—you just figure it out for yourselves—that means 2 percent on your car payment, your credit card payment, your home payment. Even more important for the overall health of the economy, it means 2 percent on those loans that business people need to take out to start those new businesses or to expand the businesses. And keep in mind, we\'ve had 4 years in a row of record formation of small business. But that\'s where most of the new jobs are coming from.', ""So we do need to go on and balance the budget. So the question is how. And that's what we're revisiting in this election. The budget I vetoed that the Congress passed, I vetoed not because I didn't want to balance the budget but because I thought it was wrong to basically end Medicaid's 30-year guarantee of health care to poor women and little babies; to end the 30-year guarantee of health coverage to middle class families who had members with disabilities where they were struggling to take care of those people in their own homes and go to work every day; wrong to end the guarantee of those who had very limited incomes and needed that help if they had to be in nursing homes."", ""I thought it was wrong to create a two-tier Medicare system which said to people, if you're unfortunate enough to be older, poorer, and sicker than most other seniors, you could well get second-class care. I thought it was wrong not to keep up with inflation and population growth in Medicare and instead to have real cuts that were going to force people to make payments out of pocket, designed to fund a budget system that had an enormous tax cut that went to people like me, and I didn't need it. I thought that was wrong. I don't apologize for that. I still think it was wrong. I still think it was wrong."", 'I thought it was wrong—I thought it was wrong for us to be cutting the safe and drugfree schools law, to be abolishing AmeriCorps, to be turning our back on our commitment to put 100,000 police on the street, to pass a budget that would have raised taxes on 9 million of our poorest working people, actually raise taxes on them. I thought it was wrong to allow a raid on the pension funds in America of nearly $15 billion. We went through that pension collapse just a few years ago. Are we going to go back and make that mistake all over again? I thought that was wrong.', ""So I plead guilty. I vetoed it, and I'd do so again because I thought it was wrong. But that does not mean—again, that does not mean that we should not balance the budget. It does not mean that we don't have to have some savings in Medicare to stabilize the program so it's going to be there not just next year but 10 years from now, 15 years from now, 20 years from now for all who need it. But the changes should be made by someone who believes in Medicare and believes it's served our country well, not someone who doesn't care whether it exists or not. Now, that should be done."", ""But we have to keep doing the work of balancing the budget. But you know, if we turn around and walk away from our obligations to invest in environmental protection and new technology and education, we'll hurt ourselves. Let me give you one other example. Arizona has become a center for precision manufacturing because of the dry air and because of the good climate for manufacturing and for working. You have a huge stake here in this State in seeing that we continue on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology, high technology."", 'Whether you do anything that has anything to do with that or not, everyone who lives in Arizona has a big stake in seeing that America maintains its technological lead. That means that we have to do some public investment in research and elemental development. We must do that.', ""In biomedical research, Government-funded research has led to unprecedented gains in many areas in the last 4 years. Public research has led to a lot of things that we now take for granted; the Internet—the Internet is the product of a Federal research project. But as soon as it was obvious that it was going to work, the Government did exactly what the Government should do. We couldn't run it. We got out of it and let the private sector take over."", 'Right now we are engaged in a joint venture with IBM to develop a supercomputer that will do more calculations in one second than you could go home and pick up a pocket—a handheld calculator and do by yourself—listen to this—in 30,000 years.', ""Now, we have to make those kinds of investments because the private sector can't afford to do it, it's too problematical. You have to break through these barriers, but this will make a huge difference in the future of our country."", 'So I say to you, go out and tell your fellow Arizonans, whether they\'re Republicans, Democrats, independents, you name it, ""Yes, balance the budget, but do it in a way that brings us together instead of drives us apart. Do it in a way that honors our obligations. And do it in a way that builds that bridge to the 21st century."" That\'s what we have to do.', ""Folks, let me just make a couple of other points more briefly. We have to build a bridge to the 21st century that honors responsibility. And I just mentioned two points there. I just signed a welfare reform bill that was fairly controversial, and I didn't think it was perfect. But I did it because I think it is imperative to end the isolation of those people who are trapped on welfare generation after generation. I think it is imperative to bring people into the world of work, to bring those families into contact with other families, to make them believe that they can change their lives."", ""And now the challenge is to take this new system and make it work. The new system says, if you're poor, we will still give you health care for your children, we will still give you nutrition, and now we will give you more in child care if you go to work. But now the income check will go to the State, and they must find a way to move able-bodied people from welfare to work within 2 years."", 'My challenge is to every Governor in this country and every private business person: now we have to create the jobs, a million more jobs at least, in the next 4 years for people who have been trapped on welfare. We have reduced the welfare rolls by 1.8 million. If we can do a million more with the hardest-to-place cases, you will see that we can end welfare as we know it and bring people back into mainstream America and make poverty a temporary, not a permanent, condition for a whole generation of young people. We have to do that and I want you to help me do that.', ""The second thing I want to talk about briefly is the crime problem. Crime is still a big problem in America. Yes, the crime rate in the country has dropped for 4 years. Yes, in most major cities it's going down. But it's still going up in some suburbs and small towns. It's still a problem. And it will be a problem until you can go home at night and turn on the evening news and the first story is not a crime story. Or if it is a crime story, you're absolutely shocked, instead of saying, what else is new. That's how you will know. We'll always have some crime. You'll know when we've got this thing whipped when you're shocked when you see a crime story leading the evening news at night instead of saying, what else is new."", ""Now, instead of 4 years of a declining crime rate, we need 8 years of a declining crime rate. That's what we have to do. We have to finish putting those police on the street. We ought to take the cop-killer bullets off the street; they have no hunting or sporting purpose. We ought to extend the Brady bill. The Brady bill has worked well. It now applies to any felons. I think the Brady bill ought to apply to anyone who abuses a child or a spouse in the home, as well. We should try to reduce that."", ""The last thing we have to do is build a bridge to the 21st century that strengthens our American community. And I want to mention some things real quickly. The problem I hear young people talk most about, and even people that aren't so young, who may still have children in the home, is that they are constantly finding examples where they feel torn between their obligations to spend time with their children and do things with their children, and their obligations at work. That's why I fought for the family and medical leave law. I didn't want to interrupt the free enterprise system, but it seemed to me that if you had people all torn up and upset at work because their kids were in trouble at home and they couldn't take care of them, that wasn't going to be very good for the economy."", ""It also seems to me that if we make Americans make a choice between succeeding at work and succeeding at home, we are defeated before we start. Whichever choice they have to make— whichever choice they have to make, we lose, because most parents are working and most parents have to work. Whether it's a single-parent household or two parents in the household, it's not as if it's an option for most people."", ""So if we want to come together as a community, we have to begin with the building block of our community, the family. That's why I thought family and medical leave was important. That's why I thought more Head Start and more immunizations for kids was important. That's why I thought it was important to try to protect children against the dangers of marketing and selling tobacco, which is illegal in every State in the country, but it happens everywhere. That's why we fought for the V-chip and the television rating system, so parents could have some control over the programming their young children see. If it's inappropriate, they'd have some control over that. Because I think we have to struggle to help people succeed at work and at home. And that will be a continuing challenge for us."", ""I'd like to see a very limited amendment in the family leave law which says you can also have a little time off without losing your job to take your children or your parents to regular doctor's appointments, and to go to parentteacher conferences at school. I think that would be a good thing. It would be very limited. I might say to you that there has been a study on the family leave law in which almost all the businesses in the country say that it hasn't cost them any money to comply with. And it obviously hasn't hurt the economy, since we're growing like crazy. So I think we ought to do that."", ""The second thing I'd like to say is, we can't preserve our sense of community unless we're committed to growing the economy while preserving our natural environment. I am very proud of the things we've done to make drinking water and food safer, to set aside more national parks, to make the air cleaner, to expand community right-to-know. This is going to be a challenge that every one of us has to face. But let me just point out, there are still 10 million children in this country—10 million children living within 4 miles of a toxic waste dump. And that's in spite of the fact that we closed down more in 3 years than were closed down in the 12 years before I came here to Washington."", ""I propose to close 500 more, two-thirds of them, the two-thirds worst, in the next 4 years so I can go to a crowd like this, and I can look in the eyes of these children, and I can say, the children of this country should grow up next to parks, not poison. And I want you to help me do that. It's very, very important."", ""The last point I want to make is this: This country has come a long way in its relationships with each other across racial and ethnic lines and religious lines since I was a boy. But we're having even more challenges. You know, when I had the honor of representing you at the Olympics it was thrilling to me to see teams there from 197 different nations. And when I was watching all the teams go in carrying their flags, it all of the sudden struck me that the biggest county in America, Los Angeles County, has people in one county in America from 150 of those 197 places. That's a stunning insight."", ""Then I looked at the American Olympic team, and it struck me that if they didn't have American jackets on, they wouldn't have a clue which country they were from. These are from the Middle East. And those are from Asia somewhere. And those folks are from Latin America."", 'And these are from the Caribbean. And those are from Africa. And well, those folks are from Scandinavia. I mean, you get the picture.', ""And really, if you look at the Olympics, I think one reason we like it is we think that we ought to live that way all the time. Everybody agrees to the rules. Most people don't win medals, but even the ones that don't win are better off, because they try in an honorable way and they do their very best. Nobody disqualifies you because of what your religious faith is or what your race or your ethnic group is. You can't get ahead—you can't break in your opponent's room the night before and break his legs and get a medal for it. [Laughter] Nobody admires you if you stand up behind a microphone and tell everybody how terrible the person you're racing against is. We sort of like the way the Olympics work. We think the world ought to work that way."", ""And so that's the last thing I leave you with. We have to stand—when you see these church burnings or these synagogues being defaced or these Islamic centers being burned, you have to stand against that."", ""Remember how much of your time as President—because all my time belongs to you— you think about how much time, your time, I've had to spend dealing with places where people insisted on killing each other because of their religious, their racial, their ethnic, or their tribal differences. You just think about it: Rwanda, Burundi, the Middle East, Haiti, you name it. Any of these countries. We're trying to hold elections in Bosnia where they lived in peace for decades, where there is biologically no difference between the Muslims, the Croats, and the Serbs. They belonged to different religious groups because of historical developments, and they started killing each other in the flash of an eye, and did it with abandon for 4 years."", ""And so when we see the slightest evidence of that in this country we have to say, no, no, no, no, no. America is a place where, if you believe in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence, and you're willing to show up tomorrow, you're our kind of person and we're going to walk across that bridge to the 21st century with you, too."", 'Thank you, and God bless you.']"
66,William J. Clinton ,"September 11, 1996","[""Thank you very much. Good morning. It's great to be back in Pueblo again. I want to say first, Dr. Martinez, thank you for welcoming us here to the courthouse. And all of you who live here must be so proud of this magnificent building. I love it. I think we should give Josh Rael another hand for doing such a good job on the national anthem. [Applause]"", ""I want to thank all of those who spoke before me, Mike Beatty, Al Gurule, Lieutenant Governor Gail Schoettler, and Tom Strickland. I hope you will send Tom Strickland to the United States Senate. I have a lot of confidence in him, and as I'll say in a moment, when these people present themselves for Congress and the Senate, there are real consequences to your lives."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, I'm glad to be back here today because this is an election season, but elections should not be divorced from our lives. The choices we make as citizens for those who represent us affect the way we live after the elections are over."", ""As I was sitting here looking at Mayor Webb making his remarks, and my longtime friend and former colleague, Governor Romer making his remarks, and I couldn't help thinking how lucky Colorado is to be served by public officials like this who can make a positive difference in people's lives."", ""I also have to tell that I was talking with Patricia Heine before she got up here to speak; she told me that she had become a police officer 7 years ago, after working on raising her sons. And I thought to myself, it's a pretty great country when a mother who loves her children and cares for other people's children has the willingness, the ability, and is given the opportunity to go back to work in public safety to make this community and this State and our country a better place. And we thank you."", ""Today I want to talk, as Governor Romer said and Mayor Webb said, about the issue of crime, about the link between crime and drugs, and about what we have to do to make our streets safer if we're going to realize our vision for the 21st century. As your President, I have worked hard on a simple, straightforward vision for the next century, and especially for the children in this audience. We're only 4 years away from a brand new century and a brand new millennium. We're undergoing enormous changes, as all of you know, in the way we work and live and relate to each other and the rest of the world."", ""I want us to go into that next century as the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity. I want us to go into that century with all the American people in our mosaic from all different ethnic groups, all different walks of life, growing together and being stronger together in a close-knit community that help each other to make the most of their own lives. And I want to make sure the American dream is alive and well for every single man or woman, boy or girl, who is willing to work for it. And that is my vision: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and everybody has a place in our American community. I hope you'll help me to realize that."", ""We've worked very hard in the last 4 years to create economic opportunity, and this country is better off than it was 4 years ago. We have the lowest unemployment rate in 7 1/2 years; 10 1/2 million new jobs. We have 4 1/2 million new homeowners. The deficit has gone down for 4 years in a row for the first time since the 1840's, before the Civil War. Wages are rising again for average working people for the first time in a decade. There are 1.8 million fewer people on welfare today than there were the day I took the oath of office."", 'Child support collections are up 40 percent; 40 million people have had their pensions protected; 12 million Americans have taken some time off in the family leave law, keeping their jobs while their babies were born or they had a sick parent they needed to take care of. The air is cleaner for 50 million Americans, and we have cleaned up more toxic waste dumps in 3 years than were cleaned up in the 12 years previous. We are moving in the right direction.', ""On October 1st, 10 million hard-working Americans will get a pay raise when the minimum wage law goes into effect. And that's a good thing for America."", ""Twenty-five million Americans will be helped by the Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform bill which says you can't lose your health insurance anymore just because someone in your family gets sick or you have to change jobs. This country is on the right track for the 21st century."", ""I have worked hard to make these things possible by working with all people of good will who were willing to move our country forward, to change the politics of Washington from who's to blame to what are we going to do about it, and what can we do together?"", 'I have asked the American people to join with me in building a bridge to the 21st century, a bridge that we can all walk across together, a bridge that will be strong enough to realize our dreams for the future, to give every child the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. And I want you to help me build that bridge. Will you do that? [Applause]', ""We have to make educational opportunity available for all. That means we have to create the most excellent system of education in the world for all of our children without regard to their racial or ethnic background or whether they're poor, rich, or middle class, whether they live in poor, rural communities or big cities or some place in between. I have a plan to make sure that every 8-year-old child in America will be able to read on his or her own by the year 2000. And we need to do that."", 'If we keep to our commitment to make sure that every classroom and library and every school in the United States is hooked up to the information superhighway by the year 2000, every child for the first time in the history of this country—every child—will have access to the same information at the same level of quality in the same time as every other child, rich, poor, or middle class. That will revolutionize education. And we have to do that.', 'And finally, let me say, in this great community which has, among other things, a perfectly wonderful community college where I was the last time I came here—I want to ask you to help me make sure that in the next 4 years we make 2 years of education after high school, the equivalent of a community college degree, just as universal in America as a high school diploma is today by giving people a tax credit for the tuition there.', 'By giving people a tax credit for the tuition cost of a typical community college, by giving our American people a $10,000 tax deduction per year for any tuition cost at any institution of higher education—undergraduate, graduate, community college, you name it—by letting the American people and letting more Americans take out more savings in an IRA, save that money, and then withdraw it tax-free to pay for college education, health care, or to buy a first-time home, that will build a bridge to the 21st century.', 'To build that bridge, we have to keep this economy growing steady and strong until every American has a chance to benefit from it. That means we have to balance the budget. But we have to do it in the right way. We must balance the budget to keep the interest rates coming down so that you can afford house payments, car payments, credit card payments. So that small-business people can afford to borrow money to build their businesses, we have made every small business in America eligible for a tax cut if they invest more money in their business. We are growing small businesses at a record rate, but we have to continue to balance the budget. But we can do it. And we must do it without wrecking Medicare, Medicaid, cutting back on our investments in education and protecting our environment. We have to do that.', ""We have to build a bridge to the 21st century where families can succeed at home and at work. Most parents—whether the family is a one-parent or a two-parent household—most parents are working today, and most parents have to work. I hardly ever meet a family that doesn't tell me there has been some time in their lives when they've really faced a dilemma in the conflict between their obligations at work and their obligations at home."", ""That's why we worked hard to pass the family leave law. That's why we worked hard to increase childhood immunizations, to increase Head Start, to pass the V-chip law to give parents the ability to control inappropriate programming and its access through television to the young children. That's why we've worked hard to protect our young people from the dangers of marketing and selling tobacco which is illegal in every State but prevalent in every State. And that's why I believe we should expand the family and medical leave law to say in a very limited way, people also ought to be able to take their children to doctor's appointments and to the local parent-teacher conference without losing their jobs in this country. And I hope you'll help me do that."", ""We have a lot of environment work to do to build our bridge to the 21st century. There are still 10 million American children—listen to this—10 million American children living within 4 miles of a toxic waste dump. I want to clean up two-thirds of those dumps, the worst ones, in just the next 4 years, by far the most rapid pace in history. But it's important to us. Our children should be growing up next to parks, not poison. And I want you to help me build that bridge to the 21st century."", 'But let me tell you, we cannot—we cannot— build the right bridge to the 21st century unless our children and their families are safe in their homes, on their streets, in their schools, in their communities. Four years ago, I came to this wonderful community just 2 weeks before election day. I said I wanted to prove, and I quote— this is what I said then, that ""you could be tough on crime and smart at the same time."" Well, 4 years later, I can tell you that that approach is possible, and it\'s working.', 'Just 2 years ago this Friday, in one of the proudest moments of my Presidency, I signed the 1994 crime bill. We began to put 100,000 police on our streets. We\'re about halfway home now. We have about 500 already funded in Colorado, five right here in Pueblo. We made ""three strikes and you\'re out"" the law of the land. We began helping States to build 100,000 new prison cells. We began to expand prevention programs so our young people would have something to say yes to, not just no.', 'And let me say, not a single sportsman or hunter in Colorado—notwithstanding what they were told in 1994—has lost their hunting or sporting weapon—not a single, solitary one, not one. But you know what? Sixty thousand felons, fugitives, and stalkers could not get a handgun because of the Brady bill. It was the right thing to do. We are safer because of it.', 'Now, this strategy is working. For 4 years in a row, the crime rate has come down. But no matter how tough our penalties, no matter how many new prisons we build, we will never break this problem until we break the cycle of crime and drugs and stop the revolving door between prisons and drug use on the streets.', 'Let me be clear, the best antidrug program is still parents teaching their children right from wrong. It\'s still those D.A.R.E. officers in the schools standing up there in front of those classes and letting those little children with their wide eyes look at people in uniforms and say, ""That\'s the kind of person I want to be, and that\'s the kind of behavior I want to have.""', ""That's why I fought for the safe and drugfree schools program, which puts antidrug counselors like Officer Heine in the classroom. The first bill I vetoed as President, the very first one, was a bill passed by this Congress that would have gutted the safe and drug-free schools program. I don't know about you, but I think we need more people like her, not fewer, in front of our children in the schools of America."", ""Last year Congress gave me about $700 million less than I sought to fight drugs, and that's wrong, and I hope we can correct it before they go home. I appointed a four-star general, an American military hero, General Barry McCaffrey, to lead our attack on drugs, and he has developed a strategy for us that we will follow with great discipline over the next 5 years, targeted at keeping drugs away from our children and he deserves the support that he needs."", 'Illegal drugs are a significant force behind the vast majority of violent crimes in this country and a big part of the problem with juvenile crime. Drug dealers with guns, criminals on drugs, they contribute a lot to the misery that the rest of America has to endure.', ""Listen to this: Two-thirds of the men in State prisons have substance abuse problems. I have signed an Executive order to require drug testing of anyone brought into the Federal system, but I have not been able to affect that. Listen to this. When criminals on parole go back on drugs, the chances are enormously high they will commit new crimes. Sixty percent—listen— 60 percent of all the heroin and cocaine sold in the entire United States goes to people on bail, on probation, or on parole. Seventy-five percent of the prisoners with a history of heroin or cocaine use who are released without treatment go back to drugs within 3 months and return to crime. We have to stop this cycle, or we'll never get on top of the problem."", ""In spite of this problem, States often don't do much to test parolees or prisoners, or provide adequate treatment. That has to be changed. Drugs don't belong in prisons or in the hands of parolees. Parole is not a license to break the law, use drugs, and slip back into crime; it is a chance to go straight and live a better life."", ""So today I propose to offer legislation that will say to every State in the country, we are prepared to continue to use funds from our crime bill to help you build your prisons. But if you want that money, you now must start drug testing prisoners and parolees to break the cycle of crime and drugs. It's time to say to inmates, if you stay on drugs, you'll stay in jail; if you want our of jail, you have to get off drugs. It's time to say to parolees, if you go back on drugs, you'll go back to jail; if you want to stay on the street, stay off drugs. And I want you to help me send that message to America."", 'We know the States are hard-pressed, and we intend to do our part. Today the Department of Justice announced $27 million in grants to States for testing and intervention with prisoners, to help them break this cycle. States can start using this money right now for drug testing and for intervention to help prisoners and parolees.', ""And let me tell you something, folks, this is not an election year pledge. This will work. A new report shows that in Delaware, prisoners who got treatment in prison and during work release were 75 percent drug-free and 70 percent arrest-free after 18 months; but 80 percent of the prisoners who did not receive treatment went back on drugs, and two out of three were arrested again. It is simple. We know what to do, now let's go do it. Let's build a bridge to the 21st century that breaks the cycle of crime and drugs."", 'I want to say to all of you, I am more optimistic than I was when I came here 4 years ago about our future. I am more idealistic about the possibilities of Americans to do good things together. But we must make a commitment to work together, to create opportunity for all, to get responsibility from all of our citizens, and to reach out to one another across the lines that divide us so that we can go forward together. That is the bridge that I seek to build to the 21st century, and I hope you will help to build it.', 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"
67,William J. Clinton ,"September 12, 1996","['Thank you. Wow! Thank you so much. Thank you for being here. Thank you for your wonderful signs. Thank you for making me feel so welcome. Thank you, Dot Powell. Thank you, Cal Dooley, for being a great Congressman and a truly extraordinary human being. You\'re very lucky to be represented by Cal Dooley in the United States Congress. Thank you, Debbie Manning, for devoting your life to teaching. Thank you, Shianne Lenhof, for being such a good representative of the young people of today and the future of America. You both made me very proud, and I can\'t wait to tell Hillary that you did say, ""It takes a village."" Thank you.', 'I know there are a lot of schools here today and a lot of students represented, not only here from Dailey but also from Fresno High, from Waona, Tenaya Middle School, Powers-Ginsburg, Edison Computech, Edison High, Muir, and Holland. Thank you all for being here. I want to thank the people who provided our music: the McLean High School Highlanders, the Hoover High School Marching Band, the Roosevelt High School Mariachi, the McLean High School Marching Band, the Raisin Babies Jazz Band. Thank you all very much. Thank you.', 'I am delighted to be back in the Valley. I did not know until Cal Dooley told me on my way over here this morning—Cal and I were in the car, and he said, ""Do you realize that no President has ever come to the Valley twice in one term?"" And I said, ""I have a hard time believing that. What were they thinking about? I\'ve had a good time here, and I\'m glad to be here.""', ""Your Valley contributes so much to America, especially in the power of its agricultural production, and it's been a great honor to me to work to open markets for the products produced here all around the world. And I'm proud that American exports and American farm exports are now at an all-time high, thanks to the efforts of the farmers right here in this fine Valley."", ""I understand we are also joined here today by some members of our Olympic champion softball team, all from Fresno State: assistant coach Margie Wright, Julie Smith, Laura Berg, Shelly Stokes, Kim Maher, Martha Noffsinger-O'Kelley. They're all here. Thank you very much for being here."", ""Ladies and gentlemen and boys and girls, I want to talk to you today about what you're doing here and what we have to do as a nation to give our children the best education in the world. Just this month, as you can see from the extra buildings around here, the largest group of children in the history of America began school, the largest group of children ever, the first class of American children to be bigger than the biggest of the so-called baby-boom classes."", 'The education that you receive today will determine the kind of country we live in and the kind of people we are tomorrow. We must say to ourselves, to our children, and for our future, we will expect and receive the highest standards from our students, our teachers, our schools, and all of us who have a responsibility to lift them up and support them.', 'You know, our country has had an interesting 4 years. I have pursued a straightforward strategy, that I believe in very much, to help all of you go into the 21st century with every person, every person that was talked about in the introduction, without regard to their race, their religion, their ethnic group, their background, where they start in life, every person having a chance to live out their dreams and live up to their God-given potential. The strategy is: opportunity for everyone, responsibility from everyone, and an American community where everyone—everyone—has a place, plays a role, and we all grow stronger together. And I believe that is the key to realizing our dreams in the 21st century.', 'If you look at where we are today, compared to where we were 4 years ago, this strategy is showing some results. We have the lowest unemployment rates in 7 1/2 years; we have 10 1/2 million new jobs; we have almost 4 1/2 million new homeowners. We have a record number of new small businesses starting in our country in every year, record exports, the deficit has been cut in all 4 years for the first time since before the Civil War. We are moving in the right direction.', 'There are 1.8 million fewer people on welfare; child support collections are up 40 percent. In October, 10 million hard-working Americans will get an increase in their minimum wage, and all small-business people will get tax cuts when they invest more in their businesses or when they buy health insurance. And it will be easier for them to take out retirement plans for themselves and their employees and for people to keep their retirement when they move from job to job.', 'Twelve million Americans have taken advantage of the family leave law, when a baby was born or a parent was sick, to keep their job, not lose it, and take care of their families. This country is moving in the right direction.', ""The Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform bill made 25 million Americans eligible to get or keep their health insurance by saying you cannot be denied health insurance because somebody in your family has been sick or because you have to change jobs. That is a major step forward to strengthen the security of America's families."", ""And as we go forward, particularly in this election season, I ask you to remember that what works in our political system is not asking, who is to blame? What works is asking, what are we going to do together to make things better? And let's ask those questions and make this a season of ideas, not insults. We can lift the American people up. We can learn things from each other, and we can move this country forward."", 'Yes, we should build a bridge to the 21st century big enough and strong enough for every single one of the children in California and the children in the United States to walk across, and I want you, each and every one of you, to help to build that bridge. Will you do that? [Applause]', 'We should build a bridge with a growing economy, with a balanced budget that keeps interest rates down but does not harm Medicare and Medicaid, our commitment to education, to research, to preserving our environment. We should build a bridge where all Americans take responsibility.', ""The crime rate has gone down for 4 years now. We've got to keep it going down for 4 more years, and I want you to help me do that. Let's support our police on the street. Let's support the D.A.R.E. officers in the schools, preaching safe and drug-free schools. I appointed a four-star general, General Barry McCaffrey, to lead our fight against drugs. His last post in the military required him to do everything he could to stop drugs from coming into our country as the commander of all of our forces south of our border. Today he's in Los Angeles, carrying on that fight. But that's everyone's fight, and everyone has to take responsibility for waging it."", 'We should build a bridge to the 21st century where people can succeed at home and at work. We dare not ask our people to sacrifice their responsibilities as parents to succeed in the workplace, and we cannot expect people to have to fail in the workplace just to be good parents. We have to find a way to do both, and we have to build that bridge to the 21st century.', ""We have to build a bridge to the 21st century with a clean environment. Two-thirds—twothirds—of our toxic waste sites can be cleaned up in the next 4 years, all of the worst ones. Let me tell you why that's important. We cleaned up more toxic waste dumps in 3 years than were cleaned up in the 12 years before I became President. But there are still—listen to this—there are still 10 million American children living within just 4 miles of a toxic waste dump. That is wrong. Our kids should be growing up next to parks, not poison, and we need to build that bridge to the 21st century."", 'But nothing is more important to building that bridge to a brighter future than what is being done here at Morris Dailey, communities creating a good education, young people taking responsibility for making the most of their potential. There are so many people here who deserve our praise and our thanks throughout this community with your community-wide literacy program, all of the things that are being done here.', ""And let me say that I appreciate what Cal Dooley said. I don't know if you can say that we've made more efforts to help our schools and our children than ever before in history, but I hope it's true. I'll say this: If we do it for 4 more years, it will be true. We have expanded Head Start, we've expanded the availability of college loans with the Goals 2000 program. We've given schools the flexibility to pursue national standards of excellence with local grassroots reforms. We have done a lot to help schools in California and other places try new experiments, allowing teachers to form even new schools, called charter schools. There are over 300 in the country, 90 of them right here in California, and our administration has helped to start them. Our next budget calls for 3,000 more. I believe we should let 1,000 flowers bloom, whatever it takes to bring the families, the parents, the community leaders in to support the teachers and the principals and the educators, so that together we can have the kind of village that it takes to make sure our children have excellence in education."", ""We should have higher standards. Every diploma should mean something. Standardized tests don't always work, but we can develop those which we give and which are passed as people are promoted, so that you know that when you get a diploma it means something."", 'And I\'d like to talk about just three other things that I think we ought to do. I am so impressed by the work being done here in literacy and by the work being done in this school. But you should know that in our country as a whole—partly because we have so many young people whose first language is not English— 40 percent of our third graders still cannot read a book on their own. One of the things that we ought to commit ourselves to as a country is to say by the year 2000, every 8-year-old in America will be able to pick up an appropriate book and say, ""I read this all by myself.""', 'I have proposed sending 30,000 literacy tutors, AmeriCorps volunteers, young college students on work-study, and others to mobilize a million citizen volunteers to show up at any school that needs them and say, ""What can we do? We\'re there; we\'re trained; we\'ll help."" We want our children to be able to read, every single one of them, so they can make the most of the rest of their education.', ""Second thing we ought to do is to make sure that every classroom in America, like Debbie Manning's class today, is connected not just with computers and software but connected to the information superhighway, to the vast network of information that opens the whole world up potentially to every student in every classroom."", ""Last March the Vice President and I joined other Californians on NetDay, connecting 4,000 schools in one day. On October 12th, Californians again will come together to connect more schools. If in 4 years we can connect every classroom and every library in America to the information superhighway with adequate computers, good educational software, and trained teachers, for the first time in the entire history of the United States, every child—from the poorest inner-city school to the most remote mountain rural district to the wealthiest schools in America—every child for the first time will have access to the same information in the same way in the same time at the same quality. It will revolutionize educational opportunity in America. That's a bridge we have to build to the 21st century."", ""We have to do a better job of preparing and supporting our teachers. For the past 2 years, the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future—chaired by my friend, the Governor of North Carolina, Jim Hunt—studied the state of teaching in America. The Secretary of Education, Dick Riley, today is announcing their findings in Washington. The report makes it clear that we should have high standards for teachers, but that too often teachers are not rewarded when they do a good job. If the treatment is the same, if the support is the same whether people are succeeding or not, we don't have the right incentives."", ""We have to make sure that teachers are properly prepared, that they're supported throughout their teaching careers, that they can count on community support they need. We have to recruit and retain good people. We have to require the right high licensing and certification standards. We ought to find ways to identify and reward good teachers; we should be lifting our teachers up, not bashing them and finding ways just to be critical. When people should not be in the classroom, the removal should occur fairly but quickly, with less expense than it does today."", 'But the main thing is, if we had a system that supported all teachers—not just in the best schools with the best principals, not just in the best school districts with the best system—if every community had parents and teachers and principals and community leaders working together and every community said, ""High standards yes, but people can meet these high standards if we\'ll get out there and support them,"" this will be a better country and we would have a better, better school system for all of our children.', ""Today I am directing the Secretary of Education to work with States and local school districts to follow up on these commission recommendations. I hope that some people here in Fresno will read this report. A lot of times, these reports are ignored, but this is a good one, and it's worth reading."", ""What I want to do is to give every State in this country explicit information about how to use the Federal funds they get to achieve the highest standards for teachers; second, to collect information from every State about what is working and share it with other States and school districts; and finally, to issue reports to let parents know how well their State, their community is doing in promoting excellence and demanding accountability. We have to set higher standards for all education, including our schools and our communities. We have to do our part, each and every one of us, if we're going to have the best schools in the world."", ""And finally, let me say we have to make sure that the young men and women who will be finishing these wonderful schools we're going to build, every single one of them, without regard to their economic circumstances and their parents, when they need, it have the opportunity to go to college and get a college education."", ""In the last 4 years, we have expanded college scholarships for needy students. We've reformed the college loan program to reduce the costs and improve the repayment terms so that you can never be charged more than a percentage of your income if you're in our direct loan program, and no one ever need fear going to college because they don't think they can repay that loan. We've got 50,000 young people working in AmeriCorps, earning money for college while they serve in their communities, but we have to do more. I want to make this commitment and ask you to share it with me. By the year 2000, we ought to make at least 2 years of education after high school, the equivalent of a community college degree, just as universal in 4 years as a high school diploma is today. And we can do that."", ""We should have a $1,500 tax credit which will cover the cost of community college education, a HOPE scholarship, for every person in this country who needs it. If we would simply pay for this in the form of a tax credit, then literally we could say we are making community college education free for you if you're responsible enough to go and do a good job. It would be one of the best investments we ever made."", 'For those who go on to 4-year schools or graduate schools, I believe we should provide a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year for the cost of tuition so people can afford to go on with their education. And I propose to let families with incomes of up to $100,000 save more money in an IRA and withdraw from that IRA without any penalty to pay for an education. That will help America open the doors of college education to all.', ""And I might say, every penny of that tax cut is paid for in my balanced budget plan, dime for dime. We're not going to let interest rates go up; we're not going to let the deficit go up; we're not going to go back in the direction that got us in so much trouble before. We're going to educate America, build America, and lift Americans up through education, all Americans."", 'Now, think of this. Think of this. If we do all these things, we will reach our dream of a bright future for all Americans who are willing to work for it, an America in which every 8year-old will be able to read, every 12-yearold will be able to log in on the Internet, every 18-year-old will be able to go to college, every parent that loses a job will be able to go back and get a better education and move up, not down, in economic well-being. And that bridge to the 21st century will be big enough and strong enough for every single one of us to walk across together. Will you help me build that bridge? [Applause]', 'Thank you, and God bless you.']"
68,William J. Clinton ,"September 12, 1996","[""The President. Wow! Thank you very much. Thank you all. Thank you for coming. Thank you for standing out here on this hot, fine day. Thank you for your enthusiasm. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you, Dr. Jerry Young, for making me feel so welcome at Chaffey College and for the work you do here. Thank you, Congressman George Brown. Ladies and gentlemen, there is not a Member of the entire Congress who knows more about the role of technology in your future, in California's future, in America's future than George Brown, and I hope you will send him back to the United States Congress so that he can continue to serve you."", ""Thank you, Kerri Matthews, thank you for your wonderful speech. Thank you for bringing your wonderful children and thank you for the power of your example. You, in your efforts to be a good parent, a good learner, and a successful worker in the future, you're what this country is all about, and I'm proud to be on the platform with you."", ""I would like to thank the folks who were here before, Lieutenant Governor Gray Davis, State Comptroller Kathleen Connell, Assemblyman Joe Baca, Mayor Bill Alexander, Art Torres, the San Bernardino County supervisors who were here, the other officials who were here, and I would like to thank the Olympians who were here, Mike Powell and Evelyn Ashford. Thank you. Where are they? They're over here somewhere. Thank you. Hi, Evelyn. Hi, Mike. Thank you."", ""I'd like to thank Karen Kraft who sang the national anthem, the Rancho Cucamonga High School Marching Cougar Band. Thank you very much. Thank you. The Loveland Church Choir, thank you for singing. I'll tell you, I have had a good time already, and I thank you for that. Thank you for these great signs out here."", ""You know, so many times in the last 4 years when I have come to California, I have come to help the people of California with a problem they had, whether it was an earthquake, a fire, a flood, a base closing, trying to protect our borders in the south—always a problem. I come today to tell you we've also been working hard to create opportunities for the people of California, and we're on the right track to the 21st century."", ""In this election season, you have to ask first of all where are we now compared to where we were 4 years ago, when we had high unemployment, stagnant wages, rising crime, a dividing society, and rising cynicism. Look at where we are today. The lowest unemployment in 7 1/2 years, 10 1/2 million new jobs, nearly 4 1/2 million new homeowners, the deficit's gone down for 4 years in a row by 60 percent, the first time that's happened since before the Civil War, in the 1840's. We're in better shape than we were 4 years ago."", 'Fifteen million of the hardest pressed working Americans got a tax cut so they could raise their children and work and not be tempted to fall back into welfare. The welfare rolls are down by 1.8 million and child support collections are up by $3 billion, 40 percent.', 'For 4 years, the crime rate has gone down, 12 million Americans got to take a little time off from work when a baby was born or a parent was sick without losing their jobs because of the family and medical leave law. On October 1st, the new minimum wage law will become effective and 10 million Americans will get a raise.', ""That law will also make every small business in America eligible for a tax cut when they buy health insurance. They'll make it easier for small businesses to invest in their businesses, to hire more people, and they will be eligible for more tax relief. And we made it easier for people who work for small businesses to take out retirement plans and to keep them when they change jobs, and so many people change jobs today that's very important."", ""And finally, that bill gave parents who adopt children a $5,000 tax credit to promote adoptive families. There's a lot of children out there who need it, and I hope it helps."", 'We passed the health care reform bill that made 25 million Americans eligible to get or keep health insurance by saying simply, you cannot lose your health insurance or be denied it now just because somebody in your family has been sick, or you moved from job to job. It can revolutionize health care security for millions of Americans.', ""And you may have noticed that at the Democratic Convention, I said that I thought we ought to do more in health care, and two things I mentioned: One, I don't think it's right to throw a new mother and her newborn child out of the hospital before at least 48 hours go by; and I believe we ought to make a beginning at providing some insurance for people. There are millions and millions and millions of families who need some health care in the mental health area, and I think we ought to make a beginning of that, and I'm here to tell you that this week, the Congress in both Houses has voted to do both those things. We are moving in the right direction, we are on the right track to the 21st century."", ""Now folks, I have tried in the last 4 years to move our country toward the America I want for the 21st century, a country in which every person, without regard to color, gender, or any other difference can live out their dreams and live up to their God-given capacity, a country where—look out at this sea of people—where all of us with all of our diversity will be able to come together and not be divided, a country that will still be the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity. And our formula is simple: We have to meet our challenges; we have to protect our values—opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and a community in which every single person who works hard and plays by the rules, no matter whatever else you want to say about them, has got a role to play, a place at the table—and we'll be walking across that bridge to the 21st century together. I want you to help me build that bridge. Will you do it? [Applause]"", 'So now, we have to ask ourselves: Are we going to build a bridge to the future, or a bridge to the past? Are we going to build a bridge where everybody can walk across because we recognize our obligations to help each other make the most of our own lives, or are we going to say, ""You\'re on your own.""', 'Frankly, folks, I think Americans ought to work the way our community colleges work. Look at this place. It is democratic—small ""d""— that is, it\'s open to all; it\'s flexible; it\'s oriented toward results; the programs have to be good and relevant, otherwise people don\'t profit from them when they leave; they\'re changing all the time; and they represent partnerships between people in business and people in education; and no one asks you what your political party is or what your position on this, that, or the other issue is. You\'re just given a chance to make the most of your own life. Nobody gives you a guarantee, but everybody gets a chance. That\'s the kind of America I want to build for everybody all the time.', ""Since I became President, I've worked as hard as I could to change the way politics works in Washington, to get away from the old who are we going to blame politics, and instead say, What are we going to do about it? How are we going to make America better? No more who to blame; let's ask what to do. No more insults; let's have a campaign and a life in America of ideas and change, positive change toward a better future."", ""We still have a lot to do if we're going to build the right kind of bridge to the 21st century. We have to provide the best educational opportunity in the world to everybody. And let me just mention two or three things. Number one, I have proposed a program to mobilize 30,000 mentors, including college students on work-study, AmeriCorps volunteers, other trained teachers to mobilize a million volunteers to go into all of our schools where there are reading problems so that every 8-year-old in America will be able to read on his or her own by the year 2000."", 'I want to have a country where every classroom in America, every single classroom and library in America is hooked up to the information superhighway, with good computers, good teachers, and the Internet and the World Wide Web for everybody. What that means is, if we do that, for the first time in history, every student in every classroom in the poorest urban areas and the most remote rural areas will have access to the same learning in the same way at the same quality in the same time as the people in the wealthiest institutions in America. It will revolutionize opportunity in education, and we have to do it.', ""I want to help our public schools to meet their challenges; to stay open later for the kids that need a place to go, a positive place to go; to have more flexibility to get greater results; to be judged by their standards; but to be given freedom from rules that stifle them. I've done a lot I'm very proud of in this area because I spent a lot of time in public schools as well as community colleges."", 'One of the things that California has led the way in is in the creation of new schools in public school districts, called charter schools, where a group of teachers gets together and says, ""Here\'s who we\'re going to serve. Here\'s what we\'re going to produce. Give us a charter and if we don\'t produce it, take it away from us. Hold us accountable. We\'ll educate our children better.""', ""There are about 350 of these schools in America today, 90 of them in California. Today, we released another $1 1/4 million to put 12 more in California, and if you will give me 4 more years, we'll build 3,000 more in America and all across this country."", 'Finally, let me say that we have to make college education available to every single solitary person in America. Within 4 years, if we do the right things, we can make a degree from a community college just as universal in America as a high school diploma is today. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', ""Here's how we're going to do it. I propose to give families a tax credit, a dollar-for-dollar reduction in their taxes for the cost of the average community college tuition for 2 years so that everybody can afford to go to community college. We'll make it free. All you have to do is show up, do a good job, make your grades, learn, and go on to build a better life. It'll make America stronger."", 'And I want to make it easier for people to go on to 4-year schools, to postgraduate education, for older people to go back to college. So we also propose a $10,000 tax deduction for the cost of any college tuition after high school for people of any age. We will do this. And when we do, America will be stronger.', 'Finally, let me say that I think families ought to be able to save, and save more through an IRA, an individual retirement account, and then withdraw from it without any tax penalty for education or buying a first home or taking care of their health care needs. Now, we can revolutionize educational opportunity. If we do those things and you keep doing your job here, we will be able to say in 4 years, ""We\'ve opened the doors of college to every person in America and a college education at least at a community college is just as universal in the year 2000 as a high school diploma was 4 years ago."" Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', ""We have to keep working to keep this economy growing. California's suffered too much and too long, and there are still people here who want jobs who don't have them. That means we have to keep interest rates down and investment going. That means we have to balance the budget, yes, but we have to do it in a way that continues to invest in the technologies of the future and the education of our people, in the protection of the environment, and providing the protection that Medicare and Medicaid give to children, to families with disabilities, and to the elderly. We don't want to divide this country, and we don't have to, to balance the budget. Will you help me do it in the right way? [Applause] That's an important part of our bridge to the 21st century."", ""We have to build a bridge to the 21st century that keeps the crime rate coming down. We've got 4 years of declining crime. The leaders of our friends in the other party, they fought us on the crime bill. They're still against putting 100,000 police on the street, although for the life of me I can't figure out why. They were against the Brady bill, they were against the assault weapons ban. They told people they would lose their weapons. Well, it's 4 years later. Not a single hunter, not a single sportsman has lost a single weapon. But 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers did not get handguns to terrorize the American people because of the Brady bill, and we are safer because of it."", 'We ought to go further. We ought to ban the cop-killer bullets and we ought to extend the Brady bill and say, ""If you have brutalized your spouse or your child, you ought not to be eligible to get a handgun either."" Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', ""We passed welfare reform, but all it does is give us a chance to reform welfare. It says, now people on welfare will still get health care for their kids and nutrition and child care, if they take a job, more than ever before. But the income must now be used to move people to work. So I have a plan to create a million jobs. I don't want to see children and their parents in the street. I want everybody working and succeeding at home and at work. Will you help me create those million jobs to put people to work who have never had it before? [Applause]"", ""I want us to build a stronger American community and a stronger and safer world. That means we have to build strong families. I'm proud of the fact that the first bill I signed was the family and medical leave law, and I'd like to see it expanded a little to say you can also keep your job and still have a little time off to take your child to the doctor or to that parent-teacher conference at the school. It'll make America stronger."", ""We've had 10 1/2 million new jobs since I signed the family leave law; it's been good for business because when families are happy, when they're succeeding at raising their children, they're more productive at work and they make America stronger. Let it be our goal to say, success at home and success at work go hand in hand. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", ""Let me say, in California you know we have to build a bridge that protects our environment. I'm proud that we've destroyed more toxic waste dumps in 3 years than were destroyed in the 12 years before I took office; proud that our air is cleaner, that our food is safer; very, very proud that we created the country's largest national park south of Alaska here in California in the Mojave Desert; very proud that we saved Yellowstone from a gold mine and that we are moving forward on a whole broad range of fronts."", ""But we still have problems. Ten million American children—10 million—live within 4 miles of a toxic waste dump, and that's wrong. In 4 more years, if you will give them to us, we'll close 500 of those dumps, the worst ones, because our children should grow up next to parks, not poison. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'Finally, let me say that we have to build a bridge to the 21st century that is safe for our children. I am so proud of the fact that just a couple of days ago, almost every country in the world—only three voting no—voted to ban the testing of nuclear weapons forever. We are making this a safer world.', ""I'm proud of the fact that there are no nuclear missiles pointed at America's children for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age, proud that your country is leading the way to peace and prosperity. But we have more to do. We have more to do. You saw it in Iraq. We cannot allow anybody anywhere to believe they are not bound by the rules of civilized behavior."", ""So I say again, I don't want to get in a word war with Saddam Hussein, but we're going to do whatever it takes to keep him from threatening his neighbors, threatening our pilots, and we're going to enforce the no-fly zone."", ""Let me make this last point: I believe that all of you, particularly those of you who are young, who have more tomorrows than yesterdays to look forward to—I believe you will grow up in a more peaceful world than any we've known in a long, long time. But we know it's not a world free of threats. We know we have to deal with terrorism. We know we have to deal with all the ethnic and racial and religious wars that still engulf the world. We know we have to deal with organized crime and drug smuggling. We know we have to deal with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."", ""That's why I have worked so hard to rally the nations of the world to say we're going to have zero tolerance for terrorism, and why we're working so hard to make airline travel and airports safer in America. And I want you to support what we're trying to do."", ""But today in the United States Senate, there's a big decision being made that most people have never talked about. They're debating something called the Chemical Weapons Convention. It is a treaty that will increase the safety of our soldiers and our citizens by reducing the dangers posed by poison gas. That seems a long way away but, remember, it wasn't so very long ago that a lot of innocent citizens were killed in Japan by a fanatic terrorist who exposed them to poison gas in a subway. We've got to do everything we possibly can to minimize the exposure of our people to this gas."", 'Now, this treaty was negotiated by President Bush. Then I submitted it to the Senate 3 years ago for ratification. This has been a bipartisan effort all along the way; General Colin Powell supports it; President Bush is working for it; his National Security Adviser is working for it; the Joint Chiefs of Staff are working for it, but bitter partisan debate has broken out in the last few days and has threatened to derail this treaty. I want you to be protected from the dangers of poison gas insofar as we can humanly do it, and I ask you to join with me in asking the Senate to resolve the remaining questions, put partisanship aside, and put America on the side of a safer world without poison gas being exposed to our citizens or our soldiers. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', ""Now, before I go, let me just ask you to remember what I said about the community colleges. Don't you want a country in which we're coming together, instead of being divided?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Don\'t you want a country in which we all roll up our sleeves and say, ""We\'re going to work together to give each other the chance to make the most of our lives?""', 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. Don't you think my wife was right when she said it takes a village to raise a child?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. Don't you think that we're far better off building a bridge to the future than a bridge to the past?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. I want you to think about this. Just look around this crowd today. Look around this crowd. When I represented the United States at the opening of the Olympics and I watched all the teams come in, it was thrilling to me that there were people from 197 different nations there. And then I remembered I was looking at our own team, when Hillary and Chelsea and I went to visit with them, and I thought, you know, if the people from America, if they didn\'t have the American outfits on, you wouldn\'t have a clue where they were from. If you herded the American team up, you could say, ""Well, that one\'s from Africa; that one\'s from Scandinavia; that one\'s from the Middle East; this one\'s from Asia; this one\'s from India."" They were from everywhere.', 'There were 197 nations represented at the Olympics. In Los Angeles County there are people from 150 of those 197 places. And I want you to think about that, not only today, not only for the next 8 weeks, but for the rest of your life. This is a country founded 220 years ago by people who said, ""We believe all people are created equal.""', 'We didn\'t behave that way then. We don\'t behave that way perfectly today, but that\'s what we believe. And we have to stand up and say to everybody, ""If you believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, if you\'re willing to show up tomorrow and be a good citizen and work hard, you\'re our kind of American. We don\'t need to know anything else about you. You\'re part of our American community."" Will you help me build a bridge that all Americans can walk across to the 21st century? [Applause]', 'Keep your spirits up, keep your determination up, and keep your eye on the future. Thank you, and God bless you.']"
69,William J. Clinton ,"September 15, 1996","[""The President. Thank you very much. It's good to be back. How many of you were here 4 years ago? [Applause] How many of you weren't here 4 years ago? [Applause] Four years from now, we're going to have to rent the next farm to have this. Let's keep going."", ""Let me say to all of you how very happy I am to be here. I'm sorry I wasn't here from the beginning. I'm sorry I missed Tom Arnold and my buddy Jerry Jeff Walker. Maybe they'll play a little on the way out while I'm shaking hands. But I'm glad they came here and thank them both for being here."", ""I want to thank those who are here to support us: Attorney General Tom Miller, Agriculture Secretary Dale Cochran. Mike Peterson gave a heck of a speech up here a few minutes ago. He'll be a good candidate someday. I want to thank Mayor Kelley of Indianola, Mayor Davis of Des Moines."", 'I want to thank Tom and Ruth and Jenny and Amy for serving the State of Iowa. I want you to know that Ruth Harkin has played a major role in the efforts that our administration have made to sell more American products around the world and get more American investment and have fair as well as free trade. And I thank her. You should all be very proud of her for the work she did as head of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.', ""I thank Senator Harkin for what he said but, more importantly, for what he has done and been to the people of Iowa, to the people of the United States, and to the President. He has been nothing short of magnificent in his service to our country and to this State in the last 4 years since I've been in Washington."", 'I can\'t tell you all the times that I have turned to Tom Harkin in the last 4 years when things were on the line for America, when we had to pass an economic plan to get the deficit down, to get the interest rates down, to get the economy going again. And Iowa is a strong two-party State; we\'re going to try to change that a little this time. And our friends in the other party were saying, ""Oh, the President\'s economic plan is just awful. It will increase the deficit; it will bankrupt the economy; it will hurt people."" Every single one of them to the person lined up and said no. It\'s unfortunate for them because 4 years later we got 10 1/2 million new jobs, lower interest rates, record numbers of small businesses, American exports at an alltime high, businesses owned by women and minorities at an all-time high. They all said no, but Tom Harkin said yes. We got a 7 1/2 -year low in our unemployment rate. Thank you, Tom Harkin, for making the difference and for fighting for us.', 'Then there was the family and medical leave law. They all said—their nominee is still saying, ""It was a terrible mistake, that law, bad for business."" Glad he led the fight against it. We just had a bipartisan survey about the family and medical leave law, and the 12 million American families that got to take a little time off from work when a baby was born or a parent was sick without losing their jobs, they said it didn\'t hurt. And I say one of the biggest challenges you have today, every one of you, is to create a country in which families can succeed at home and at work. It\'s good for the economy to help people be good parents, good children, good family members. Thank goodness we had Tom Harkin to fight the good fight.', ""We said the crime rate was too high in America and we needed to do something to bring it down; we ought to put 100,000 police on the street. They didn't like that idea very much. And I might add, in the last 2 years, for reasons that totally escape me, they've tried to stop us from continuing to finish the job. But for the first time in who knows how long, the crime rate has gone down in America for 4 years. And if you leave Tom Harkin on the job and give us a little help, we'll take it down for 4 more years, so the American people can feel safe on their street."", ""I thank you for what you said, Tom, about the flood. When I was a Governor in a State that had a lot of natural disasters, I learned that the Federal response was too often disorganized and inadequate, driven by appointees who got the job because of their politics instead of their knowledge about the issue. So I put a person in charge of our emergency management who had done it for me at home and before that had been a county judge dealing with disasters and didn't care anything about the politics of it; he just wanted the American people in their time of need to be well-served, taken care of, and thought somebody in Washington ought to understand what it takes to get the job done. That's why we were able to serve Iowa and the rest of the Middle West well in that 500year flood."", ""And I thank you for what you said, but when I ran for President I wanted to make good things happen. And when I look at the farm prices, when I look at farm assets, when I look at the direction of the economy here, I'd say we're a lot better off than we were 4 years ago, and we ought to keep going in the same direction."", 'Let me say to you, to echo what Senator Harkin said, this is a huge election. This is the last election of the 20th century, to elect the first President of the 21st century.', ""Audience member. And you're going to win!"", 'The President. I am if you keep that same attitude for the next 51 days. But I want all of you to think about this.', 'Audience member. We love you, man!', 'The President. You have to understand what is at stake. That\'s why this Senate race is so important. That\'s why these five fine people behind me who are running as our candidates for the House are so important. If you look at the challenges facing our country, in spite of everything, we clearly had the ability to balance the budget in the last 2 years. And they said, ""We\'re going to shut the Government down if you don\'t do it our way. We\'re going to give you a tax cut, Mr. President, and people in your income group whether you want it or not. And we\'re going to cut Medicare. We\'re going to walk away from the guarantee Medicaid has given for 30 years to middle class families whose parents were in nursing homes and had children with disabilities. And if you don\'t like it—we\'re going to increase the cost of student loans. We\'re going to cut Head Start. We\'re going to cut the safe and drug-free schools program. We\'re going to wreck 25 years of bipartisan commitment to preserving our environment. We\'re going to raise taxes on the 9 million Americans with the lowest incomes with children in their house. That\'s our balanced budget plan. If you don\'t like it, we\'re going to shut the Government down."" And I said, ""The Democratic Party does not love the Government, it loves the people. The Government should serve them. Shut her down. Shut her down.""', 'And yes, after you and the people of this country all over the country got their attention with repeated public opinion polls and strong disapproval of what was going on, they said, ""Oh, well, maybe we\'ll allow some good things to happen."" So we got the minimum wage increase, and we got the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill. And we made it easier for small-business people to take out retirement plans. And we did a lot of good things. But don\'t forget what is really hanging in the balance.', ""Don't forget what the budget battle said. I'm telling you, folks, there is a new Democratic Party. We have proved that we are the party of responsibility when handling people's money. We did lower the deficit 4 years in a row for the first time since before the Civil War. I'm proud of that. But we did it in a way that kept faith with the children of America and the parents of America and the disabled of America and the people who deserve to go forward with us together. We need more help in that way."", ""We proved that we would bring the crime rate down. They tried to convince every hunter in my State that they were going to lose their guns if we banned assault weapons and passed the Brady bill. And by the votes in '94, they did a good job of their efforts. They've got a real problem now. We've had two hunting seasons; there hasn't been a hunter in America lose their rifle. It's inconvenient for their rhetoric. But you know what, 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers did lose the right to get a gun to keep brutalizing the American people. We were right, and they were wrong."", 'They talked a lot about welfare. Finally they passed a bill I could sign. But while they were talking, we were working on it. You know, there are nearly 2 million fewer people on welfare today than there were when I was here 4 years ago, 2 million people moving into jobs, working, supporting their families.', 'So I say to you, we need people who believe in work and family, who believe in opportunity and responsibility, who believe in community and the Congress. And therefore, I want you to send Tom Harkin back to the Senate with the largest margin he has ever received and send these folks to the House of Representatives to help us do the job.', 'At times like this when countries have to make big decisions that will affect the lives of people far into the future and when things are changing greatly—and believe me, things are changing greatly—these students in the crowd, in 10 years they will be doing jobs that have not been invented yet. Some of them will be doing jobs that have not even been imagined yet. We have to make the right decisions. And there are some big decisions to be made.', 'And I have to say with all respect, I agreed with one thing my opponent said in his speech in San Diego—and what I said, this really is an election where you have to choose whether you want a leader who says, ""You\'re on your own,"" or one that says, my wife is right, it does take a village to raise a child and build a community and build a country.', 'You have to choose. You have to choose. You have to choose whether you believe, as Senator Harkin said, in those politicians who are always looking for what they call wedge issues—""Oh, this is a great wedge issue; we can divide the American people, get them all torn up and upset, and we can get in power""—or whether you believe, like me, that we\'ve had enough of that ""who\'s to blame"" business. And it works better, and we\'ve proved it works better, if you say, ""Forget about who\'s to blame. What are we going to do to make a greater country for all the American people and pull the American people together? ""', ""We have to choose—most important of all— we have to choose whether you believe this election is about trying to build a bridge to the past, which nobody has ever done or ever will succeed in doing, or whether you're willing to join with me to build a bridge to the future we can all walk into the 21st century across proudly, together."", ""I want to build a bridge to the 21st century with a strong and growing economy. That means balance the budget, all right, to keep these interest rates coming down. But it means do it in a way that continues to invest in education and the environment, in medical research and technology, and protects our obligations to those who need our help through Medicare and Medicaid. Will you help me build that bridge to America's future? [Applause]"", ""I want to build a bridge to the future that will help our economy to go through the right kind of tax cut. It is in this administration that we have increased by 250 percent the tax cuts available to small businesses who invest more in their business to grow the business, to hire more people, to become more productive. But it has to be the right kind. I want a tax cut that's targeted to people who will use it for education, for raising their children, for buying that first home, for dealing with medical emergencies, an IRA that you can withdraw from without any tax penalty for education or medical cost or buying a first home, a $500-a-child tax credit, an education credit, things that we can do that will grow this country."", ""But I'll tell you something, folks, mine are paid for, and we've got to pay for them. We don't want to go back to that old time when we promised you a tax cut on the one hand and wrecked the economy on the other."", ""Now, last year the leaders of the other party said something that I agreed with, and I want to tell you what they said last year before the election started. They said if we get off of this balanced budget plan, if we don't have a plan to keep bringing this deficit down, interest rates will be 2 percent higher. Now, I want every farmer in this crowd, every business person in this crowd, every student in this crowd, every family in this crowd to think what that means. Think what it would mean to have 2 more percent on your credit card payment, your car payment, your home payment, your farm loan, or your business loan. I don't think we want that."", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. Let's have a tax cut we can afford. Let's help the folks that need it that are building this country. Let's create opportunity and strengthen families with our tax cut, but let's keep on the work of balancing the budget until we get the job done and we keep the interest rates down and we keep the economy going."", ""And I want to build a bridge to the 21st century where America continues to sell its products around the world. I'm proud of the fact that our exports and, yes, our agricultural exports, are at an all-time high. If you'll give us 4 more years we'll add pork to those exports. We'll be selling them all over the world, and Iowa will be better. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", ""But let's face it, you and I know the most important thing we could do to build the right kind of bridge to the 21st century is to give every single child in America the opportunity to have a world-class education. And I just want to mention, Iowa for years and years and years had led the way in proving that a good education builds good citizens, strong families, strong communities, successful careers, and a greater country. Iowa has led the way. Every child in America deserves the education that the people of Iowa have given their children for decades. And I'm going to do my best to give it to them if you'll give us 4 more years."", 'And I just want to mention two things that I think are important parts of building that bridge. We have the opportunity right now, because of technology, because of the Internet, because of the World Wide Web, because of all these things that all these young folks know a lot more about than I do, we have a chance to do something that this country has never done. If we will do what Al Gore and I have been calling for and connect every school and every library, every classroom to the information superhighway by the year 2000, for the first time in the history of America, children in the most isolated rural districts, children in the poorest urban districts will have access to the same learning at the same quality at the same time in the same way that the richest classes in America have. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. And I want to build a bridge to the 21st century that says to every person in America of any age who needs to do it, we will make a college education available to you.', 'Our plan is pretty simple. First of all, we say, do no harm. Continue to resist the efforts of the other party to make it harder to get student loans and to raise the cost of the student loans. We want to keep that direct loan program. I pledged to you 4 years ago when I came here, if you voted for me I would pass a student loan program that would reduce the cost of student loans and let people pay it back as a percentage of their income, so no matter how much they had to borrow they would always be able to afford to go to college. We kept that commitment, and I want to keep it going.', ""Now what I want to do is two simple things. First of all, let's make a commitment that in the next 4 years we'll make at least a 2-year community college education as universal in America as a high school diploma is today. And here's how to do it. We can do that simply by giving the American people a $1,500 tax credit so they can reduce the cost of tuition at the typical community college, dollar for dollar from their tax bill, for 2 years. If we do that, we can say—and we can afford that; it requires no bureaucracy, no nothing; almost every American is within driving distance of a good 2-year education—we can say, we're going to make this as universal in 4 years as a high school education has been for the last 20. Will you help me do that? [Applause]"", ""And finally, we ought to say, we believe that people should be able to deduct the cost of tuition up to $10,000 a year for any education after high school, 4 years, postgraduate, medical school, you name it, whatever it takes. Let's pay and let people go to college and get the education they need. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause] Will you do that for your children and your grandchildren? [Applause] That is the kind of opportunity agenda that will get us into the next century able to say with a clear conscience and absolute certainty, the American dream is alive and well for everyone who's willing to work for it."", ""The second thing I want to say about that is, we've got to have more responsibility. We've got to continue to work to drive the crime rate down, as I said. We passed the welfare reform bill. I want to tell you about it because I want all of you to support what we have to do. The new bill says we'll still give poor families medical care, nutrition, if they go to work, guaranteed child care because they need that. But the check is now going to go to the States and the local communities, and they have to use that check to create jobs for able-bodied people."", 'Now, here\'s what it\'s going to take. We can use that money—I was in Kansas City last week, and they\'re using that money. They say, ""Will you hire somebody on welfare and create a new job? If you will, we\'ll give you the check as a wage supplement. We\'ll guarantee their health care."" But you cannot tell people, folks with little kids, they have got to work unless there is work for them to do. Will you help me create jobs so that we can prove that welfare reform is a second chance, not a way of life, a way to dignity and work and integrity? [Applause] That is important if we\'re going to build a bridge to the 21st century.', ""Perhaps the deepest and longest and most intense fights of the last 2 years have been over the environment. I grew up in a farming State like Iowa. I governed one. I know that we can find ways to preserve the environment and grow the economy, whether it's a farm economy or an industrial economy or a small-business economy. But that's exactly what we've got to do."", 'I signed a bill the other day, the pesticide protection act, which will improve the quality of our food, supported by every farm group in America because it also gives more reasonable regulations to farmers across a broader range of activities. We can do this right. We have worked hard.', ""We've worked hard with the auto industry to produce a clean car that will get triple the mileage of the present car. We're making progress. But we also worked with them to bring back the auto industry so that today the United States auto industry is number one in sales around the world for the first time in nearly 20 years. We can do both things. Only they believe you have to hurt the environment to grow the economy. That is not true. And let me just give you one example."", ""We closed more toxic waste sites in the last 3 years than they did in 12. But it's not enough. There are still 10 million—think of this; look at these kids here—there are still 10 million American children living within 4 miles of a toxic waste dump. So if you give us 4 more years, we'll close 500 more, the two-thirds worst, and our kids will be growing up next to parks, not poison. Will you help us build that kind of bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", ""Well, that's it. We're in better shape than we were 4 years ago: 10 1/2 million more jobs, 12 million people using family leave, 15 million families with a tax cut that need it the most, every small business in the country eligible for one if they invest more in their business, 40 million more Americans with their pensions protected, 50 million more Americans breathing cleaner air, 10 million Americans on October 1st will get an increase in the minimum wage, and that's a good, good thing. This country is moving in the right direction."", 'But there is so much more to do before we can say we have preserved the American dream for everybody who is willing to work for it, we have maintained the leadership of our country for peace and freedom and prosperity, and we are doing it by building the American community.', ""You know, one of the biggest problems in this old world today—you look at Bosnia; we had these elections in Bosnia yesterday. Thank goodness we've had 9 months of peace. And we had these elections, and they did pretty well, considering what they've been through the last 4 years. And I thank all of you who supported what I tried to do there. But you think about the world that we're living in. Look at Bosnia; look at Northern Ireland; look at the Middle East; look at what South Africa went through. Look at what happened in Burundi, for goodness sakes, over tribal differences. Why?"", 'All over the world there are people who make a living getting political power, getting military power, staying in power by inflaming the passions of people, by trying to get them to look down on their neighbors. ""You really matter because you\'re not them; you\'re not them."" That\'s what they say in the Middle East, ""You\'re not them."" That\'s what they said in Bosnia. They were slaughtering each other\'s children because they weren\'t Croatian or Serbian or Muslim. And they were biologically completely indistinguishable. It was an accident of history that got them into different so-called ethnic or religious groups.', 'And you look around this crowd today. I see Asian-Americans. I see African-Americans. I see Nordic-Americans. I see Irish-Americans. I see German-Americans. I see Americans of Central European descent. I see Indian-Americans and Pakistani-Americans and Native Americans and you name it. You know why? Because we are trying to beat that curse that is bedeviling the rest of the world and threatens the 21st century.', 'And so when you see—[applause]—that\'s the last thing I want to leave you with. I don\'t want to build a bridge that you only get to walk across because you\'re better than somebody else because of an accident of birth. I want to build a bridge that anybody can walk across if they say, ""I believe in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights. I believe in the fundamental dignity of all people. And if you\'re willing to show up for work tomorrow, play by the rules, and love this country the way I do, I\'ll hold your hand, and we\'ll build a bridge we can walk across together."" And if you\'ll do that, we\'ll have a great victory in November.', 'Thank you, and God bless you.']"

And I thank you for doing such a good job as mayor. And Representative Mallory, that's the most unusual welcome I ever had, but I liked it. We may have to have a training session to get that down and use it in some other places."", ""I wonder if you're all in such a good humor today because the Bengals won yesterday. I think that may be it."", 'Audience member. We love you, Bill!', 'The President. Thank you.', 'I want to say a special word of thanks to Senator John Glenn for flying down here with me and for being an absolutely wonderful United States Senator for Ohio and for all the United States. Thank you, John Glenn.', ""I thank the leaders of the FOP. Thank you, President Gil Gallegos, for that wonderful statement. Thank you, Pete Ridder. Thank you, Jim Pasco, the executive director of the FOP; Steve Young, the president of the Ohio FOP; and Mike Tenore, the trustee of the Ohio FOP. I am very proud to have the endorsement of an organization representing 270,000 rank and file members of law enforcement who put their lives on the line every single day for the rest of us. I thank you for it. As Gil said and as Pete said, for 4 years I've worked hard to stand with the police officers of America, and I am profoundly honored that they decided to stand with me for 4 more years. And I thank them very much."", ""Folks, I want to talk to you just a moment about what I hope we'll do in those next 4 years to make our streets safer and to make our children's future brighter. Everybody knows now—I hope they do anyway—we've been out talking about where we are now compared to where we were 4 years ago. We pursued a strategy of opportunity for everyone, responsibility from everyone, and an American community that includes every person without regard to race or gender or income or background. Everybody that's willing to work hard and play by the rules should be part of our American community."", ""This strategy is working. The economy is much stronger. The economy in Ohio—the unemployment rate has dropped from 7 percent to 4.8 percent. It's the lowest in nearly 8 years in the country as a whole. Our auto industry is number one in the world again for the first time since the 1970's. A lot of people in Ohio are part of that ranking, that number one ranking. We have 10 1/2 million more jobs. Wages are rising again for the first time in a decade. On October 1st 10 million American workers will get an increase when the minimum wage goes up. And I'm happy about that."", ""Yesterday I was in Iowa on a farm in Indianola, and I met, as I often do when I'm out and around, another of the 12 million American working parents who've gotten to take a little time off when a baby was born or a parent was sick without losing their job because of the family and medical leave law. And that's made us a stronger nation."", ""Twenty-five million Americans—25 million Americans can be helped because the Congress finally passed the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that says you can't lose your health insurance just because someone in your family's been sick or because you changed your job. Forty million Americans—because of the pension protection act of 1994, 40 million retired and still working Americans had their pensions protected, and I am very proud of that. I remember well when they weren't protected 10 years ago and how many people lost their retirement."", 'So it is clear that we are moving this country on the right track. The things—as the Vice President used to say—the things that ought to be up are now up, the things that ought to be down are now down; 1.8 million fewer people on welfare than 4 years ago, child support collections up 40 percent. What should be up is up; what should be down is down. This is good.', 'These things did not happen by accident. These things happened because we had a different philosophy of how the White House and Washington should work. I had never worked in Washington, except as a college student, until I became President. And I didn\'t like what I saw. There were too many people spending their time asking, ""Who can I blame for this problem?"" and too few people spending their time asking, ""What are we going to do about this problem?"" So we asked that question: What are we going to do? And then we proceeded to do it.', ""And I can tell you that I hope that's what this election will be about. I hope we will have 50 days of people putting forth their best ideas about what are we going to do—ideas, not insults. How are we going to build the country? How are we going to build that bridge to the 21st century that we can all walk across?"", ""Mostly I want to talk to you about law enforcement today, but I want you to think just briefly about how we're going to keep this economy growing until everybody who is willing to work can participate in it. And I'll just mention three things."", ""Number one, we have to continue the work of balancing the budget, but we have to do it in a way that protects Medicare, Medicaid, education, the environment, medical research, and other scientific research and technology. That is important. John Glenn has devoted an entire public career to it, but it's a huge thing."", 'We have some people here in their wheelchairs today. For the first time because of medical research in the last few weeks, laboratory animals that had their spines severed have had nerve transplants that gave them movement in their lower limbs for the first time ever. This is important. We have to keep investing in this.', ""Our space program is helping us to unlock mysteries of the environment, mysteries of health care. We're sending two unmanned space missions to Mars at the end of this year. We will learn some things about Mars but more importantly we'll learn a lot more about Earth, because we have continued the space program that John Glenn pioneered. We dare not turn our back on research and technology in the future."", ""And for all you young people in the audience who really understand computers, I'll just give you one more. I'll just give you one more. We just joined in a research project with IBM to build, within the next couple of years, a supercomputer that will do more calculations in one second than you can go home and do on your hand-held calculator in 30,000 years."", ""So we have to balance the budget, but we have to keep investing in things that take care of people who need it and that invest in our future, that grow our economy, and spread opportunity. We ought to have a tax cut, but it ought to be a tax cut that's focused on the needs of childrearing and education and health care and buying or selling a home. And we ought to pay for it so we can still balance the budget."", 'We ought to continue to work until we have the finest educational system in the world for everybody. Every 8-year-old should be able to read; every 12-year-old should be able to log in on the Internet; and every 18-year-old in America ought to be able to go to college. We ought to guarantee that 2 years of college are as universal as a high school diploma.', ""I want to say that again. I want you to understand exactly what I propose. I propose to make 2 years of college, a community college degree, in 4 years only just as universal as a high school diploma is today by giving a tax credit, a dollarfor-dollar reduction on taxes of up to $1,500, which will cover the average tuition costs at any community college in the country. And then beyond that, saying that if you go to college, no matter what your age or what kind of program you're in, a 4-year program, a graduate program, you name it, you ought to be able to deduct the cost of the tuition from your taxes up to $10,000—everybody. That will make a big difference to America."", ""The third thing we have to do to build this economy is to make sure we have enough jobs in the places where there haven't been any jobs yet. We now have a welfare reform bill that says to poor people we will take care of your children's medical care, nutritional needs, and when you go to work we'll give you child care; but now the income check you used to get if you're able-bodied, after 2 years you've got to be working for that check. That's a good thing if there's a job there. Now we have to put the jobs there. That's a big part of building our bridge to the 21st century."", ""So we have to build a bridge to the 21st century that leaves us a stronger community, and I will just, again, mention three things briefly. Number one, the family and medical leave law has helped a lot of people, but it can only be used in emergencies or for childbirth. I favor a narrow expansion of it which says people ought to also not lose their jobs if they need a little time off from work to go to a regular parent-teacher conference or take their children or their parents to the doctor. I think that's important as well."", ""John Glenn—we talked a lot about the environment. The air is cleaner; our food is safer; we cleaned up more toxic waste sites in 3 years than were cleaned up in the previous 12. Let me just give you one chilling statistic. In spite of all that, 10 million American kids still live within 4 miles of a toxic waste dump—10 million. In 4 more years, we're going to double the pace at which we're doing the cleanup, clean up the 500 worst ones so we can say these children, wherever they live, they're growing up next to parks, not poison. That ought to be a part of the bridge we build to the 21st century."", ""We want to be part of a world that's growing ever more peaceful and prosperous, and that means that we have to work hard to face the new problems of the 21st century. We have to finish the old problems that we've dealt with."", ""We have now got all the countries in the world but three agreed to a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, no more testing of nuclear weapons. But we now have to fight terrorism. We have to fight drug running. We have to fight organized crime. We have to fight the proliferation of biological and chemical weapons. Senator Glenn and I tried to pass the Chemical Weapons Convention to protect our soldiers and our people from the kind of attack the Japanese people had in the Tokyo subway from a terrorist group. We didn't get it for political reasons. But we're going to get it first thing next year to make this a safer country in a newer world."", 'Now, all that will not make any difference unless we can make our streets safer. The children of this country ought to be safe at home, in school, on their streets, in their play yards. I get asked all the time, ""Well, how do you define success in the war against crime? There will always be some crime."" Yes, there will. These folks in uniform, they\'ll always be in some risk. Yes, they will. The crime rate has come down for 4 years in a row for the first time in a long time. I\'m proud of that. But it\'s still too high, and we all know it.', 'You know how you\'ll know that we\'ve whipped this problem? When you go home from work in the evening and you flip on the evening news, if the first story is a violent crime story, instead of saying ""what else is new,"" you are absolutely shocked and appalled. When that happens, you will know that we\'re on the right side of the crime problem.', ""But we're moving in the right direction. The 100,000 new police officers supporting people in a community working together, they're making a difference. Since 1994, we've already funded about half of those. We have to finish the job. It's a major point of contention in this election. And it's very important."", ""We have put tougher penalties on the books for repeat offenders, especially, and violent offenders so the police don't do their work and see it undone by the laws that are on the books. We don't believe that police should be easily outgunned by gangs on the street. That's why we took the assault weapons off the street and passed the Brady bill and why we're against the cop-killer bullets."", 'We passed the ""three strikes and you\'re out"" law. For people who commit three serious crimes, no more parole. It\'s working. It\'s working. We\'re indicting people, convicting people under it. And it\'s working. We expanded the death penalty to include drug kingpins and police killers because I thought it was important and justified in those circumstances. The 19 assault weapons we took off the streets had only one purpose, to kill other people.', 'When we passed the assault weapons ban and we passed the Brady bill a lot of good people who voted for those bills were defeated in 1994 in their race for Congress because the interest group that was against them went out and told good, God-fearing people from Ohio and Arkansas and other places that the President had gone off the deep end, and he and the Congress had voted to take their guns away, put their guns in danger. Well, they got a lot of votes with that line in 1994. But they got a big problem in 1996.', 'Audience member. Yes, they do.', ""The President. They got a big problem because, you see, what they didn't tell their people was that we also protected 650 different hunting and sporting weapons from being regulated or confiscated by Government authorities. So now two hunting seasons have come and gone, and not a single hunter in Ohio or Arkansas has lost their weapon. They did not tell the truth. But a lot of criminals don't have assault weapons, and 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers could not get a handgun because of the Brady bill. We did the right thing. They were right. They're safer. And we need to stay after it."", ""And that's why we should ban these cop-killer bullets. The same crowd is against banning copkiller bullets. I don't know why. You know, like most people from my home State, I spent a little time when I was a boy living on a farm. I lived in a town where you could be in the woods within 5 minutes. I've been in the woods in every season you can imagine. And I have yet to see a deer, a duck, a quail, a wild turkey wearing a bulletproof vest. I do not see it. [Laughter] We ought to ban the cop-killer bullets and protect these people."", ""We passed the Violence Against Women Act to try to help deal especially with problems of domestic violence. All over the country police departments like the one here in Cincinnati are training people to be sensitive to that. I met a young officer in the Nashville police department who grew up in a family with five children where they had a lot of problems. And he's devoting his entire life to helping police departments all over America deal with this problem as well as his own. And after one year of focusing on this problem, they cut the death rate in Nashville in half—in one year."", ""We now have a hotline, 1-800-799-SAFE— I've got it on my—and we now have had over 45,000 calls to that hotline this year from people who are asking for information to try to minimize that kind of violence. We can turn that around, too, with citizens helping us on the hotline and helping their local police departments. We can change the circumstances under which too many Americans have lived for too long. You do not have to put up with unacceptable rates of crime and violence. That is the message of this day."", 'But I want to go back to one other thing Gil Gallegos said. This administration is not responsible for any of these ideas. We got all these ideas from law enforcement people themselves. All we did was listen and act. All we did was take what was working and try to go national with it. All we did was to try to empower the people who live in communities all over America who are sick about crime and violence to do something about it. That is all we have done. That was our job. We did it. Now you have to help, too.', ""But we cannot expect the police officers to do all of this, and we cannot expect to jail our way out of this problem. You heard Gil say that. We've also supported zero tolerance for guns and drugs in schools. We've supported things like school uniforms and tough truancy laws and curfews. We've supported an effort to mobilize another one million Americans to work in citizens groups, to work with local police departments. We got the cellular telephone industry to donate thousands and thousands of cellular phones to help these community neighborhood watch groups support the police; they cannot do it alone."", ""And most of all, we have to realize that we have to give our children some things to say yes to as well as some things to say no to. They're entitled to schools that are open after hours. They're entitled to recreation opportunities. They need those summer jobs. They need opportunities like AmeriCorps. They need those good, positive things. That's why we fought for the drug education, the gang prevention programs, all of these other things."", ""You know, I don't know how many little kids have told me what an impression their D.A.R.E. officer made on them at the school. We know now that one of the reasons we've got a real problem with youth drug abuse is that, going way back to 1990, young people began to get the idea again that this was not dangerous. Well, that's wrong. It's not just illegal, it is dangerous. They can kill children. They can destroy their ability to concentrate. For young women, they can undermine their ability to bear healthy children. And we need everyone in the community supporting law enforcement officers, getting that message out to our children, to every child, no matter where he or she lives. It is important."", ""General Barry McCaffrey, a four-star general, was appointed to lead our war on drugs after he led our troops south of the border and did so much to keep drugs from coming into America. His strategy is targeted at doing those things which will keep drugs away from our children. We've proposed the largest antidrug effort in history, and I hope Congress will give us the extra $700 million we asked for, so that we can do everything possible to really, effectively turn these trends around and make sure that we have drug use going down, not just among adults, which it is—cocaine use has dropped by a third among adults in the last 4 years— we have got to get drug use going down among our children. We can't have these kids out there believing they are not in danger when they are, and you have to help."", ""Let me say that in the next 4 years one thing we have to focus more on is the violence caused by gangs, which is also often related to drug dealing. Over and over and over again, we hear stories of totally innocent children who just happened to be standing on the wrong street corner, happened to be walking in the wrong neighborhood, happened to be going home from school at a bad time, totally innocent children killed because of gang wars. We see kids going into gangs just to protect themselves because they're afraid if they don't they won't be safe on the street and in their neighborhood. And we have got to break this."", ""We have on the books an antiracketeering statute that had a lot to do with breaking the Mafia. It's called the RICO law. This morning I met with Attorney General Reno at the White House, and she reported that we have more than doubled the number of gang-related prosecutions to nearly 40 percent of all the prosecutions brought under this RICO law this year. These are making a big difference, but they're complicated cases. They take a long time. We're going to have to extend the statute of limitation, to make maximum use of it, from 5 to 10 years. But you know, we give the Government 10 years to make a bank fraud case, it seems to me they ought to have at least that long if an innocent child is gunned down on the street by a gang."", 'Let me just say one other thing. Last week in Colorado I announced a program I\'d like to reiterate. I believe it is very important that we get more States to test prisoners and parolees for drug use and to provide more drug treatment in prisons and to revoke parole if people violate it by using drugs. We have a law on the books which says we will help States build prisons if they promise not to let violent criminals out too soon. I propose to amend it to say, you also have to give drug testing to parolees. That will keep them straight and keep them from returning. Sixty percent of all the heroin and cocaine used in this country—60 percent of all of it—is used by people who are involved with a criminal justice process right now. We need to help them. But more important, we need to protect the rest of our kids and our communities by saying, ""Parole is a privilege, and you can\'t have it if you go back to drugs."" And I hope you will support us in doing that.', ""So that's my program for the future: Do more to break the gangs; ban those cop-killer bullets; drug testing for parolees; improve the opportunities for community-based strategies that lower crime and give our kids something to say yes to. There are a lot of things to do."", ""The final point I want to leave with you is this: These people up here are doing everything they can. And unlike a lot of folks, we have shown—or rather, they have shown, we know how to bring the crime rate down. But they can't do it all by themselves. They need us to support them. I am honored by their support today. And all I can say is, go back to what Senator Glenn said: If you will give us 50 more days, we'll give you 4 more years of making our streets, our homes, our schools safer."", 'Thank you, and God bless you.']"

And I want you to know that, by pure coincidence, I was in Cincinnati, Ohio, with John Glenn yesterday and believe it or not, aboard Air Force One he actually wrote me this letter, which I'm going to give to the high school principal for the school's records when I finish.

I\'ve always been more than grateful that I\'ve been able to participate in some of those events on behalf of this great country of ours.

I want every American, without regard to age, to have the opportunity to live up to his or her potential. To reach that potential, we have to build a bridge to the 21st century we can all walk across.

The United States has just contracted with IBM to build a supercomputer that will do more calculations in one second than you can go home and do on your hand-held calculator in 30,000 years.', 'The young people in this audience today will not only be doing jobs that have not been invented yet, many of you will do work that has not been imagined yet. If we want that kind of world to work for all of us, we have got to build the right kind of bridge, and the foundation, I say again, is education and education for everyone—everyone.', 'To me, this is part of a simple but profound strategy: opportunity for all Americans; responsibility from all Americans; and a community in which every American, without regard to race or gender or income or where you start out in life, who works hard and shows up every day has a fair chance to live out their dreams. That is the strategy we have followed.', ""Folks, it's working pretty well. Compared to 4 years ago, we have the lowest unemployment rate in 7 1/2 years and 10 1/2 million new jobs, 4 1/2 million new homeowners. The deficit has gone down for 4 years in a row for the first time since before the Civil War. The unemployment rate in Michigan has been less than 5 percent every month this year for the first time in a generation. And for the first time since the 1970's, it is the United States that is producing more cars and selling more cars than any other country in the world.

We have to have stronger families. That's why I fought for the family and medical leave law, so you could take a little time off from work for a baby's birth or a parent's illness without losing your job, why I fought to give parents the V-chip to control inappropriate television for their younger children, why I fought against advertising of tobacco to young people. It's illegal in every State in the country, but it happens everywhere."", ""It means stronger communities. That's why I fought for the poorest communities in this country to have empowerment zones. Detroit got one and cut the unemployment by more than half in only 3 years. We can turn the cities around with work, work, work, and education."", ""I now know some things that I didn't know 4 years ago about the American people, and I can tell you I am more optimistic today than I was the day I took the oath of office. I am more idealistic today than I was the day I took the oath of office because I know today from seeing what's happened in the last 4 years there is nothing that you cannot do if you're given the tools to do the job, and that's exactly what I intend to see done."", 'I believed 4 years ago that if we put 100,000 police on the street and gave our police the ability to work with people in community settings, if we got tougher with serious criminals and gave our young people something to say yes to, we could bring the crime rate down. Well, for 4 years in a row, the crime rate has dropped in America. And now, just today, the Justice Department pointed out that last year the crime rate dropped 9 percent, the largest drop in a decade. There are one million fewer victims of crime than there were a year ago. That is a good sign for America.', ""Now, I don't want to hesitate for a minute on this. I'm not declaring victory against crime, I'm just saying we're moving in the right direction. And what we need to do is not to abandon the present course but to bear down and do more of it, more police on the street, more criminals and guns and drugs off the street. We can do that if you will stay the course."", ""We've got to keep this economy growing and strong. That means we have to balance the budget all right, because that keeps interest rates down. That means lower car payments. That means lower home mortgage payments. That means lower credit card payments. That means businesses can borrow money at lower rates to hire more people and raise wages and improve productivity. That's important. But we have to do it in the right way. We don't have to wreck Medicare or Medicaid or turn our backs on education or the environment."", ""We need to invest more money in research and technology to create those high-wage jobs for the future, not less. And we need an aggressive trade policy that opens new markets. One of the proudest moments I've had as President of the United States was going to an automobile showroom in Tokyo and sitting in a car made in the United States of America for sale."", ""But let me say again, my friends, we cannot build that bridge with any of those components unless the foundation is world-class education. We've already done a lot to lower the costs of college loans, create the AmeriCorps program, which has allowed 50,000 young people to go to college and serve in their communities, raising standards, supporting improved Head Start programs and other things, but there is more we have to do."", 'Forty percent of the children in this country can still not read on their own when they are in the third grade.

For those of you like me who don't know a lot about computers, that may not mean much, so let me put it in plain language. Let me tell you what that means. If we hook up every classroom in America to the information superhighway, what it means is this: that in the poorest inner-city classrooms, in the most remote rural classrooms and all the classrooms in between, for the first time in the history of our country, all of our schoolchildren will have access to the same learning at the same level of quality in the same way in the same time as the students in the richest schools in America. That is achievable, and we must do it."", 'I want to make sure that we make at least 2 years of education after high school, in a vocational center, a community college, in a college—at least 2 years after high school—just as universal in 4 years as a high school diploma is today. And we can do that by giving the American people a $1,500 tax credit for the typical cost of community college education, a dollar-for-dollar reduction for the cost of the tuition, and we ought to do it.', 'I believe that we should give families a deduction for the cost of college tuition up to $10,000 for the cost of any education after high school for people of any age—yes, the children but their parents, too, if they need it. We ought to do that.', 'How has the auto industry come back—with greater productivity, smarter technology, and people who are trained to do it. Technology, education, training, hard work, and smart work; it all begins with education.', ""And let me say one of the most important parts of education is making sure that we tear down the artificial wall in every school system in America between what is academic and what is vocational. I just was in that Bill Ford Center and I saw those young students, those young men and women working on those machines. That's vocational work. I wasn't smart enough to do it. I didn't know how to program those machines. It was academic work as well as vocational work. It was mindwork. It was smart work. And that is the work of the 21st century. And we have to support that work in manufacturing, in services, in agriculture, in all forms of endeavor."", ""When I became President, one of the things that really bothered me was that our country was the only advanced economy in the world that didn't have an organized system to make sure that every student—like Lynn Rivers 21 years ago or Brian today—that every student who didn't go on to a college at least had a chance to continue their education by blending school and work. We call it now school-to-work opportunities. And when I was a Governor, I worked hard to improve those opportunities, and as President, we have worked hard to give 26 States, including Michigan, the opportunity to put employers and educators together to build a seamless web of people moving from school to work in the high-wage, high-skilled jobs that can earn them good incomes."", 'This is school-to-work week in America. And today, there are 500,000 students and 105,000 employers and 1,800 schools, including both John Glenn and William Ford schools, that have embraced the school-to-work opportunities our Nation now offers. We have to keep going until every school system in America and every student in America has the opportunities I saw your people having today. They deserve it, and it will build our economy.', 'Brian Duka has a bright future today because of the education he received here and because of the work he\'s doing now. And we have to blend education and work for a lifetime. One of the most important proposals I had that I regret this Congress didn\'t pass that I hope the next one will is to take all these little training programs the Government has and take all the money and put it in a big block, and when someone is unemployed or underemployed, if they\'re qualified for Federal training help, send them a check for $2,500 and say, ""You know where the nearest good training program is. Take your money there, get the training, find yourself a job so that if you lose your job, you can get a better one instead of a worse one.""', 'If we do that for everybody—give everybody a ""GI bill,"" a skills grant that will give them a chance to move from job to job by going up, not going down—we will strengthen America\'s families and strengthen America\'s economy. Education is for everyone of every age who needs it, and we have to give them that.', ""My friends, in 7 weeks from today, you'll get to make a decision about whether to build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past, about whether you believe we're all in this together or to use my wife's term, it takes a village, or whether you think we're on our own. This country always, always, always wins when we put down the things that divide us, when we stop fighting, when we stop being small and we think big and we work together."", ""We have got to build a bridge to the 21st century that every single American can walk across. There is no nation as well-positioned for that century as we are. And all of our diversity— I look out in this crowd today, there are people here today from—I can see at least seven different ethnic groups just looking out here and I'll bet many more. That is a strength for the United States. There is no country as well-positioned as we are for this global economy if we will lay the foundation, and it starts with building that bridge on the finest educational system in the world."", 'Thank you, and God bless you all.

If you give me 4 more years, I hope you'll send Dick Durbin up there to help me in the United States Senate. And if you follow Brendan Cumisky's advice about the pictures, it wouldn't surprise me to see him with his picture up there running for President someday, based on that introduction."", ""Folks, I have followed a very simple strategy that I believe is profoundly important for this country. I want us in the next 4 years to set foot in a new century and a new millennium in which we can say that the American dream is alive and well for every person willing to work for it, in which we can say that the United States is still the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity in the world, and in which we can say, looking around this audience, that we have built an American community that is stronger for our diversity, not being torn apart by it.

Our massive Government deficit of 4 years ago has been cut by 60 percent, and it's gone down in each of the last 4 years, the first time that has happened in a Presidential administration since the 1840's, before the Civil War.

Twenty-five million Americans have been made more secure in their health care because we passed a law that says you cannot lose your health insurance just because somebody in your family has been sick or just because you have to change jobs. You still have a right to keep it, and people have to offer you insurance coverage. And that's very important in this country."", 'We made every small business in this country eligible for a tax cut for their health insurance or if they invest more in their business to hire more people, to become more productive, to grow the economy more.

We've moved 1.8 million people off welfare, but there are still a lot of able-bodied people on welfare who would like to go to work. I signed a welfare reform bill that says we'll keep giving poor families medical care and food and child care if they go to work, but now, if we can find a job, they have to take it. I'm going to challenge every city, every community in this country to give those people the jobs. You don't want to put the children in the street; you want to put the parents to work. This should be a positive, good thing to create a million jobs in America."", ""I want to build a bridge to the 21st century where we bring the crime rate down not for 4 years in a row but for 8 years in a row. That means we have to finish the job of putting 100,000 police on the street. It means that we were right to pass the Brady bill, which has kept 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers from getting handguns. And I believe we ought to expand the Brady bill to say that someone who beats up their spouse or their child should not get a handgun either.

Ten million—I want you to listen to this—10 million American children— 10 million still live within 4 miles of a toxic waste site. Now, in the last 3 years, we have cleaned up more of those sites than were cleaned up by our country in the previous 12 years before I took office. But there are still hundreds of them out there. One of the things I want to do to build that bridge is to take the 500 worst, the two-thirds of those that are left, and clean up 500 in the next 4 years so that we can say our children are growing up next to parks, not poison. That's a part of our bridge to the 21st century as well."", 'But most important of all, we have to build a bridge to the 21st century with the best education system in the world for every single American person, every child. And I believe there are three or four very important things we have to do. Do you know that 40 percent of the 8-year-olds in this country can still not read independently? I want to mobilize an army of reading tutors and specialists to work with our teachers and work at home with parents so that over the next 4 years any 8-year-old in America will be able to pick up a book and smile and say, ""I can read this all by myself."" That is a worthy goal, and we can achieve it if we work for it.', ""I want to make sure that every classroom in America not only has computers and teachers trained to work with the students in how to use them but is also hooked up to the information superhighway, to the Internet, to the World Wide Web.

If we hook up every classroom in America to the information superhighway, what it means is that for the first time in the history of the United States, for the first time in our entire history, every student in every school, rich or poor, urban, rural, or suburban, of whatever background, will have access to the same knowledge in the same time at the same level of quality in the same way as every other student. It has never happened in the history of the country. We can do that for America if we do it."", 'And the last thing I want to say, as you heard Congressman Durbin say that he and I worked our way through schools, and we had student loans. And we were proud to get them and proud to pay them back. And I\'m grateful that my country gave me a chance to borrow the money to go to school, to become a more productive student, and to pay it back. One of the first things that I worked to do when I became President was to improve the student loan program so that we could lower the cost and tell our young people, ""You will always have the option of paying that loan as a percentage of your income. We\'re going to change the repayment so that you will not go bankrupt even if you have a huge debt, because you can\'t be charged more in any year than a certain percentage of your income."" Over a million students in Illinois alone are eligible for that loan program today, and I\'m proud of that.', ""Fifty thousand young Americans can now work their way through college by serving in their communities because of the AmeriCorps program, and I'm proud of that. But I want to do more. I want to do some things that literally will revolutionize opportunity in America. And let me just mention three of them."", 'Number one, I want us to make at least 2 years of college just as universal as the high school diploma is now by the year 2000. Will you help me do that? [Applause] That is not hard to do.', 'Here\'s how we can do that. If we give American families a tax credit, a dollar-for-dollar reduction of their taxes, for the cost of tuition at the typical community college in America, then we can literally say, ""If you\'ll go, make good grades, work hard, you can take the money for the tuition off your taxes, and everybody can get at least 2 years of education after high school."" Will you help me build that kind of bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', 'The second thing I want to do is to say that we ought to have a deduction for the cost of college tuition up to $10,000 a year for any college cost—4 years of undergraduate, graduate, you name it—for kids or adults no matter what age. That will help us build a stronger country. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', ""And finally, we propose to make more Americans—American families with family incomes of up to $100,000 eligible to save through IRA's, and then let families withdraw from those IRA's to pay the cost of college or a health emergency or for a first-time home downpayment without any tax penalty, so that people can do more to save for their own college. If you save the money without tax payments and you can get a deduction for investing it, we will literally never tax the money people save for their own college education or their children's college education. It would be the best investment this country ever made. And we can do it and still balance the budget in the right way. Will you help me do that? [Applause]"", ""Folks, I look at this community, I look at this school, I remember everything I've read about it. I saw that Air Force colonel bragging on you. I know you sent student volunteers to work in the White House. I think of all the things you have done and built here, and it looks to me like a pretty good picture of what America ought to be like as we start the 21st century."", 'And I say to you that 7 weeks from today the American people will elect the last President of the 20th century and the first President of the 21st century. But far more important, the American people will decide whether we\'re going to be a country that says, ""It takes a village to raise a child and a community to build a school,"" or ""You\'re on your own,"" whether we\'re going to be a country that says, ""We should try to build a bridge to a distant past,"" or ""No, thank you, we\'re going to build a bridge to a bright new future.""', ""If you want to build a bridge to that bright new future, if you want us all to go over it together, if you believe we have an obligation to help one another make the most of our own lives and you like where we've come from compared to where we were, I hope that you will stand fast for education, for opportunity for every single American, and for working to build that bridge that we can all walk across together because our best days are still ahead."", 'Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you.']"

I also have a Seattle Fire Department cap that's keeping me a little dry here."", ""I want to thank Congressman Norm Dicks, who's up here.

He will be a great partner, and I will work with him to make this State even greater. Thank you for everything you have done to support him, and stay with him until November.', ""My fellow Americans, I'm glad to see you here. I knew you wouldn't be deterred by the rain, but when the Secret Service told me that 30,000 people had gone through the mags, I knew that you wanted to keep America on the right track to the 21st century."", 'We are moving in the right direction. And I am proud of the fact that since I came here 4 years ago and asked you to support me in meeting our challenges, protecting our values, providing opportunity and responsibility for all Americans, and bringing this country together, not seeing it driven apart, having us relish our diversity instead of being destroyed by it, we are moving ahead.', ""We have 10 1/2 million more jobs than we had 4 years ago. We've cut the deficit by 60 percent, the first time since before the Civil War it's gone down all 4 years in a row. On October 1st 10 million Americans will get an increase in their minimum wage, thanks to the leadership of the Democratic Party. Twenty-five million Americans are now going to have a chance to keep their health insurance or get it because of the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that says no more can you be denied health insurance because you changed jobs or just because someone in your family has been sick. And it's high time we did that for the American people."", 'The crime rate has come down for 4 years in a row. We just got a report a couple of days ago that there are one million fewer victims of crime than there were. Our crime approach is working. The Democrats were right to push it. More police, take the assault weapons off the street, enforce the Brady bill, give our kids something to say yes to, ""three strikes and you\'re out:"" it\'s working, and we need to continue to support it.', ""There are 1.8 million fewer people on the welfare rolls; child support collections are up 40 percent. We have improved the safety of our drinking water, our air, our food. We are protecting the natural heritage of this country. And I'm very proud that just today I was in the Grand Canyon, announcing the creation in Utah of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument of 1.7 million acres."", 'I am very proud that this week we had an agreement to protect and restore salmon to the Columbia River. And I am especially, especially proud that just last night we reached an agreement, and high time, to protect the old-growth timber in Washington and Oregon. We are moving in the right direction.', ""Washington is the most trade-dependent State in the country, and I am very proud of the fact that we have concluded over 200 trade agreements. We are now exporting everything from high-tech equipment to airplanes to, yes, even Washington apples around the world in the last 4 years. And we did it by replacing the old Washington politics of personal destruction and who is to blame with a new question, not who's to blame, not who we can bad-mouth, but what are we going to do to make this country a greater place for every single American who is willing to work for it."", ""In the two conventions of the great parties held this summer the issue before the American people was posed squarely and clearly: Are we going to build a bridge to the past or a bridge to the future? Do we believe that Government is our enemy, and we should be on our own, or do we believe that the First Lady is right: It takes a village, and we're going into the future together."", 'Rain or shine, I came here to ask you, will you help me build the bridge to the 21st century? [Applause] I want to build a bridge to the 21st century where every American has a chance to reap the bounty of America, starting with the finest education system in the world for everyone. Forty percent of our 8-year-olds can\'t read on their own. In the next 4 years I want an army of reading volunteers and trained tutors to go into our families and into our schools and help our parents and our teachers, so that by the year 2000 every single third grader in this country can hold up a book and say, ""I read it all by myself."" I want you to help me do that.', 'In this great high-tech home, I want us to make sure that every classroom in America not only has the computers they need, not only has the teachers trained to help the students with the computers, but is hooked up to the information superhighway so that we can say for the first time in the entire history of the United States, every child in every classroom from the poorest inner cities to the most remote mountain villages has access to the same learning at the same quality in the same time as every single child in the United States.', 'And finally, on education, we have to open the doors of college education to all Americans. I want to make in the next 4 years at least 2 years of college just as universal in the United States as a high school diploma is today. That is the way to move this country forward. I want to give a tax cut for the cost of a typical community college education, dollar for dollar, to every American who will go to community college and do a good job of any age, so that everybody can say, ""No matter what happens to me, I can always go back and get the education I need to move up, not down in this competitive global economy.""', 'And I want to give every family a deduction for the cost of college tuition of up to $10,000 a year for any kind of college cost. It would build America. It would help us grow together. It will move us forward. It will build that bridge.', ""Ladies and gentlemen, I want to keep this economy going: more trade, more trade opportunities, more investment in research. Yes, a balanced budget, but let's balance the budget without wrecking Medicare, turning our backs on Medicaid's commitment to families with disabilities or children that are poor or women that are pregnant or the elderly who need our help. And I want to continue to invest in the environment and education, not turn our backs on it. And I want you to think about that when you vote in Norm Dicks' election and all these other races for Congress."", 'In 1994 the other party came to Washington, and they said, ""Help us make a revolution. We\'re going to revolutionize America."" Well, we saw what their revolution was. ""You take our cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment. You let us raise taxes on the 9 million poorest working people in America. Let us raid pension funds. Let us let polluters write their own environment laws, or we\'ll shut the Government down."" I told them to shut the Government down. Norm Dicks stood with me, and we stopped what they were trying to do.', ""And ladies and gentlemen, never forget— never forget—what stake you have. The University of Washington is the number one—the number one—public institution of higher education in America in the receipt of national research funds. This is important to our future. I just signed—we just signed an agreement— I didn't actually have to sign the agreement myself—but we just made an agreement, my administration and IBM, to build a supercomputer over the next couple of years that will do— listen to this—will do more calculations in one second than you can go home and pick up your hand-held calculator and do in 30,000 years."", ""We are going to keep this country on the cutting edge of technology if you will give the American people and the people of Washington, yourselves and your children, a United States Congress that understands we have to invest in research and education and the environment if we're going to grow this country. And we can balance the budget and do that. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", ""I want to build a bridge to the 21st century where everybody has a chance to be responsible—1.8 million fewer people on welfare, moving from welfare to work. Here's what that new law says—and this is another reason you need Gary Locke as Governor—the new welfare reform law says this: We will continue the national guarantee of health care and nutrition to people who are poor and on welfare. If they go to work, we'll spend more than ever on child care so they don't have to hurt their kids. But we're going to take the welfare check and give that money to the States so they can decide how both to support people and move them, those who are able-bodied, into the workplace within 2 years."", ""Now, who do you trust to do right by the poor people of Washington and bring them into the mainstream? Gary Locke. I'm committed to helping him and the city of Seattle and other cities in this country create a million new jobs for those people in the next 4 years. I want you to help us both build that kind of bridge to the 21st century."", ""And finally, you know, our friends on the other side, they talk a lot about crime. They talked tough about crime for 6 years but nothing ever happened. We passed the 1994 crime bill. And they came into the State of Washington like a tornado into the rural areas telling all these people how terrible we were, how we were going to take their guns away from them and abolish their right to keep and bear arms. And there was a great revolution here in '94 in the congressional races."", ""Well, guess what? Unfortunately for them, we've had two hunting seasons since then, and not a single hunter in Washington has lost a rifle. But we did take 19 kinds of assault weapons off the street and 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers could not get handguns because of the Brady bill. We were right. They were wrong. You are safer. The crime rate's going down. Let them know about it in November and help us build a bridge to the 21st century where we're all safe."", 'We ought to extend the Brady bill and say, ""If you beat up your spouse or your child, you shouldn\'t be able to get a handgun either."" If police put their lives on the lines for us, we ought to say we haven\'t seen any game wearing bulletproof vests. We want to ban those copkiller bullets. And those who are opposed to us are wrong. Let\'s ban them, get rid of them, make our police officers safer and our streets safer.', 'We ought to build a bridge to the 21st century that brings us together as a community, beginning with strong families. You know what I hear all over America as the number one family problem? ""How can I reconcile the demands of work and rearing my children? How can I do this? I need some help."" That\'s why I\'m very proud that the first bill I signed, over the opposition of the leaders of the other party, was the family and medical leave law.', 'And since then, 12 million times families have taken advantage of that law when a baby was born or a parent was sick so they could take care of their families without losing their jobs. And what have we got to show for it: 10 1/2 million new jobs, the lowest unemployment rate in 7 years, record numbers of new small businesses. We are moving this country in the right direction.', ""We can help small business the way we have, make it easier for people to take out pensions and take them from job to job, give all small businesses a tax cut as we have when they invest more in their businesses. But don't ask people to hurt their families."", ""I want to expand family and medical leave to give people some time off to go to doctor's appointments and parent-teacher conferences at the schools so people can raise their kids and succeed at work. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'And let me say, finally, we have got to build a bridge to the 21st century as everybody in Washington State knows that enables us to grow the economy while preserving our environment. We are working to save our natural treasures, from the Grand Staircase-Escalante, which I mentioned, to getting the gold mine out of the reaches of Yellowstone National Park, to saving the Everglades all the way across the country in Florida, to improving the quality of our air, the safety of our drinking water, the safety of our food. And we have more to do.', ""We've cleaned up more toxic waste sites in 3 years than the previous administrations did in 12. But we still have a long way to go: 10 million of our children still live within 4 miles of a toxic waste dump. If you'll give us 4 more years, we'll clean up 500 more so children will grow up next to parks, not poison. That's the way to build a bridge to the 21st century, and I want you to help me do it."", 'And finally, let me say this: We have to build a good community in America and be a part of a strong community in the world. I spend so much of the time you have given me to be President trying to deal with the new security challenges of this era, trying to combat the terrorists, trying to combat the ethnic hatred, trying to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction, not just nuclear weapons but biological and chemical weapons and other sophisticated weapons, trying to beat the drug runners and the organized criminals so that we can have a world that is open and free, where people can move around and share information but our children will be safe.', 'If you think about it, a lot of the time I spend is dealing with problems that are caused because people refuse to get along with each other and behave like sensible adults because people all over this world insist on looking down on others because they\'re of a different race, a different religion, a different ethnic group, a different tribe, or in same other way different from them. People insist on saying, ""I\'m important because I\'m not you.""', 'Well, Seattle is a rebuke to that. Seattle is a place where everybody has a home. You look around this crowd today, look around this crowd today. There are 197 nations represented in the Olympics and a whole lot of them are represented in this crowd of 30,000 in Seattle, Washington, United States of America today.', ""That's the world I want to live in. That's the country I want to live in. We cannot afford— we cannot afford—politicians who are waging war on legal immigrants for their own benefits. We cannot afford this church burning. We cannot afford the kinds of hatreds and wedge issues that have been too much a staple of our politics in modern time."", 'Think about the rest of the world. There is no country—no country—as well-positioned as the United States for the 21st century. But we have to make a decision. Are we all part of one village? Do we want to say, ""You\'re on your own?"" Do we really believe that we\'re all created equal in the eyes of God, or do we need to have somebody to look down on so we can feel important? I think you know the answer to that.', 'I think we ought to build a bridge to the 21st century that is wide and strong so that we can say to anybody we run across, any man or woman, boy or girl without regard to anything else, ""All you have to do is believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, show up for work tomorrow or for school, do your best, obey the law, love your neighbor as yourself, and you\'re part of our community and we\'re willing to walk with you into the future.""

And we need your help."", ""You know, if you look around, if you just look around Seattle today and the State of Washington, you see a lot of living examples of what I am trying so hard to do for America's future. You know, I want to build a bridge to the future that has a growing economy in which everybody can participate, not just a few but everybody. That's why it's important to stop those who tried to cut back on education and instead make a college education available to everybody, bring the Internet to every classroom, make sure we have world-class opportunities."", ""I want us to go forward as one community building for the future. That's why it's important to balance the budget without walking away from our commitments to education or to the environment or to research. As I said today at the Pike Street Market, the University of Washington is the number one recipient of Federal research investment of any public university in the United States of America. You've got a big stake in our continuing to invest in the future and building a better future."", ""Just in the last 4 years, I've seen the life expectancy of people with HIV and AIDS more than double in 4 years because of medical research and accelerating movement of drugs to the marketplace. Just a few days before Christopher Reeve spoke so movingly at the Democratic National Convention about research—just a few days—for the first time in history we had an example of lower-limb movement being restored to laboratory animals that had their spines severed by nerve transplants. This is historic in its implications. To turn away from research at the time when things like this are happening is folly."", ""So, yes, balance the budget, but keep investing in our people and our future so we can go forward together and grow together. You understand that here. You know that here. You know it's a part of our future, and you have to stand for it."", ""This has also been a great week for America's natural heritage and environment. Last night we reached an agreement to preserve the oldgrowth forests in Washington and Oregon. This week we reached an agreement to preserve and restore salmon on the Columbia River, very important. Today I went to the Grand Canyon, which was first preserved by Theodore Roosevelt in 1908 by a declaration of Presidential monument, to declare a monument in southern Utah, 1.7 million acres, the Grand Cascade-Escalante monument. It's a beautiful, priceless treasure for our people and a great thing for our country."", ""But we have more to do. There is a huge difference here. One party wants to build a bridge to the future; one says we should reach back and build a bridge to the past. One approach says the Government is always the problem; we'd be better off if we were on our own. My approach says—I agree with my wife's book; it takes a village to raise a child, to grow the country, to build a future."", ""And there is no community in America more outward-looking, more reaching out to the world, more relishing of its diversity than Seattle. And the way you live every day trying to reconcile your differences and appreciate your differences and relish them and build strength out of this community, that's what America has to do."", ""When Hillary and our daughter and I went to the Olympics to open them and I got to talk to the American team, it occurred to me that if the American team were to take off its uniforms and just walk around in the Olympic Village, you wouldn't have a clue where they were from. I mean we had Hispanic-Americans and we had Nordic-Americans and we had Indian- and Pakistani-Americans and we had Native Americans and we had all kinds of Asian-Americans from all over."", 'Audience member. Gay Americans!', ""The President. Yes. We had everybody and all on the Olympic team. So it occurred to me that—and I sat in the Olympic dining hall there, and I ate with these various team members and people came up to me from Ireland and from the Middle East and from various places where I've been working to try to make peace and thanked me for the efforts of the United States. And I thought to myself—I thought to myself, here we got 197 different national groups represented at the Olympics. Our largest county, Los Angeles County, has people from over 150 of those places in one county. In Seattle, you have nearly that many. And yet we're still somehow making it work."", ""But that's still our biggest challenge. You think about the time I spend as your President trying to get other people around the world to get along instead of look down on each other."", ""That's the last thing I will say. This is a better country in terms of our achievements, our direction, and our opportunity, our sense of civic responsibility; we're stronger, we're in better shape than we were 4 years ago. By any measure, we're in better shape than we were 4 years ago."", ""But if you really want to build a bridge to the 21st century, if you want to feel on a daily basis about your country the energy, the elation, the joy you are manifesting here tonight, you know as well as I do that we have to make opportunity available to everyone. We have to give everyone a chance and expect everyone to play the role of responsible citizen. And we have got to find a way to convince everybody who hasn't got it yet that we are stronger, not weaker, because of our diversity. It is our meal ticket to the future. It is our meal ticket to the future. There is not a country in the world as wellpositioned for the 21st century as the United States."", 'Audience member. You know it!', ""The President. Nobody. Because of the way we're connected to the rest of the world, because of what we're doing with technology, because of our commitment to educate all of our children, because of the entrepreneurial spirit we have. But the great test is, are we going to be one community? Are we going to make a strength out of what is bedeviling so much of the rest of the world?"", ""It breaks my heart to think that there are people in the Middle East that want to keep the war going. It breaks my heart to see that the peace in Ireland was broken by people who would rather fight about something that happened 300 or 600 years ago instead of letting all the Catholic and Protestant kids go forward into the future together. It's amazing to me that in Bosnia, where they lived together in peace for decades, within a matter of months they started a 4-year war where they were killing each other's kids."", ""That's why I overreact, by some standards, when we do things like have church burnings here or synagogues are defaced or Islamic centers are destroyed. This is a country which rests on a simple premise. We have never lived up to it perfectly, but we're getting better at it all along, which is why we're still around here after 220 years. And that simple premise is, everybody is equal in the eyes of God. If you want to be an American, what you have to do is believe in the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and the Constitution and show up and behave yourself and do right, and you're part of our country, and you'll be on that bridge to the 21st century.

Send Adam Smith and Jeff Coopersmith to the Congress, and give Norm Dicks some help to move you forward and our country forward into the next century."", 'And thank you, Gary Locke, for your distinguished career in public service, for the fine and positive campaign you have run for Governor of the State of Washington. I want all of you to do what you can in the next few weeks to make sure that this fine man is the next Governor. It is very important to your future, more and more responsibilities are devolving upon the State. The next Governor of Washington will, among other things, have the responsibility of working with local communities to create an unprecedented number of new jobs for people we are trying to move from welfare to work in a way that supports families and supports children and does not walk away from our responsibilities to them. I think you know who will do a better job of that, and I hope you will help him win this election.', ""I want to thank the other officials who are here, but most of all, I want to tell you that you can't imagine what it's like to pull up in a bus and see 28,000 people in the morning, in Tacoma, standing in the rain. That's because you know that America is on the right track to the 21st century, and we intend to keep it on that track, and I want you to help us."", ""I have said before, let me say again: We are living at a moment of enormous possibility. The young people in this audience will have more chances to live out their dreams than any generation of Americans in history if—if—we build a bridge to the 21st century that opens opportunity for all, expects responsibility from all, and is big enough, broad enough, and strong enough for every American who is willing to work for it to go across, arm in arm, without regard to race or gender or income, or where you start out in life or condition of disability. Everybody should be able to go across the American bridge to the 21st century, and that's what I'm asking you to help us build."", 'My fellow Americans, there is a reason that the economy is better than it was 4 years ago. There is a reason the crime rate has gone down for 4 years in a row. There is a reason that the welfare rolls have gone down and the child support collections have gone up. There is a reason that the air is cleaner, our drinking water is protected, our food is going to be safer. There is a reason that the toxic waste dumps that we cleaned up in the last 3 years were greater than those cleaned up in the 12 years before we took office. There is a reason that we were able to declare the Grand Cascade-Escalante national monument in southern Utah yesterday, 1.7 million acres, to save Yellowstone from a gold mine, to reach a historic agreement here in Washington State just 2 days ago to protect the old-growth forests of Washington and Oregon, to reach an agreement to restore the salmon in the Columbia River. This does not happen by accident. This happened because we replaced the old Washington politics of who can we blame and hot air with ""What are we going to do about it?"" Let\'s don\'t talk, let\'s roll up our sleeves, join hands, and actually do something to help the American people make the most of their own lives and to move forward, and that is what we proposed to do.', ""So I come here to Tacoma to ask you to help me build a bridge to the 21st century. A bridge that focuses first and foremost on making sure that every American has the chance to make the most of his or her own life, and that means world-class education. A bridge to the 21st century where, as the Vice President said, we hook up every classroom and every library and every school in the United States to the information superhighway, to the Internet, to the World Wide Web, that we give all of our children, for the first time in history, whether they're in the poorest urban districts, the most remote mountain districts—every single child at the first time in history will have access to the same information in the same time at the same quality as the children in the richest schools of America. We have never done it before, we can do it now. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", ""I want to build a bridge to the 21st century where college is available to every American of any age who needs to go. We propose, first, to say people can save more in their individual retirement accounts, their IRA's, and then withdraw from it, tax-free, to pay for a college education. Second, that we want at least 2 years of education after high school by the year 2000 to be just as universal as a high school diploma is today, and we propose to guarantee it by giving people a tax credit, a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the taxes for the typical costs of community college tuition in this country. And third, that we propose to give a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year for the costs of any college tuition—undergraduate, graduate, for people who are young or middle-aged or old. Let's do that and build a bridge we can all walk across to the 21st century. Will you help us build that bridge?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. The second thing we have to do is to keep this economy growing. That means we do have to continue to bring the deficit down and balance the budget, because that means low interest rates, lower car payments, mortgage payments, lower payments for businesses who have to borrow money to create jobs, lower home payments. But we have to do it in a way that honors our obligations to each other and to our future. We don't have to wreck Medicare, turn our backs on Medicaid's responsibility to poor children, pregnant women, the elderly, families with members with disabilities. We do not have to gut the environment or reduce our investments in education and medical research and other research in technology areas."", ""Let me tell you, folks, Washington State has led the way in reaching out to the rest of the world with exports and in developing a diversified, high-tech economy. I'm very proud of the fact that, in this administration, we've concluded 200 trade agreements that's helped the people in Washington export everything from computer software, to airplanes, to Washington apples. I am proud of that. But we have to continue."", 'The University of Washington is the number one receiver of Federal research money of any public university in the United States. We have to continue to invest there. And we also have to continue to invest in other forms of research and technology.', ""And today let me just say a special word about our space program. I expect most of you, like me, were thrilled to see the stunning pictures from space that came out early this morning as our Space Shuttle Atlantis linked up with the Russian Space Station Mir. Our American hero, Shannon Lucid, greeted her American colleagues. What a wonderful person she seems to be. It's so impressive, the life that she's lived. We need to support that space exploration. And I want to tell you that today our administration will announce the results of a complete review of our space policy, the first new space policy since the end of the cold war."", ""Let me tell you what we're going to do. First, we're going to continue to expand our knowledge of the universe. In December we're going to launch a long-planned robotic mission to the surface of Mars. And believe it or not, if you've seen the movie, it lands on Independence Day, 1997. We thought we would go visit them first and try to get around that blowing up the Capitol and the White House business. [Laughter] This will help us to determine whether and how and when we should send human missions there."", ""The second thing we're going to do, which is very important to the high-tech industries of the Pacific Northwest, is to tear down the barriers that block the development of our space industry. Boeing recently announced an innovative proposal to work with Russia, Ukraine, and Norway to launch satellites at sea. We're going to continue to move forward. We want to have free and fair trade among economies in space, and we can do that."", ""The third thing we're going to do is to make sure we use space to protect our national security, to maintain our freedom of movement, to monitor threats in compliance with our arms control treaties. All of this is very important, and I want to say a special word of thanks to the Vice President for his leadership in space and for the environment, in technology, and for reinventing Government; but especially today, to continue our leading role in space."", 'Now, folks, there is this huge debate going on in the country today, and I have to say that we need to be sensitive to the real issues here. If you look at the budget, if you look at the education issue, if you look at the space issue, there\'s a huge debate: Are we going to build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past? Do we believe we have to work together to give each other the tools to make the most of our own lives, to build strong careers, strong families, strong communities, and a strong country? Or should we say, ""You\'re on your own""?', 'I think I know what you believe. I think you believe the First Lady was right: It does take a village to raise a child, to build a community, to move a country forward.', 'Let me say again, I want you to help Governor-to-be Locke, and support us in building a bridge to the 21st century where we say to people who are going to be moved from welfare to work, we want to help you and support you to raise your children and to succeed at work, because that is what we want for all American families. And I have a plan to create a million new jobs to help move people from welfare to work. I want you to help me build that bridge to the 21st century.', ""I want you to support—the mayor mentioned it earlier—the other big factor in the '94 elections that helped our friends in the opposition win so many seats here in Washington and throughout the country was their relentless assault on our anticrime legislation. They said it was just designed to take your guns away. They said that we had threatened the rights of hunters in Washington, and sports men and women in Washington State and in my home State of Arkansas, to hunt and to engage in other activities, and we weren't going to do anything to fight crime. And they scared a lot of people into voting for them in Washington and other places."", ""But they have a big problem in 1996. We've had two hunting seasons come and go since the last election, and there's not a single hunter in Washington State who is not still hunting with the same weapon he had in 1994. They didn't tell them the truth."", ""But we did take 19 deadly assault weapons off the street, and there were some people who couldn't get guns. Sixty thousand felons, fugitives, and stalkers could not get handguns because of the Brady bill. We were right; they were wrong. Send them a message in these races. Send them a message. And by the way, I believe we ought to extend the Brady bill. I don't believe people who beat up their spouses or their children should be able to get handguns either."", ""I want to build a bridge to the 21st century that we can all walk across together. We ought to be supporting our families. Hillary and Tipper and the Vice President and I, in our different ways, we've tried hard to help families raise their kids and succeed at work. We've worked hard to protect our children from the dangers of advertising, distribution, and sales of tobacco. We've worked hard to increase safe and drugfree schools programs, to support people at the community level who are doing everything they can to keep our young people out of trouble."", ""We've worked hard with the entertainment industry to put the V-chip in televisions and to get TV programs rated, and to bring more educational programming back to primetime television. We are working hard for the family and medical leave law, which has now given 12 million American families the chance to take a little time off from work for the birth of a baby or a parent's illness without losing their jobs. These are important. And if you give us 4 more years we want to expand family and medical leave to say you can have a little time off to go to a regular parent-teacher appointment or a regular doctor's appointment with your children and still keep your job. It's been good for the economy. We have record numbers of new businesses, over 10 million jobs. It's good for America when people can succeed in taking care of their family members and succeed at work."", ""And finally, let me say, we have to continue our work to preserve our environment. There are still 10 million American children who live within 4 miles of a toxic waste dump. If you give us 4 more years we'll close 500 more so our kids will be growing up next to parks, not poison. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? Will you ignore the rain for 6 more weeks and 5 more days and ask your friends and neighbors to support us and to build a bridge to the future?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President.

And so they've got a little microphone over there, and I want us to listen to their song. These kids have done so much work, I think we should listen to them and give them a little support."", ""Let me also tell you that I am delighted to be here. I thank you for your warm welcome. I cannot believe the size of this crowd. What's the population of this community? Two thousand?"", 'Audience member. Two people.', 'The President. No, not two people—I know that.

Now I feel like you've finally taken me in as one of your own now that it's raining on me like it rains on you all the time. And I thank you."", 'Four years ago we came to Washington State and asked you to support our efforts to change this country. We asked you to take us on faith. We said that we could bring hope back to America, that history was giving us a remarkable opportunity to change this country for the better, that we did not have to put up with the conditions as they were, high unemployment, stagnant growth, stagnant wages, rising crime, a dividing country, a more cynical country.', ""And I can tell you that after 4 years this country is in better shape than it was 4 years ago. We are on the right track to the 21st century. Ten and a half million more Americans have jobs; 4 1/2 million more Americans have their own homes; 12 million Americans have been able to take some time off from work without losing their jobs when a baby was born or a parent was sick because of the family leave law; 10 million Americans will get an increase in their pay on October 1st, when the minimum wage law goes into effect; 25 million Americans will have a chance to keep their health insurance because of the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that says you can't have your health insurance jerked or denied because someone in your family has been sick or because you changed jobs. This country is moving in the right direction."", ""The Government's deficit has been cut by 60 percent. It's gone down 4 years in a row for the first time since before the Civil War. The crime rate has gone down for 4 years in a row. The welfare rolls have been reduced by 1.8 million. Child support collections have been increased by 40 percent—$3 billion. And there are one million fewer crime victims than there were last year. We are moving in the right direction toward the 21st century."", 'And I want to ask you to help America make the right decision between building a bridge to the future and reaching back to build a bridge to the past, between saying that ""you\'re on your own and we hope you do fine, the Government\'s always your enemy,"" and saying ""it takes a village—yes, the First Lady is right—it does take a village to raise our children, to build strong communities, to build strong businesses, to build a strong country.

I want you to help me mobilize an army of reading tutors to go out and help parents and schools, to make sure that we change the conditions that exist today where 40 percent of the 8-year-olds in this country cannot read independently. In the year 2000 I want us to be able to say any 8-yearold in America can take out a book and say, ""I can read this all by myself."" And we can do that.', 'I want us to make a commitment that we will hook up every classroom and every library in every school in the United States to the information superhighway, to the Internet, to the World Wide Web, so that children can say, ""No matter whether we live in small towns or big cities, whether our districts are rich, middle class, or poor, for the first time in history we all have access to the same information at the same time in the same way.

I want you to help me do that.', 'I want us to be able to say that we have opened the doors of college education to every single person who is willing to work hard and do well—every American without regard to age or income should be able to go. How are we going to do that? Let people save through an IRA and then withdraw without penalty to spend it on a college education. Make the first 2 years of college in a community college as universal in 4 years as a high school diploma is today by saying you can take off the cost of the typical community college tuition right off your tax bill, dollar for dollar—a tax credit to educate people for 2 years. Finally, give people a $10,000 tax deduction for the cost of all college tuition. That will build this country; it will strengthen us; it will open opportunity for everybody. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', ""The second thing we have to do, folks, is keep this economy growing strong. I want to have the right kind of tax cut, one that is targeted to education, to childrearing, to health care costs, to buying the first-time home; we're not imposing taxes on people if they sell their home for a gain. But I want these things paid for because we still have to balance the budget without bankrupting Medicare, Medicaid, or turning our backs on education and the environment. We have to invest in our future and honor our obligations to the people that share this country with us. And I want you to help me build that kind of bridge to the 21st century. I hope you will do that."", ""I want you to help me build a bridge to the 21st century where we move people from welfare to work and every able-bodied person now on welfare is working.

Well, 10 1/2 million jobs later, we know he was wrong. We've got the lowest unemployment rate in 7 1/2 years."", ""He said their contract on America would make a better place.

When we said no to that, you knew that there was no revolution, that it was a reaction.

Then they said in the area of crime, ""We\'re going to be tougher on crime."" But what did they try to do? What did they try to do? They tried to turn back on our commitment to put 100,000 police on the street. They tried to destroy our safe and drug-free schools program. They tried to eliminate the things that poor kids can say yes to like summer jobs. They opposed the assault weapons ban.', ""And they told you that the Brady bill was going to take guns away from Washington hunters. Well, guess what, folks. It's been 2 years, and we've got some friends in the loyal opposition here in the crowd, and I welcome them here. I'm glad they're here. But we ought to ask them, when you told people to elect all these Congressmen in Washington, that these guys were going to lose their guns, how come we've been through two hunting seasons and all the Washington hunters still have their guns but the crime rate has gone down?"", ""I'll tell you who doesn't have guns, the 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers who couldn't get handguns because of the Brady bill. This is a safer country in the last 4 years because of our crime program, and they fought it."", ""I want you to help us build a bridge to the 21st century with strong families and strong, clean communities. I am proud of the fact that we passed the family leave law, but I think people should be able to get a little time off from work to go to those regular appointments with their children's teachers or to take their parents to the doctor on a regular basis. That won't bankrupt the economy. It will make us stronger. I ask you to help me build a country with stronger families."", ""I want you to help me see through our efforts to stop the tobacco companies from selling tobacco and marketing it to our children.

We reached an agreement to restore the salmon on the Columbia River in ways that will help the economy and preserve our natural heritage. Yesterday we preserved 1.7 million acres in southern Utah, the Cascade-Escalante national monument. It's important."", ""We are going to have cleaner air, safer drinking water, purer food, because this administration believes that we don't have to roll back 25 years of bipartisan commitment to environmental protection; we should build on it."", 'Folks, we can grow the economy of Washington State by preserving the environment in a smart way. And so I ask you—let me just give you one example. We\'ve cleaned up more toxic dumps in 3 years than were cleaned up in 12 years before us.

If you will give us 4 more years, we\'ll clean up 500 more, and we can say, ""Our kids in America, they\'re growing up next to parks, not poison.""

It's about what these children will have in America when they are our age. It's about what we will be like when we charge into the 21st century. It's about whether we're going forward with opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and a sense of community in this country that says, if you believe in the principles of the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Bill of Rights, if you're willing to work hard and be responsible, we're going to build a bridge to the 21st century that you can walk across with us, hand in hand, arm in arm.

Thank you, sir."", ""And thank you, Gary Locke, not only for running for Governor but for the good, positive, constructive, progressive, future-oriented campaign that you ran and that you will run. Ladies and gentlemen, the partnership between the National Government and the States is critical and will be more critical in the next few years. We're reforming the welfare laws, for example, and giving the States the power to design programs for able-bodied people on welfare to have to work in return for support for their children. You want people who care about those kids, who want to bring those folks into the mainstream, who have both compassion as well as a strong work ethic. I think you know who should be the next Governor of the State of Washington, Gary Locke."", 'Let me also say a special word of thanks to the Vice President for what he said about the fight we had last year with the leaders of Congress—with Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole and those who were committed to their Contract With America. I remember well in 1994 when they went across the country and they won the Congress back. They won as many seats in the State of Washington, including this one, as in any State in the country. And they said a few clear things. They said, ""We have this Contract With America, and it will move America forward."" They neglected to say they wanted to cut education, they wanted to weaken the environment, they wanted to raise taxes on the poorest working people, they wanted to permit people to raid their workers\' pension funds, they wanted to abolish AmeriCorps, abolish our student loan program, abolish the safe and drugfree schools program. They wanted to turn Medicare into a two-tier system. They wanted to stop Medicaid\'s guarantee of health care to poor children, to pregnant women, to families with people with disabilities, to the elderly in our nursing homes. They left out all that fine print in 1994.', ""But when they took office we saw what they wanted. They also attacked us for two things. They said the economic program which passed in 1993 raised the taxes of ordinary Americans, their income taxes. It wasn't true. They said that the crime bill of 1994 was going to take guns away from the hunters and sportsmen of Washington. And guess what, that wasn't true."", ""Well, now you've had 2 years to see them and to see the results of our efforts. And what I want to say to you is the country is going to be looking at Washington State because the voters of Washington State, by the narrowest of margins in five congressional districts, bought on to Mr. Gingrich's and Mr. Dole's Contract With America. And now you have seen the results. First of all, what they told you about our program was wrong. We have 10 1/2 million more jobs; they were wrong. The deficit has gone down, not up; they were wrong."", ""You've seen our crime bill. The crime rate has gone down for 4 years in a row. We're putting 100,000 police on the street. Not a single Washington hunter has lost a weapon in 2 years. They did not tell the rural people of Washington the truth. But 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers couldn't get guns because of the Brady bill. We were right, and they were wrong."", ""And in pursuit of their contract, they shut the Government down when we pleaded with them to balance the budget in a humane way. We said, we're for balancing the budget. After all, we brought the deficit down, and all of you voted against us. But we don't want to destroy Medicare or Medicaid or cut education or turn our backs on our commitment to the environment. We can't raise taxes on the poorest working people in America. We can't allow a raid on our pension funds. We went through that in the 1980's, and I saw too many people have their retirement taken away. Let's just balance the budget. We've got the agreed-upon savings. And they said no; they shut the Government down."", ""Now, folks, right here in Centralia you're going to be looked to all over America.

Did they really vote to end the safe and drugfree school program? Did they really vote to deprive these fine young people here of the opportunity to earn their way through college by serving their communities in the AmeriCorps program?"", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', 'The President. Did they really vote to end our new college loan program, which is lower cost and gives children better repayment options so that no one need fear going to school because of the debt?

This election will see the American people elect the last President of the 20th century and the first President of the 21st century. At a time of enormous change in how we work and live and relate to the rest of the world, just think of it: Here we are in a beautiful, traditional American town, a great Main Street here, in a State where one in five jobs is dependent upon our ability to trade with people all around the world. This is a new age.', ""Let me tell you, to the young people here— there are young people in this audience who will soon be doing jobs that have not been invented yet. Many of them will do jobs that have not been imagined yet. You will see miraculous medical discoveries. I'm so glad we have this section here for our friends who have come in wheelchairs. Do you know that just a few weeks ago, for the first time ever, laboratory animals that had their spines severed had movement in their lower limbs because of nerve transplants. There are going to be things happening in the next 10 or 20 or 30 years that we never could have imagined. And we have to be in the forefront. We recently agreed to undertake with IBM—the United States and IBM—to build a supercomputer—listen to this—a supercomputer that will do more calculations in a single second than you can go home and do on your hand-held calculator in 30,000 years."", ""The point I'm trying to make is that we are going to see Americans with more chances to live out their dreams and live up to their Godgiven abilities than at any point in the history of our great country if we make the right decisions, if we build the right sort of bridge to the 21st century, if we say we want opportunity for all, responsible citizenship from all, and everybody has a place in our community. We want everybody, everybody, without regard to where they start in life, without regard to their race or their background, if you will work hard and be a good citizen, you're a part of our country and we want to walk over that bridge into the next century with you. That's what we have to do."", 'I want us to build a bridge to the 21st century with the best education system in the world. I want every classroom and library in America, from the smallest rural schools to the most remote mountain villages to the poorest innercity schools, to be hooked up to the information superhighway by the year 2000, to the Internet, to the World Wide Web so that we can say— think of this, here in Centralia, think of this— we will be able to say by the year 2000 for the first time in our history, every child in America, no matter where he or she goes to school, will have access to the same information in the same time at the same level of quality as any other child in the richest school districts in the country, everybody has access to it immediately. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century?', 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. I want us to build a bridge to the 21st century where every young person, every middle-aged person and every older person who needs it can go to college and know that it can be paid for in a country with opportunity for all, and here's how I want to do it. Number one, I want every family to be able to take out an IRA and save in it and then withdraw from it to pay for college costs without having any taxes to pay on it."", ""Number two, number two, I want to make 2 years of community college just as universal in 4 years as a high school diploma is today. And it's easy to do. Here's how we're going to do it. We're going to say you can deduct, dollar for dollar from your tax bill, the cost of the tuition at a typical community college in America for up to 2 years. We will pay the bill by lowering your taxes for how much your tuition costs if you will just go and be a good citizen, learn a lot, improve your skills, and make America stronger. We can revolutionize America if we do it."", ""Number three, I propose to give a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year for the costs of all college tuition anywhere, undergraduate, graduate, you name it, for old, middle-aged, or the very youngest people. We need to educate America, and we can pay for this and still balance the budget. That's what we ought to do. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'I want to build a bridge to the 21st century where we keep growing jobs, 10 1/2 million jobs in the last 4 years, record numbers of new small businesses, record exports. We have to keep doing that. We can do it if we balance the budget and continue to invest in education, technology, research, the environment, protecting Medicare and Medicaid. We can grow the economy. We can have a tax cut targeted to education and childrearing and medical expenses and buying that first home and not taxing people when they sell their homes on the gain they get from the sale and still balance the budget. We can do that. Will you help me do that and build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', ""I want to finish the job of making our streets safer. Four years of declining crime, one million fewer crime victims in America—I want to keep going down. That means we've got to keep putting police on the streets of communities like this one. We've got to keep the safe and drugfree schools program and tell those in Congress who want to get rid of it and our support for the D.A.R.E. program and other things like it, we can't turn around. We've got to intensify our efforts here."", ""We've got to toughen our efforts to try to make our streets safer, but we also have to do things that give our young people things to say yes to, that give them hope: leaving our schools open later, giving them opportunities to work in the summer, improving the educational opportunities of kids that are in trouble, supporting AmeriCorps and giving more young people the chance to work their way through college and serve their communities and be good role models. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'We have to build a bridge to the 21st century that makes more communities stronger, like I see here today, starting with strong families. I am very proud of the fact that the first bill I signed was the family and medical leave law. And I might add, it really is a classic example of the differences between my opponent and his party and me. I signed it; he led the fight against it. I brag on it; he says we still made a mistake to sign it. Now, you be the judge.', ""Here's what the family and medical leave law does. It says quite simply, if you work in a business with 50 or more employees and you need a little time off from work because you or your wife is about to have a child—your spouse is about to have a child or because your child is sick or because you have a sick parent, you can take that time off and not lose your job, because we know you need to succeed at home and at work. That's what the law says."", ""Now, in 3 1/2 years, 12 million times, American families have taken advantage of that law. Has it hurt us? No. We've got 10 1/2 million more jobs. We've got record new businesses. We've got the healthiest small-business climate in history. We made every small business eligible for a tax cut if they invest more in their own business or if they invest in health insurance. We made it easier for them to take out retirement plans, but we said, look, people have to be able to succeed at raising their children and at work. That's our objective as Americans. I want more of that kind of policy for America. That's the difference between us and them. We know it takes a village. We know workers should also be good parents. We know raising children is the most important job of any society, and we want you to support our approach to that. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", ""And finally, let me say, to echo what the Vice President said, we've got a cleaner environment than we had 4 years ago. The air is cleaner, drinking water standards have been raised, safety standards for food have been raised with the support, I might add, of farmers in Washington and others throughout the country. We have cleaned up more toxic waste dumps in 3 years than the previous administrations did in 12."", 'We have saved our national parks from an ill-advised scheme to sell some of them off. Just yesterday I announced 1.7 million acres of land being established as a national monument in southern Utah, the Grand Staircase-Escalante Monument.', ""We just completed a plan to restore the salmon in the Columbia River. We just completed an agreement to protect the old-growth forest here, and timber jobs have increased, not decreased, in the last 4 years. Those who said that you couldn't protect the environment and maintain the strength of rural communities were wrong."", ""But finally, let me say, we still have some problems. This is an amazing thing. There are 10 million children living within 4 miles of a toxic waste dump. If you will give us 4 more years, we're going to clean up the two-thirds of those dumps that are the worst so we can say of all of our children, our kids are growing up next to parks, not poison. We want to preserve our environment and grow our economy. That's the way to build a bridge to the 21st century. Will you help us build that bridge? [Applause]"", ""Will you work for us for 6 weeks and 5 days and talk to your friends and neighbors and make this a campaign of ideas, not name-calling and insults? Will you ask people to think about what they want America to look like when their children are their age and to vote for that kind of America? Let's take advantage of this season. Let's create a sense of community all over this country that our elections make a difference, our votes make a difference, and this time more than any election in a very long time, we are voting for the shape of the future and voting for our children."", 'I ask you, as we look at these children— there are some children back here that have ""Centralia class of 2000."" I want them to come up on this stage when I finish. I want you to look at them, and I want you to think about them every day between now and the election and remember that\'s what this is all about.

Thank you, bands, thank you. And the Checkers, thank you. And I understand that the R.A. Long football team is undefeated and down here somewhere. Congratulations! [Applause] Thank you.', ""I'd also like to say a special word of thanks to Axel Swanson, the student body president at R.A. Long. Now, you just think about it, he got up here in front of this big crowd, and unlike me, he doesn't do this all the time. And I thought he did a terrific job, and I was really proud of him. You know, when I was his age I had a chance to shake hands with President Kennedy. It made an impression on me I never forgot. But I was looking at him today, and I can tell you that today he looks a lot more like a future President than I did then. I liked it, and I hope he does very well. Congratulations, Axel."", ""I want to thank Brian Baird for presenting himself for Congress. Ladies and gentlemen, it's hard to run for Congress these days. It's a hard and arduous task. And much to my dismay, many of these races have become so intensely negative and so difficult—often difficult to get idealistic young people to present themselves. He has, and I am confident he would do a find job representing you. I wish him well, and I hope you will wish him well and help him do well."", 'And to Gary Locke, let me say I was so impressed with the race that you and your other fellow Democrats ran in that primary. You won a hard-fought, clean, honest, progressive, forward-looking race. You can be proud of the race you just ran and the race you are now running. And I hope you folks will help to make Gary Locke the next Governor of the State of Washington, to keep moving forward into the 21st century.', ""You know, we've had a wonderful day today, and I know we're a little late, but you wouldn't believe the crowds we've seen all along the road and every place we've stopped. We began in Tacoma, where I believe we had over 25,000 people. We went to Roy and Yelm and Tenino and Centralia. And then of course we were just in Kelso, and we crossed the bridge—anybody here from Kelso? [Applause] You could have fooled me; I thought the whole town was along the highway back there. And I want to say to all of you, you cannot imagine what a source of encouragement it is to Hillary and Tipper and to Al and me to see you out here, loving your country, believing in its future, determined to play a role in its future."", ""Four years ago when I came to Washington State and the people of this State were so good in voting for me and giving me your electoral votes, I asked you to take us on faith. I had never worked in Washington, DC—the other Washington—before. I'd been a Governor for 12 years who ran for President because I didn't like what was happening to my country. I didn't like the high unemployment, the low job growth, the stagnant wages, the unaddressed social challenges. I didn't like the fact that we were growing more divided and that people were becoming ever more cynical about their political system. I didn't think we became the greatest country in the world and lasted for over 220 years by having those kind of problems and those kind of attitudes. And I wanted to change."", ""I wanted to lead this country into the 21st century with the American dream alive and well for every single American willing to work for it; with this country coming together, bridging our divisions and mutual respect, not dividing; and with our country still the strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity in the world. And I can tell you that after 4 years we're in better shape than we were 4 years ago and we're on the right track to the 21st century."", ""I welcome this debate with our opponents over the next 6 weeks and 5 days because it will be a clear picture of starkly different approaches. You could hardly find two different platforms, two different programs, two different records that were more opposite in their views of what our purposes are as a people and what our role in Washington is. You see, we really do believe that it takes a village; we don't think you're on your own. Longview looks like a pretty good village to us. We think you help each other to make the most of your own lives. We really do believe we must build a bridge to the future; we can't build a bridge to the past. We really do believe that at this moment in history, if we do the rights things, if we build the right kind of bridge, we can make it possible for more people than ever before in history to live out their dreams and live up to their God-given potential. But we have to do the right things."", ""It is not an accident that the unemployment rate is down, that the deficit has been reduced by 60 percent, that we have an all-time high in exports from Washington State and the United States, that America's auto industry is number one again, that we have 10 1/2 million jobs, that we have 10 million people about to get a pay increase when the minimum wage goes up on October 1st. That is not an accident. It is not an accident."", ""Finally, finally, we passed a meaningful piece of health care reform that says if you have to change jobs or if someone in your family gets sick, you still can't be denied health insurance. It's long past time when we should have done that."", ""It is not an accident that we made every small business in America eligible to get a tax cut if they invest more in their business to hire more people, to grow the business, to make America stronger, if they take out health insurance. We made it easier for them to take out retirement and to protect their own retirement and their employees' when they move from job to job.

It's not an accident that tens of millions of us are breathing cleaner air, that we have safer drinking water standards, higher standards for food safety, that we have saved the national parks from an ill-advised attempt to sell some of them off, that this environment is cleaner, that we've cleaned up more toxic waste sites in 3 years than were cleaned up in the previous 12. None of that is an accident. It happened because we changed the direction of this country, and we're on the right track to the 21st century."", 'It is not an accident that the crime rate has gone down for 4 years in a row. It is not an accident that finally juvenile crime has started to go down. It is not an accident that the welfare rolls have gone down by 1.8 million, that child support collections have gone up by 40 percent, and that there are one million fewer crime victims in the United States today. That is not an accident. It happened because we worked together—together—to create the conditions and to give you the tools to make the most of your own lives.

It means for the first time in history, 4 years from now, if we do our jobs, the children in the most remote rural school districts, the children in the poorest inner-city school districts, the children in the small towns and the rich towns and the middle class towns, all of our kids, for the first time ever will have access to the same learning in the same time at the same level of quality for the first time ever. Will you help us do that? [Applause]"", ""I want to build a bridge to the 21st century in which we make college educations available to all Americans who want to go whether they're young or middle aged or older. If they need to go back and get more education, they ought to be able to do it. And I want to do it in three ways."", ""First, more people saving more with IRA's and then you can withdraw from them without any tax penalty if you're going to use it to educate yourselves or your children or deal with health care or buy a first-time home."", ""Second, we want to make 2 years of education after high school as universal in 4 years from now as a high school diploma is today. Every American, we know now, needs more education. And here's how we're going to do that. We're going to let you deduct from your tax bill dollar for dollar the cost of the average tuition at the typical community college in the United States—just take it off your taxes, go back to community college, get that degree, move this country forward."", ""Third, we want to give you a deduction of up to $10,000 a year for the cost of tuition at any college anyplace in this country, whether it's undergraduate school, graduate school, a special program, you name it. If you have to go back and get more education and training to do better with your lives, even if you've been out of school for years, you ought to be able to do it. And we'll support you in doing it."", ""The second thing I want to do is to keep this economy going. We can have tax cuts, my fellow Americans, but they have to be paid for and they ought to be targeted to education, to childrearing, to buying that first-time home, to dealing with medical emergencies. You ought not to have to pay a tax if you sell your home and you've got a gain on it because it's appreciated in value over time. But we ought to pay for those things."", 'We have to continue our work to balance the budget. Why? Because we have brought the deficit down by 60 percent. That may not mean much to you. Every time I leave Washington, some political expert says, ""Now, Mr. President, don\'t go out there in the country and start talking about reducing the deficit. People only care about it when the economy is in the tank. When the economy is doing well, it bores them to tears.""', ""Here's why you shouldn't be bored. If we bring the deficit down and we borrow less money just to pay the Government's bills, then interest rates go down. For you that means a lower home mortgage payment, a lower care payment, a lower credit card payment. For business it means lower loan rates, which means they can borrow more money, hire more people, grow this economy, and take us into the 21st century. We have to balance the budget. We have to do it."", ""We can't have a tax cut so big we undermine the economic recovery of the country. What good would it do you to see this deficit blown up? You get a tax cut on one hand and turn around and have it taken away on the other hand with a higher mortgage payment, a higher credit card payment, a higher car payment, and fewer jobs in America. We've got to keep this economy growing until everybody that wants a good job has one. We need to keep going. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'I want you to help us build a bridge to the 21st century where we have security for people. We have to continue to bring the crime rate down. I am proud of the fact it\'s come down 4 years in a row. And I can\'t help but noting that right here in Washington State, a lot of congressional districts changed hands and went to the other party in 1994 because the people in the other party came out to small towns and rural areas in Washington, and they said, ""The President and his party voted for that awful crime bill, and they\'re going to take your guns away.""', '[At this point, an audience member required medical attention.]', ""The President. You need a doctor over there? Send a medic over there, right back there. We'll be right there. Just keep your hands held up. We've got the doctor back there, right back there."", 'Now, remember this—in 1994, I remember them. I remember them going into all these little towns and saying, ""Why, the President voted to take your gun away, the Democrats in Congress did. That crime bill is terrible. It\'s not going to do anything to bring down crime.""', ""Well, now we know. Four years later, we have 4 years of a declining crime rate. We're halfway home in putting 100,000 police on the street. We didn't take a single hunter's rifle away from him in Washington State or my home State of Arkansas. Everybody's still going into the woods with the same weapons they had. But 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers lost their right to buy a handgun under the Brady bill. We were right; they were wrong. They were wrong about that."", ""And we need to keep going. We should oppose their efforts to cut short the 100,000 police commitment. When you put more police officers on the street, knowing the neighbors of the people, getting to know the kids, encouraging young people to stay off drugs and out of gangs and out of trouble—when people work in partnership, they can drop the crime rate dramatically. I have been to community after community after community where people gave up on it but where the streets are now safe. And I don't want to stop until every American feels safe in their homes, on their streets, in their schools, in their places of work. We can do this. And I want you to help me build that bridge to the 21st century."", 'Let me also say that in every election people always talk about family values. Well, our administration has tried to value families. Tipper Gore has worked for 20 years to try to create conditions in which people could raise children without having them subject to destructive influences from our larger culture. The First Lady has worked for over 20 years to try to help improve the conditions of childrearing and health care for our young children.', 'We were the first administration in history that took on the tobacco industry and said it is illegal to sell cigarettes to young people— no more advertising, marketing, and sales to them. It is wrong.', ""The first bill I signed was the family and medical leave law. It said simply you can't be fired if you have to take a little time off for the birth of a child or the illness of a child or a parent. Now, this is a classic example of our differences. My opponent led the fight against that law. He says today, we made a terrible mistake to pass it, that it was antibusiness. Well, if it was antibusiness, how come we got 10 1/2 million more jobs and record numbers of new small businesses? It wasn't antibusiness. People do better at work if they know they're doing right by their kids at home. That's what I mean by a village, a bridge we can all walk across."", ""And I'd like to see the family and medical leave law expanded just a little bit to say that people shouldn't lose their jobs either—they ought to have a little time off to go to regular conferences with their children's teachers and to be able to take their kids and their parents to the doctor when they need to go. It will make us stronger. It will be a good thing for the economy."", ""The last thing I want to say is the Vice President and I worked very hard to prove that you could grow the economy and preserve the environment and that in the end you can't grow the economy unless you preserve the environment. I told you a few minutes ago we cleaned up a lot of toxic waste dumps. That's the good news. The bad news is 10 million American children still live within 4 miles of a toxic waste site. If you give us 4 more years, we'll get rid of the two-thirds worst ones, 500 of them, so we can say America's children are growing up next to parks like this, not next to poison. That's a big part of our bridge to the 21st century."", ""Now, I want to ask you again, I want you to take the next 6 weeks and 5 days, go out to your friends and neighbors, without regard to their party, and say, let's have a talk about what we want America to look like in the 21st century. Let's have a talk about what we want America to look like when our children are our age. Let's have a talk about this election because we're electing the last President of the 20th century and the first President of the 21st century.

Second, what do we have to do to keep our country coming together? We're becoming increasingly diverse and different. How can we come together in mutual respect to build the bonds of strong communities to make a strong nation? How can we beat the odds and not become like so many other countries that are being torn apart by their differences, their religious, their racial, their ethnic, their tribal differences? That's not America. We need to be a strong community, just like this is a strong community. And finally, how can we keep on leading the world for peace and freedom and prosperity? We've worked on that for 4 years, with a simple strategy: opportunity for every American, responsibility from every American, and a real effort to build our community together."", ""Now, I tell you, yes, we're better off than we were 4 years ago, and it wasn't an accident.

They said if our budget plan passed, it would bring on a recession and increase the deficit; that's what they said. Well, 4 years later we've reduced the deficit 4 years in a row for the first time since the 1840's, we have 10 1/2 million new jobs, our auto industry is number one, we have record exports, record small businesses.

Of course, we\'re all against crime, but what I found when I came to Washington is, we\'d had 6 long years of talks, and nothing but hot air and nothing to show for it.', 'We passed a crime bill that our opponents led the opposition to, to put 100,000 police on the street, to have a ""three strikes and you\'re out"" law, to have much tougher punishment, to ban 19 kinds of assault weapons, to protect hunting and sporting weapons. We passed the Brady bill over their opposition. What\'s happened? Four years in a row, we\'re halfway home on 100,000 police; we stopped them when they tried to repeal the 100,000 police; we took the assault weapons off the street; 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers didn\'t get handguns, but all the Washington hunters still have their hunting rifles. I believe we were right, and they were wrong, and we need to keep on going in that direction.', ""We've moved almost 2 million people off the welfare rolls, increased child support collections by 40 percent. There are a million fewer crime victims in America today. We are moving in the right direction. As the Vice President said, while growing the economy we've worked hard to make the air cleaner, the drinking water and the food safer, to protect our natural resources and to expand them."", ""Folks, we're moving in the right direction. And I want to ask you to help me build a bridge to the 21st century where we keep cleaning up the environment, where we keep bringing crime down. If we bring it down 8 years in a row instead of 4, it'll be about low enough so we'll actually be surprised when we see a crime on the evening news at night, and our children will be safe on the streets."", ""I want you to help me to keep building strong families. One of the most interesting issues of this election is that the first bill I signed when I became President was a bill, again, which was opposed by my opponent and Speaker Gingrich. They led the opposition to it, the family and medical leave law. They said it was bad for business, bad for business to say you could have a little time off when your baby is born or your parent's sick without losing your job. We did it. Twelve million families have taken advantage of it, and 10 1/2 million jobs later, we know it was good for business. America is stronger when we can raise our children and work and succeed at the same time."", ""So I want you to help me do better. I'd like to see people be able to take a little time off to go to their children's regular meetings with their teachers, the parent-teacher conferences, and take their folks to medical appointments, and we'll be stronger because of it. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. I want to build a bridge to the 21st century where we keep this economy growing, where we expand trade even more. Washington State—because we've had over 200 separate trade agreements, the people of Washington are selling more airplanes, more computer software, and apples from Washington for the first time all the way in Japan. We need more of that, and I will give you more of it."", 'We need to balance the budget, and we can cut taxes. But we only can cut the taxes that we can pay for balancing the budget. Why? Because when we bring this deficit down, it keeps interest rates down; it means your car payment, your credit card payment, your house payments are lower; it means businesses can borrow money to hire people to grow the economy. We have to continue.', ""We cannot have a tax cut that's so big that we have to have the Government start borrowing more money again to drive up your interest rates. Somebody gives you that kind of a tax cut, they're going to take it right back out in higher interest rates for credit cards, car payments, and home mortgages, and businesses won't be growing again."", ""So yes, let's cut taxes for education, for childrearing, for medical care, for buying that first-time home. Let's don't charge people a tax on the gain when they sell their homes, but let's pay for it in a balanced budget. Let's do that."", ""Finally, let me remind you what is at stake. We also have to balance the budget without undermining our commitments to education, to the environment, to Medicaid's commitment to little children, to the seniors in nursing homes, to families with disabilities, most of them middle class families, without creating a two-tier system of Medicare that will be unfair to our seniors. We can do that, folks, without walking away from research."", ""I want you to think about this. We have to balance the budget, but we do not have to cut Head Start. We do not have to raise taxes on the poorest working people. We do not have to do it in ways that allow corporations to raid their workers' pension funds. We don't have to do it in a way that abolishes the safe and drugfree school program, the AmeriCorps program, gets rid of direct student loans which have helped millions and millions of young people in this country. They were wrong. Our way of balancing the budget is better. And I hope you'll support it. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. Finally, most important of all, we've got to create a bridge that all of our children can walk across that gives every American without regard to their age access to a lifetime of educational opportunity."", 'And I just want to mention two things. Number one, I want to see every classroom and library in America hooked up to the Internet by the year 2000, hooked up to the World Wide Web. I want to make sure that children in small towns, children in inner-city neighborhoods, children in Native American tribes on reservations—children everywhere—for the first time in the history of this country have access to the same learning in the same way at the same level of quality in the same time—everybody. It has never happened. We can do it. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. And the second thing I want to say is, I want you to help me make a college education available to every single American citizen who needs it. And we propose to do it with three simple steps.', ""First, let families save in an IRA, an individual retirement account, and then withdraw from it tax-free if they're spending the money on a college education for their children or themselves."", ""Second, second, let's make a commitment that by the year 2000, at least 2 years of education after high school, a community college diploma, will be just as normal, just as usual, just as universal as a high school diploma is today. We can do it. Here's how: I propose to let you take a credit, just take it off your taxes, dollar for dollar, for the cost of tuition at the typical community college in America. You go find the college, reduce your taxes by the tuition. That way we'll pay for everybody who needs it to go to community college. And we can do it and balance the budget."", 'And third, third, for people who want to go to the 4-year colleges or to graduate school— of any age—people that were working and have to go back—I think we should allow you a deduction on your taxes of up to $10,000 for the cost of college tuition every year. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Folks, there are 6 weeks and 5 days to this election. I have done everything I could do to make this an election of ideas, not insults, to stop the old-fashioned Washington politics of dividing people. There was a sign at our last rally that said, ""We don\'t need division. We need vision."" And I believe that. We need more of that.', 'So I want to ask you: Will you take some time every day that you possibly can between now and the election to reach out to your family members, your friends, your parents, your children, your cousins, your uncles, your aunts, your coworkers, the people you go bowling with, the people you ate lunch with and talk to them about what they want America to look like when we start that new century?', ""I'm telling you, there is no nation in the world as well-positioned as the United States for the 21st century. It is there for us if we build the right bridge. Our best days are ahead if you will help us build that bridge to tomorrow. Will you do it?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Thank you, and God bless you.']"
81,William J. Clinton ,"September 20, 1996","['Thank you. Good morning, Portland! Mayor Katz, Congresswoman Furse, Tom Bruggere, Darlene Hooley, Mike Dugan. Thank you all for being here with us. Madame Mayor and Congresswoman Furse, thank you for making us feel so welcome in Portland again. Maybe I come back here so often because I like it.', 'I must say, I have to hand it to the Vice President. I didn\'t think anyone could keep a secret in Washington. Al Gore cut a book deal with a book full of secrets. It never leaked. Now he\'s telling it all, and he wrote the book under his own name. Al Gore is doing for the Federal Government what he did for the macarena. He is removing all the unnecessary steps. [Laughter] Now, he\'s got some funny names here. He calls for performance-based organizations—that\'s sort of a boring title. I think we ought to scrap that title and substitute something more exciting, like ""Trailblazers."" Would you like that? [Applause]', ""I want to thank Tipper Gore and the First Lady, too, for some things they've already talked about. You know, we've worked very hard to improve the health care of the American people. That's a big part of moving into the 21st century, to immunize more children, to increase medical research, to speed the movement of drugs to market. In only 4 years we've more than doubled the life expectancy of people with HIV and AIDS in just 4 years, as an example. Finally, we got the Congress to pass the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that says to 25 million Americans, you can't lose your health insurance or have it taken away anymore just because someone in your family gets sick or because you change jobs."", ""And yesterday we had three big victories. Congress did, as Hillary said, answer our call to tell the insurance companies that newborns and their mothers deserve at least 48 hours in the hospital. They can't be kicked out 8 hours after delivery anymore. Congress responded to the work that Tipper Gore has been doing for years and years and years in a bipartisan fashion that also included Senator Domenici from New Mexico in saying that it is time to ensure that people who need treatment for mental illness get the treatment they need also and without discrimination. And finally, I want to say a special word of thanks to the work that the Congress did in our continuing efforts to be fair to veterans and their families who have served us in foreign theaters and may have been exposed to dangerous chemicals, when they provided health benefits to veterans whose children are born with spina bifida. Those were three great things to do for America yesterday, and I thank the Congress for doing it."", ""I'm happy to be back in Portland. I'll never forget what I saw here last spring when I visited during the floods: the true spirit of America. The pioneering spirit is alive and well in Oregon. But I was glad to hear the mayor remind me that you have 10 bridges here, and in Oregon you want to build a bridge to the 21st century."", 'In 1992 the people of Oregon supported the Vice President and me when we came here and asked you to help us to put people first and to change the direction of our country, to put America on the right track and to change the way Government works, to make sure that when we enter the 21st century, as I look out at this sea of people, that every one of you will enter a century with the American dream alive and well for every person who is willing to work for it, that we will enter a century in which America is coming together and embracing its diversity, not being torn apart by it as so many other nations are all around the world, and that we would not run away from our responsibilities to be the strongest force for peace and freedom and security in the world.', ""The best days of this country are still ahead of us if we build the right bridge to the 21st century. Now, in this election season you will hear a lot of rhetoric back and forth and maybe a lot of characterizations of people's motives. I've tried to stay away from that. I don't want to demean anybody. I want this to be an election season of ideas, not insults. I want to ask, what are we going to do, not who can we blame. How are we going to build this country and move it together."", ""But I must say, there are some facts that you can't get around. It is a fact that we have 10 1/2 million more jobs; the lowest unemployment rate in 7 1/2 years; almost 4 1/2 million new homeowners; the deficit going down for all 4 years of an administration for the first time since before the Civil War, in the 1840's; a record number of exports; record small businesses. On October 1st 10 million hard-working Americans will get an increase in their minimum wage. Every small business in the country has been made eligible for a tax cut when they buy health insurance or if they invest more money in their business to hire more people and grow and help America grow. The welfare rolls are down by 1.8 million. Child support collections are up by 40 percent—$3 billion. The drinking water is safer. The air is purer. Our food standards are much higher. As the Vice President said, just in the last week we have reached an agreement to restore the salmon on the Columbia River and an agreement to protect the old-growth forest in Oregon and Washington. Just a couple of days ago I was honored to proclaim a 1.7million-acre national monument, the Grand Staircase-Escalante Monument in southern Utah. We are moving this country in the right direction."", 'And now we have to continue to build that bridge to the future, a bridge where there is opportunity for all, starting with the best education for every single American. We ought to be lifting our teachers and our students up, not running our teachers down, as some are doing in this election season.', ""I ask you to join me in helping every classroom to be connected to the information superhighway by the year 2000. If every classroom is tied into the Internet and the World Wide Web, we can make sure for the first time in history that every child in America, in the poorest rural district, in the most devastated economic areas of the country, in isolated innercity districts, in middle class and wealthy districts, that all together, at the same time have access to the same information in the same way. It's never happened before. Will you help us make it happen in the future? [Applause]"", ""I ask you to help me in opening the doors of college education to all Americans who want to go. In the past 4 years, we passed the AmeriCorps program, and 50,000 young Americans have built communities like Portland and earned their way through college. We've revolutionized the student loan program to lower the cost and improve the repayment terms so that anybody could borrow the money and know they wouldn't go broke trying to pay it back. But now we have to do more. I propose to make a college education universal by doing three things."", ""Number one, saying you can save in an IRA for years and years and then withdraw from that IRA tax-free if you're using it to pay for a college education or a health emergency or buying a first home."", ""Number two, saying we're going to make a community college education, at least 2 years of education after high school, just as common and universal in 4 years as a high school diploma is today. We need that to start the new century. And here's how we're going to do it. We're going to say to Americans, if you want to go to community college for 2 years, all you have to do is work hard, make your grades. You can take off your taxes, dollar for dollar, the tuition cost at the typical community college in the United States."", 'And number three, we want to say to all students of whatever age in whatever college in America, undergraduate and graduate, you ought to be able to deduct from your taxes the cost of college tuition up to $10,000 a year.', 'I want to build a bridge to the 21st century that keeps this economy going strong. That means we have to pay for those tax cuts and the tax cuts for childrearing and for buying and selling your home in the context of a balanced budget that continues to invest in education, in the environment, in research, in technology, and protects our obligations through Medicare and Medicaid. We can do that if you will help us build that bridge to the 21st century', ""The crime rate has come down for 4 years in a row, the juvenile crime rate is starting to drop, the juvenile murder rate has come way down. We are moving in the right direction, but I want to keep going. I want to rebuff those in the Congress who are trying to stop us from putting 100,000 police on the street. We're halfway home; I want to finish the job."", ""I want to see us—we passed the Brady bill. Now we ought to extend the Brady bill. Sixty thousand felons, fugitives, and stalkers have not gotten handguns because of the Brady bill. I think we ought to extend it to people who beat up their spouses and their children. They shouldn't have handguns either."", 'I want to build a bridge to the 21st century where we have a stronger American community. I am very proud that the first bill I signed after becoming President was the family and medical leave law. Over the strong opposition of the leaders of the other party, we passed it. They said it would hurt the economy. They said it would weaken business. They said it would burden small business.', ""Well, 4 years later, we have 10 1/2 million new jobs, record numbers of new small businesses, record numbers of new businesses owned by women and minorities, and 12 million families have taken advantage of the family and medical leave law to have a child born, to tend to a sick parent, a sick child, a sick spouse. I'm telling you, we're stronger because we did that. And I want to see us expand that. I believe we ought to expand the family and medical leave law to say that parents should be able to go see their children's teachers on a regular basis and be able to take their kids and their folks to the doctor without losing their jobs. It won't hurt the economy; we'll have a stronger economy when people can care for their family members."", ""And finally, we have a lot of work to do in the environment to build the strong American community. Let me just mention one thing. We have 10 million children still living within 4 miles of a toxic waste site, even though we've cleaned up more of them in 3 years than were cleaned up in the 12 years before we took office. If you will give us 4 more years, we'll clean up 500 more, so we can say our children are growing up next to parks, not poison. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", ""Now, let me tell you the reason we decided to do this reinventing Government announcement here is because Oregon and particularly the city of Portland have led the way in proving you can have a Government that actually works for people, that inspires confidence, that gets results. When we took office, the deficit was $290 billion a year and going higher. We had the slowest job growth rate since the Great Depression. You have cheered for the achievements of the administration. You have cheered for the things we want to do. We cannot do these things and we could not have achieved what has been done in the last 4 years had it not been for the leadership of the Vice President and our determination to give you a Government that costs less and does more. That's what reinventing Government does. It makes it possible for us to do the other things that you have cheered for, that you are working for here today."", ""And so I say to you, this book the Vice President gives me today is a book that Americans ought to be interested in. It says we're bringing common sense to Government. In everything from hiring people to buying things, we've eliminated doubletalk and bureaucracy."", ""Do you know when I became President, if you wanted to buy—if a Government agency wanted to buy a $4 stapler, they had to do $50 worth of paperwork. Now we can buy a $4 stapler for $4. That's $46 we can spend on Head Start programs, on environmental protection, on investing in medical research."", ""The second thing we're doing is serving people better. We have ended the era when people could run for office, desperate to be in Government, by just bad-mouthing Government. A lot of our friends on the other side have amazed me; they bad-mouth and bad-mouth and badmouth the Government, but they can't bear to live outside of it."", 'We have proved that you can make Government work. One woman from Sacramento was so overwhelmed by the fast and friendly service she got from the Social Security office, she wrote to tell us it left her, and I quote, ""dazed and confused."" She could not believe that her Government would do anything that well.', ""Well, we're doing a lot of things that well. The direct student loan program cuts the cost of college loans but improves the repayment terms, says you can only be required to pay it back as a percentage of your income. So go on and borrow the money and go to college and give yourself a better life."", ""The SBA loan program, which has helped us to start a record number of small businesses, has been cut down to one page. And we have dramatically increased loans to women and minority business owners without undermining the quality. We've proved that we can diversify educational opportunities and economic opportunities and achieve excellence in both."", 'At the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Henry Cisneros has managed to cut about $1,000 off the closing costs for the average first-time homebuyers and, in a time of budget cuts, to initiate programs that decrease homelessness in communities all across America.', ""We can make this Government work for you, and we're determined to do it. Wherever they have been willing to do it, we've used businesses as partners. After all, what we want is cleaner air, cleaner water, safer food. We don't want punishment. If Government and business can work as partners, we want to do it."", ""And we want to be partners with communities. That's what Oregon is all about. Let me tell you, as you think about welfare reform, the partnership that the United States has had with Oregon and with the city of Portland can be a model for how we can make welfare reform work. I signed that bill because it has a new bargain for people on welfare. It says, we'll continue to have a national guarantee for health care, for nutrition for children. If you go to work, we'll spend more than ever on child care. But we're going to give the money that used to be in the welfare check to the States so they can develop community-based systems, not only to give income to people but to move ablebodied people into the work force. The only way that can be done is if there is a communitybased system where people are committed to going out and challenging employers and saying, okay, we'll give you some help to do it, but you've been cussing the welfare system all these years, now hire these people, give them a job. We'll support them with child care and education. That has to happen in the communities of America, and we trust Portland to do it. We trust Oregon to do it. You can lead America's way in doing it."", 'So yes, reinventing Government means doing more efficient things. It means doing better things. It means doing with less. It also means improvements in Medicare and Medicaid, in our educational programs, in our support for small business, in our environmental protection. It means improvements in our national parks, not selling them off, and it means help in emergencies.', 'I want to say that one of my proudest achievements as President is reforming the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It had become such a disaster itself that Congress even considered abolishing it. But as Portland, as Oregon, as Washington State saw during the flood, as California saw in earthquakes and fires and floods, as we saw in the Middle West where they had a 500-year flood and in the hurricanes along the eastern coast of America, we have an Emergency Management Agency today that works with people on the ground and helps people and helps communities to rebuild their lives. That is something that is worth fighting for.', ""So, I want to ask you to support us in this effort. I want you to know that when we balance the budget in 2002, we're still going to be spending more money on education and research and protecting the environment. So we're going to have to have a smaller and more productive Government. We're going to have to privatize organizations that can now work better in the private sector, like Sallie Mae. We've got the direct student loan program. They need to be able to do some other things as well."", ""We want hundreds of organizations to become performance-based, to be trailblazers in increasing productivity and making their customers happy. I don't want people to be dazed and confused if they're well-served by the Government, like that lady in Sacramento was."", ""Let me give you one example—very important in Oregon and every State with a high-tech base. We want the patent office to become performance-based. Today when an inventor applies for a patent, it takes almost 600 days for the inventor to get it. When we get done, we'll be able to give them those patents in 60 days, onetenth of the time. That means more progress for America, more new jobs, more advances in high technology."", 'And finally, we want to use technology to open Government to people more. Today I want to announce that the White House home page, which many of you have already used on the Internet—see that sign ""Portland wants Socks""—even my cat has a place on our home page. [Laughter] Now we\'re going to make it a one-stop gateway to Government service. From now on, you can use the home page at the White House to apply for a passport, ask about veterans\' benefits, even to buy postage stamps. Transactions, forms, information, it\'s all there. And it won\'t be like waiting in a line. There are no lines on-line. This is an example of what we can do to save money, serve you better, and free up money not only to balance the budget but to invest in our children\'s future.', 'If you want to build a bridge to the 21st century with a strong economy, good schools, safe streets, a clean environment, healthy children, successful families and communities, you must join us in this commitment to say we can make our Government work for all the people. Will you help us build that bridge in the next 6 weeks and 4 days? [Applause]', 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"
82,William J. Clinton ,"September 20, 1996","['Give them a hand. [Applause] I thought they did well. Did you read somewhere that that was my favorite Beatles song? [Laughter] Or did you just do it on your—it was a wonderful job. Thank you very much, and thank you for playing here tonight.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to be back in South Dakota. I came here three times when I was seeking the Presidency. I loved every trip. I couldn\'t wait to get back. And I want you to know how we came to be here tonight. We were planning our schedule a couple of weeks ago, and we were going to do this bus trip in Washington and Oregon, and I looked at the map and I looked at the schedule and I looked at the time, and they said, ""You\'re going to be dead when you finish."" I said, ""I\'m not going to be that tired. I want to go to South Dakota before I go back to Washington."" And I\'m glad to be here.', 'I want to thank all of those who have been here before tonight, your student, Kelly Soye, Senator Chet Jones, Rick Weiland. Thank you for running for Congress, Rick, and I hope you make it. I want to thank Sarah Sholz for that wonderful introduction of Hillary. I liked it even better than she did. [Laughter] It meant a lot to me, and I appreciate it.', ""I want to thank my longtime friend of nearly 25 years now, Senator George McGovern, for being here tonight, for his life and public service, and for his wonderful and very brave book about his beloved daughter. And I'm glad he's home in South Dakota. I'm honored to be here on the same platform with him tonight. Thank you."", 'I want to thank your superintendent, George Gulson, and your principal, Don Kuchel, for letting me come here. And thank you for delaying the homecoming just a little bit. We needed to stop until it quit raining anyway. [Laughter] I am really pleased to see all of you here. I want to say a special word of thanks to the football teams. They came out in the back, and I got to shake hands with all the football teams and all the folks that were there supporting them and take my picture with them. And they made me feel young again. I liked it, standing up there with them. [Applause] Thank you.', ""I want to acknowledge one other legislator who is here, State Senator Pam Nelson. She is running for public utility commissioner. I used to spend a lot of time on public utilities. We're just in a period of deregulating them more with the telecommunications act. And it's very important that we preserve all the telecommunications operations we can in rural America. I come from a rural State, and I know that this is a big election for you. And I wish her well, and I wish South Dakota well in dealing with these new challenges."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, I wish I could watch the whole football game. I was sitting here thinking it's been a long time since I've been to a high school football game, and I never had a bad time at a single one I attended in my whole life."", ""Tim Johnson said this election has been going on a long time. It hasn't gone on forever; it just seems like it's gone on forever. [Laughter] But it won't be long now. And I wanted to come here tonight to say to all of you really two things. First of all, from my perspective and not just because he is a Democrat and a member of my party, I think Tim Johnson is one of the most gifted public servants with whom I have ever worked. He is highly respected, and I wish him well. The second thing I wanted to say is, when I came to South Dakota, I thought I would feel fairly comfortable because I was Governor of a farming State for many years, and I grew up in Arkansas and all my people were from there. And when I first started coming up here I found some people from there who had ties to people up here, and it was a very personal experience for me."", ""I ran for President because, frankly, I was turned off by what I thought was going on in Washington. I could see that our country was moving into a period of dramatic, breathtaking change and our patterns of working and living and relating to each other, relating to the rest of the world. And it seemed to me that most of what I heard coming out of Washington, DC, was argument. And there was a lot more focus on who to blame than what to do. And where I came from, if I'd focused on who to blame instead of what to do, I'd have been thrown out of office and been looking for another job. And it seemed to me that what we needed was to bring ideas back to Washington and action and get rid of the insults and the blaming and the trying to divide people, and try to run the country the way you try to run this community or this school or this football team or any other enterprise where people have to work to succeed."", ""So when these two teams go out to compete tonight, you know, nobody would get any points for breaking the rules or bad-mouthing their opponents. There is a set of rules, everybody has to work together, and if you do your best, you're better off whether you win or not. That's the way this country ought to work. That's the way this country ought to work."", ""So I have tried to follow a simple vision. You see, I believe that the best days of this country are still ahead, and I think—I can talk in the dark if you can listen. I believe the best days of our country are still ahead, and I think that what we have to do is to find a way to meet the incredible challenges and seize the opportunities of this new world without giving up the values that make our lives special. And to me, that means we have to do three things: fix the electricity—[laughter] Now, where was I here? We've got to try to create the conditions in which every person who is willing to work for it has an opportunity. We have to tell everybody there are some things nobody can give you, and all of our citizens have to be more responsible. And then we've got to bring this country together in a community, a sense of teamwork, a sense of family, a sense of togetherness."", ""You know, there is not much diversity maybe in South Dakota or in Arkansas, but when we had the Olympics and Hillary and I went to Atlanta to kick them off, there were 197 different nations there. We've got folks from 150 of those places in our biggest county in America. But we have somehow found a way to stay together and work together because our country is founded on a devotion to this place and to the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, the idea of work and family, reverence for faith, everybody else's as well as your own. That's what holds us together."", ""And you know, I spend so much time as your President when I have to deal with foreign policy—you think about how much time I have to spend because other people won't behave that way. People around the world, they do things that you wouldn't put up with your kids doing, because they have to look down on other people who are different from them. What's the problem in Bosnia, those people killing each other because they're of different ethnic and religious backgrounds? Do you know, biologically, they're identical? There is no ethnic difference. It's an historical accident that some were Serbs, some were Croatians, and some were Muslims."", ""In the Middle East they're still fighting. In Northern Ireland they're fighting over what happened 600 years ago. All of the young folks just want to get on about their lives. And I tell you that to make the point that this is a very special place. And if we can go into this 21st century committed to working together and staying together and building a bridge that we can all walk across, we're going to do very well."", ""And let me just give you one or two examples. I think we have to build a bridge to the 21st century with a strong economy. And I'm proud of the fact that we have 10 1/2 million more jobs and record exports and record farm exports and record new small businesses in the 4 years since I became President. I think that's a good thing."", ""I'm proud of the fact that, on October 1st, 10 million Americans will get an increase in the minimum wage and, at the same time, every single small business in America will be made eligible for a tax cut when they invest more in their business. And we're making it easier for those folks and self-employed people, including farmers, to take out health insurance, because they'll get a bigger tax deduction for the cost of their health insurance premium. And we're giving a $5,000 tax credit to couples that will adopt children, because there are a lot of kids out there that need homes."", ""All of those things were done together, probusiness, pro-work, pro-family. That's the way America ought to work all of the time, and I'm proud of that. But—Tim Johnson alluded to it, but when we were having the debate over the farm bill, we hung pretty tough, Tim and I and, most important, Tom Daschle, who can't be with us tonight, but he led our fight to make sure we kept some provisions for rural development in there, to make sure that we didn't walk away from our commitments to rural water systems and other things that people in the rural areas of our country need. And we may have to take some more looks at that next year."", ""But one of the things, it seems to me, we have to commit ourselves to is the proposition that the prosperity that America enjoys in general should be made available to every American if they're willing to work for it, and I hope you will share that commitment."", ""I'll give you another example. You're going to have a big challenge in South Dakota next year; every State will. I signed the welfare reform bill, and I did it for a simple reason: I learned as Governor and as President that people in Washington don't move people in South Dakota or Arkansas off welfare; it happens at the grassroots level. And after 4 years, I'm proud to tell you that we've reduced the welfare rolls in America by nearly 2 million, and we've increased child support collections by nearly 40 percent, over $3 billion. And we have done it by letting local people do what they knew would work."", ""So that welfare reform bill, here's what it says. It says the United States will continue to guarantee to poor families health care, nutrition for the children, if the parents go to work, child care. But we're going to give what used to be the welfare check to the States and let the States and the local communities take that money and figure out how to put able-bodied people in the work force. They can spend that money on doing that, so that people can draw a paycheck, not a welfare check, and move to independence. You have to meet that challenge. Every church, every business, every organization in this State is going to have to think about what we all have to do together to end the culture of poverty. But work is better than welfare for parents, for families, and for America's future, and I hope you will help me build that kind of bridge to the 21st century."", ""The most important thing we can do in building that bridge is to give every child access to the best education in the world. I know that this school district has one of the highest attendance rates in the entire State of South Dakota, which means it's way above the national average. So I want to start by saying, good for you; don't give it up; bear down and do better. I congratulate you on that."", ""But I could talk about education the halftime of the homecoming game, but I won't do that. Let me just mention two things. Number one, I know that South Dakota has done a lot of work in distance learning and trying to use technology to bring the benefits of all kinds of subjects to young people who are isolated in rural areas. I worked hard on that when I was a Governor."", ""Al Gore and I are committed to seeing that by the year 2000, every classroom and library in our country is not only equipped with computers, software, and trained teachers but is also hooked up to what we call the information superhighway, to the Internet, to the World Wide Web. Now, for those of you that are my age or older and don't know much about computers, just like I don't, let me tell you what that means in practical terms. It means that technology has given us the opportunity for the first time in the entire history of the United States to guarantee to every student, the students in the most remote rural districts, the students in the poorest inner-city districts, along with the students in the suburban districts, the students in the richest districts—all of them now have a chance to get the same information in the same way in the same time at the same level of quality as any other student in America or indeed in the world. That will revolutionize education in America if we get that done. That's a bridge to the 21st century, and I want us to build it."", 'The other thing I think we have to do is to make a college education available to every single American who needs to go, not only kids coming out of high school but a lot of older folks are going to have to go back and get education and training as well, and we need to make it available.', ""So in the balanced budget plan that Tim and I have been working for, there are three provisions to help make college education universal. Number one, we make it easier for more people to save more money through IRA's, individual retirement accounts, and withdraw from them later without a tax penalty if the money is going to be spent on a college education or a health emergency or buying a first-time home."", 'Number two, we want to make at least 2 years of education at a community college as universal in the next 4 years as a high school diploma is today, because our young people need it and a lot of our adults are going to need it when they move from job to job. And here is how we can do that, all paid for in our balanced budget plan. We want to give a tax credit, a dollar-for-dollar reduction off your Federal tax bill, for the cost of tuition at the typical community college for 2 years. All you have to do is show up, go make your grades, make the most of it, and we will pay the bill in that way. No bureaucracy, no hassle, no nothing. We can make a community college education as universal as a high school diploma in just 2 years.', ""And finally, I believe we ought to have a tax deduction for the cost of college tuition, up to $10,000 a year, for any kind of college costs. Four years of undergraduate school, medical school, veterinary school, you name it, we ought to make it possible for every child here tonight who wants to go to college to go to college. And that's a bridge to the 21st century we ought to build."", ""Tim mentioned something about the family leave law. Let me say we've worked hard to make family life more secure over the generations. We've worked to increase childhood immunizations, to improve and increase Head Start. We've worked hard to make it easier— one of the most important bills we passed in this Congress makes it easier for people in small businesses to take out pensions and easier for people to carry those pensions around with them if they move from job to job. People in smaller businesses should be able to do that."", ""Only about half the American work force has a good pension plan today. Under this new law, it'll be a lot easier for a lot more people and a lot more employers to participate in guaranteeing pensions to more Americans, and I'm proud of that. I think it'll help South Dakota; I know it'll help my home State. Small businesses are creating most of the jobs in this country, and we need to be doing more to support them. This pension bill will do that."", ""We also passed a bill, the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, which says to 25 million Americans, an insurance company cannot automatically take your insurance away from you, your health insurance now, just because somebody in your family got sick or because you moved from job to job. You've got a right to keep that insurance. That can help 25 million Americans. Seven hundred thousand kids a year can be protected by that—just children alone, poor children, new children every year."", ""Just this week, the Congress agreed to two things I've been asking to do: one, to offer some coverage for mental health conditions. You know, that's a big problem in every State in America, in all kinds of families, little communities and big ones. We now know that a lot of mental health problems are just that, they're health problems. They can be treated. People can get over them; they can work through them. But there's no insurance in most places under most policies. Now we'll begin to change that, and I think that's a positive thing for America."", ""And most important to me—and this is something my wife's been working on forever and a day—20 years ago, the average hospital stay for a mother who went in to have a baby was 4 days. By 1992, when I was running for President, the average hospital stay had dropped substantially. By the time I was in office, I noticed that more and more insurance companies were actually requiring mothers and their newborns to leave after a day; some of them were being pushed out of the hospital in 8 hours. And it seems to me that the decision about when a mother and a newborn child leave the hospital should be a medical decision for the doctor to make. Today Congress has voted to say you get at least 48 hours, and 96 hours if you have a cesarean. I think that's a good thing for America. It will make us stronger."", ""So, I say to all of you, these are things we can do to build America's families. In our budget plan, we've got a plan, also, to help people who are between jobs, who lose their jobs and don't have another one, keep their insurance for 6 months, their health insurance—paid for in the balanced budget plan."", ""In our budget plan, we have a provision to help families who are caring for their relatives with Alzheimer's disease to get a little respite care. That will save us money, because a lot of families want to care for their parents. But that's a full-time job; that's 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and families that are doing that need a little break. So it will save us money in the long run, and we can afford it in our budget plan."", ""These are things that—each of them may seem like a small thing, but when you add them all up, we're building the fabric in America that I think is important, where people can succeed at home and succeed at work. I never go anyplace in America that families don't come up and talk to me with the conflicts they feel; nearly every family has felt some conflict between their job as parents and their job at work."", ""If we have to make a choice, folks, we're in deep trouble. Most parents are working; most parents have to work. We've got to create a country where you can win at home and win at work, be a good parent, be a successful employee or employer. And that's the way to build the right kind of bridge to the 21st century we can all walk across."", ""Finally, let me just say this: I have worked very hard to prove that we don't have to make a choice between growing our economy and protecting our environment. Most farmers I know care a lot about the environment. The agricultural community did a remarkable thing this year. They all came in and agreed on a new pesticide protection act which repealed the old Delaney clause, which a lot of farmers found absolutely unenforceable and that they couldn't comply with, and instead subjected all kinds of foods, processed foods and raw foods, to new standards to protect not just against cancer but all other kinds of illnesses—supported by the agricultural community, supported by the consumer community. It's the way America ought to work."", ""We've passed unanimously a new food protection act which will be better for farmers and better for the children in the future of America. That's the kind of solution we need to find to our public health and our environmental problems."", 'We\'ve made the air cleaner, the drinking water safer. We\'ve destroyed and cleaned up more toxic waste dumps in 3 years than were cleaned up in the 12 years before I became President. But I want you to know something here in South Dakota on this beautiful night. We still have a lot of challenges. There are still 10 million kids in this country living within 4 miles of a toxic waste dump. That may be hard to imagine out here where you\'ve got all the space in the world, but that\'s terrifying for parents. And one of the things we intend to do in the next 4 years is to take the 500 worst dumps, that\'s two-thirds of all that are left, and get rid of them so every American child can be saying, ""I\'m growing up next to a park, not next to poison."" We have to build an environmentally friendly economy, and we can do it by working together.', ""So I say to you, finally, I want you to think about this election not in partisan terms but in American terms. You're electing the last President of the 20th century, the first President of the 21st century. The Congress you elect will make decisions that will shape this country for 50 years. We hit periods like this every so often."", 'When we started as a country, our founding families had to say, ""Well, are we going to be one nation or just 13 different States?"" They decided we\'d be one nation. If they hadn\'t made that decision, you and I wouldn\'t be Americans today. They would never have gotten around the Louisiana Purchase and making Arkansas and then later making South Dakota a State. That\'s a big deal. Two hundred and twenty years later it still is felt.', 'We fought a Civil War over whether the country could break apart. When we became primarily an industrial country, we had to make new decisions about what kind of country we were going to be a hundred years ago. And Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson led us in that.', ""Now we're moving into a global economy where information and ideas and technology goes around the world, where American farm prices are up, based in no small measure on what happens elsewhere, and where our exports are at an all-time high, where I can go around the world—I was just in Washington State, and it was interesting; since I've been President, they're selling more airplanes and more computer software, but they're also selling their apples for the first time to Japan."", ""The world is getting smaller, and we have to learn how to protect our values and still meet all these challenges. And again I will say, I think the most important thing is for us to create a sense that this country can operate the way this community does, that we are neighbors, that if we believe in the same things and we're willing to show up for work tomorrow and obey the law and work hard, we've all got a role to play, we've all got a place in the American community, and we're going to build that bridge to the 21st century together."", ""I'll say again, our best days are ahead of us. The children here in this audience will have more opportunities to live out their dreams than any generation that has ever lived. They will be doing jobs, many of them that have not been invented yet. Some of them will be doing jobs that have not been imagined yet. And we have got to do those things together that make it possible for them to do it. That's the commitment I ask from you."", ""In 6 weeks and 4 days, we're going to have an election. Whether you're a Republican, a Democrat, or an independent, I'm asking you, because here you've got a reputation for being civil and neighborly and calm and talking things out. Talk to your friends and neighbors. Sit down over coffee. Talk to them when you're at work. Talk to them when you're at a civic club. Talk to them when you're at a bowling alley. Talk to them at halftime. Talk to them about what you want this country to look like as we roar into that new century and what you want this country to look like when our children are our age. If we do that, our best days are ahead, we'll make the right decision, and we'll sure enough build that bridge to the 21st century."", 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"
83,William J. Clinton ,"September 24, 1996","[""Thank you very much. Thank you, in the back, for being here. Thank you, way down under the trees, for being here. Mayor Wilson, it's great to be in Freehold. It's great to be in Monmouth County. It's great to be here with all of you."", ""I want to thank all those officials who are here—Mayor Susan Bass Levin, Mayor Cardell Cooper. Governor Florio, it's good to see you. State Chairman Tom Byrne, it's good to see you. Senator Ray Lesniak, State Senator John Lynch, all the other legislators and local leaders who are here."", ""Mayor Dave DelVecchio, thank you very much for running for the Congress and for making the stakes as clear as you have today. I know one thing, if you're representing this district in Congress in January, I believe that you will not vote for a Speaker of the House who wants to enact a contract on America, I think you will vote for the people of this district and their future. And I thank you for running."", ""I think we have some students here from the Freehold Borough Regional High School; thank you all for coming. You've got a big stake in this election, and I'm glad you're here."", ""You know, I was told this morning when I got up to come to New Jersey, after I went to the United Nations—I'll say more about that in a moment—that this magnificent monument commemorates George Washington's defeat of a British general in 1778 named Sir Henry Clinton. [Laughter] And I thought I would tell you here in the presence of these Revolutionary War reenactors who come from the Delaware Valley—and they did a great job today, let's give them a hand. [Applause] That may have happened in 1778, but in 1996, Clinton is on the right side of the battle for America's future."", ""And so is Bob Torricelli. You know, I've watched Bob Torricelli in Congress for 4 years now. I've watched him fight for legislation. I saw him sponsor legislation to require 48 hours as a minimum stay for new mothers and their newborns. He and Senator Bradley did that, and it's going to be the law of the land within about 48 more hours, I believe, when the Congress passes that. It took 4 long years, but I thank him for that."", ""I saw him sponsor legislation that I have embraced to expand the Brady bill. The Brady bill, which was also opposed by the leaders of the other party in Congress, basically says you have to wait 5 days while we do a background check before you get a handgun. Now, when we passed the Brady bill, there was all this screaming and yelling that we would be taking people's guns away. And 3 years later every hunter still has the same gun, but 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers were not able to get handguns. Bob Torricelli was right, and they were wrong. And now, he and I believe that the Brady bill ought to be modestly extended to say if you have beaten up your spouse or your child you shouldn't get a handgun, either. And I think New Jersey agrees with that."", 'I understand there\'s been a little ad running in New Jersey about Bob Torricelli\'s vote for our economic plan in 1993. ""That one vote,"" they say, ""was the biggest tax increase in history."" Of course, it wasn\'t. The biggest one in history was in 1982, under President Reagan, and he supported it and signed it. I wasn\'t around.', ""But I'll tell you this—let me tell you about that one vote. The next time you watch the ad, you see if you think it's accurate, fair, and complete. That one vote cut taxes for 5 times as many families in New Jersey as it raised taxes on. That one vote made 90 percent of the small businesses in this country eligible for a tax cut when they invest more in their business. That one vote gave people in New Jersey who wanted to take a chance on investing in a new company a tax break for doing it. That one vote cut the deficit more than any one vote in history. We've now had 4 years of a declining deficit; it's the first time that's happened since the 1840's, before the Civil War. That's what that one vote did."", 'That one vote—that one vote brought down interest rates for car payments, home payments, credit card payments, and business loans. And that one vote is a big reason that we have 10 1/2 million more jobs, the lowest unemployment rate in 7 1/2 years, a 15-year high in homeownership, record highs in small business formation and the ownership of businesses by women. Yes, that one vote was a pretty big vote. It was the right vote for America, and I hope you will remember that.', ""And I'll tell you something else about that one vote. Because we have cut the deficit from $290 billion down to $116 billion, that one vote now makes it possible for us to balance the budget without hurting Medicare, Medicaid, cutting back on education or environmental protection, and to give targeted tax cuts for childrearing, to pay for the cost of college education, to pay for health care, to pay for buying that first home, and to say to people when you sell your home with a reasonable gain, you'll never have to pay taxes on that again. That's what that one vote did. Don't forget that one vote."", 'So every time you see an ad, ""that one vote"" ought to be a paid political commercial for Bob Torricelli and everybody else who had the courage to put America\'s future over short-term demagoguery. We\'re better off today than we were 4 years ago. How could anybody dispute that?', ""My friends, 4 years ago when I came to New Jersey and asked for your support, I said I had a simple vision for our country on the edge of a new century. I wanted us to go into the 21st century with the American dream alive and well for everyone who was willing to work for it. I wanted us to go into the 21st century as a country that respected our diversity and relished it, that was coming together more closely as a community, not drifting apart as so many other nations of the world are. And I wanted us to continue to be the world's strongest nation for peace and freedom and prosperity."", 'And I say to you today the strategy we adopted, opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and a community in which every person has a role to play and a part, is working. We not only have a stronger economy, the crime rate has gone down for 4 years in a row; the welfare rolls are down by nearly 2 million; child support collections are up by $3 billion, 40 percent; there are no Russian missiles pointed at the children of the United States; and today I became the first head of state to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty to ban all nuclear tests forever.', ""Now, this did not happen by accident. These things happened because we changed the way Washington works. We got out of who's to blame, and we asked, what can we do about our problems? We invited everyone to help us. We invited everyone to put aside their partisanship, their extremism, to roll up their sleeves and tackle America's problems, seize America's opportunities. It worked. That's why we're on the right track."", 'Now, you have a great choice to make. And it has been clearly, and I must say, candidly articulated, not just by me but also by my opponent: Are we going to build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past? Are we going to say, ""You\'re on your own out there. We can\'t afford things like family leave,"" or are we going to say, ""The First Lady\'s right. It does take a village to raise our children and to build up our country.""', ""You have to make this decision. You heard what Meryl said. My distinguished opponent voted against the family leave law four times and said this year he still did the right thing, said it was bad for business. Well, you tell me how it can be bad for business. Since we adopted the family leave law, we've had 10 1/2 million new jobs, a record number of new small businesses in each and every year. I think it's good for business if people can succeed at home and they're not worried sick about their children all day long while they're at work. I think it's better for America if people are good parents. I think they're better workers, they're more productive workers, and this is a stronger country."", ""But to believe that, you have to believe that we have common responsibilities to give each other the conditions and the tools we need to make the most of our own lives. It is the big question in this election. And we have to come to grips with that. We're celebrating family leave today because 12 million times, families in America have said to their employers: I'm sorry, but I'm about to have a baby; my wife's about to have a baby; my children are sick; my parents are desperately ill; I've got to have just a little time off; I'll be back to work as quick as I can. And they didn't lose their jobs for that. Is that so bad? I think that makes us a better, stronger, more powerful country."", ""You hear people talking all the time about family values. Well, if we're going to talk about family values, shouldn't we value families? Is there anything more important in life than doing a good job of raising our children? I never go anywhere in America—never—that I don't meet families who have at least one or two examples in their own lives where they have felt the wrenching conflict between their responsibilities to their children or their parents and their responsibilities at work."", ""This is just a small step to say, in America we want people to succeed at home and at work. In America we know most parents work and most parents have to work. In single-parent or two-parent households, we just want them to be winners with their kids and winners at work. And if you give us 4 more years I'd like to see the family leave law modestly expanded. I think it would be a very good thing if parents could also take a little time off from work to go to regular meetings with their children's teachers and make regular doctor appointments with their children or their sick parents. It would make us stronger and our economy stronger."", ""All across the spectrum, if you look at what is at stake here, I offer you a bridge to the 21st century that you have to help build—no guarantees but opportunity and the challenge of responsibility and the reminder that we have to do it together. Think about our economy. If I had told you 4 years ago we'd have 10 1/2 million new jobs, a 7 1/2 -year low in unemployment, virtually no inflation, the lowest combined rates of unemployment, inflation, and home mortgages in 28 years, you'd have said that's pretty good, bring it on."", ""But we can do better. We can grow the economy faster. We can offer opportunity to those who have still not participated in the economic recovery. And now that we have passed a welfare reform law that says to poor families we'll keep guaranteeing health care and nutrition, and child care if you go to work, but now the check itself goes to the State, and communities have to devise a way to move able-bodied people to work, we have to create jobs for those people. We cannot permit the children to be hurt. We have to give their parents a chance to go to work, the same chance that all the rest of us want in life. That is what we must do. And I hope you'll help me build that bridge to the 21st century."", 'We can—let me say again—we can balance the budget, and we must. That keeps the interest rates down. That keeps your home mortgage rates, your car payments, your credit card payments, your business loan rates down. But we have to do it in a way that does not divide this country or compromise our future. That means protecting Medicare and Medicaid. It means investing in education. It means investing in environmental protection. It means investing in research and technology.', 'Let me just tell you, just in the last couple of years there have been breathtaking advances in medical research, in the treatment of people with spinal cord injuries, in breast cancer, in dealing with AIDS. The life expectancy of people with HIV has more than doubled in the last 4 years, thanks to medical research and the rapid movement of drugs to the market. Just recently, for the first time ever, a laboratory animal with a severed spinal cord had movement in its lower limbs because of nerve transplants.', 'We have got to keep investing in these things. In the nonmedical area we are about to build a supercomputer with IBM, the United States and IBM—listen to this—that will do more calculations in one second than you can go home and do on your hand-held calculator in 30,000 years.', 'The world is changing. And we owe it to the future to continue to invest in making sure that America stays at the head of the pack in new technologies, new opportunities, and new jobs for the American people and new adventures for our children. And we must do that.', 'We have to build a bridge to the 21st century that does more of what I saw in Uniontown when I visited the school there not very long ago, right here in New Jersey. I want to build a bridge to the 21st century that gives all of our children the best educational opportunities in the world. We want to hook up every classroom and every library in America to the information superhighway, to the Internet, to the World Wide Web.', 'Let me tell you what that means. It means for the first time in history, the children in the most remote rural districts and in the poorest urban districts will have access to the same information in the same way at the same quality in the same time as every other child in America.

And we propose to do it in the following way:', 'Number one, more people than ever will be able to save through an IRA and withdraw from that IRA tax-free if the savings are used to pay for college, medical care, a first-time home.', 'Number two, we\'re going to say in the next 4 years we want a community college education to be just as universal in the United States as a high school diploma is today. Everybody needs more than a high school diploma today and here\'s how we\'re going to pay for it. We want to say to working Americans, ""If you go to a community college, you can deduct from your taxes dollar for dollar the cost of tuition at a typical community college in the United States."" We can do that—no bureaucracy, no extra hassle. And we can pay for it in the balanced budget amendment.', 'And finally, we want to permit every family to deduct the cost of college tuition, any kind of college, undergraduate or graduate school, up to $10,000 a year from their taxes so that we can educate our people. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century?

I do not understand that.', ""But if you want a reason to support these two men, that's a good one. We've got the crime rate coming down 4 years in a row.

They should not have guns. Torricelli was right: 4 more years, and we'll get that done. I hope that you will help us to do things, in short, that will say to the American people, we want everybody to be more responsible."", ""Finally, let me say we need to prove that we can go forward together as one community. A big part of that is the family support system we talked about, family and medical leave. Something else I'd like to see done—a lot of our people today have to work and want to work to get overtime. A lot of people have to do it just to keep their jobs. I'd like to see more options for the workers to take some of that overtime if they want to, and it's best for the family, in time at home with their kids and their parents instead of pay if they decide that's what they need to keep their families together."", 'We have to look for new and exciting and innovative and different ways to grow this economy and support families as they meet the struggles and the challenges of the 21st century.', ""The last point I want to make about that is that perhaps nothing defines us so clearly in terms of our commitment to going forward together as whether we're committed to a clean environment for all of our people. I'm proud of the fact that since this administration has been in office, millions of people are breathing cleaner air; we passed a safe drinking water bill; we passed a pesticide protection act; we modernized the meat inspection standards for the first time in seven decades."", ""We have added to the national park system and protected our most precious national treasures, and we cleaned up more toxic waste sites in 3 years than the previous administrations did in 12. But I am not proud of the fact that there are still 10 million American children living within 4 miles of a toxic waste site. That is wrong. And if you give us 4 more years, we intend to clean up the 500 worst sites so we can say America's children are growing up next to parks, not poison. Every child in America is entitled to that, and I want you to help us build that bridge to the 21st century."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, I have loved being here today. I'm sorry that some distant ancestor of mine strayed in the Revolutionary War, probably was just being loyal to where he was born. But 200 years later, I'm mighty proud to be here with you, proud to be representing the people of New Jersey, grateful for the support you have given me, and asking you to think among yourselves not about party, not about politics, but about what you want our country to look like when we start a new century in a new millennium, and what you want America to be like when your children are your age. That is all that matters."", ""I believe, as strongly as I can say, that if you want the kind of America I believe you do, we've got to build a bridge to the future. We can revere our past, but we can't recapture it. The best days of America are still ahead."", ""The children in this audience today, many of them will do jobs that have not been invented yet. Some of them will do work that has not been imagined yet. All we have to do is to build the right kind of bridge that's broad enough, big enough, and strong enough for all of us to walk across. I hope you will help me build it."", 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"
84,William J. Clinton ,"September 25, 1996","[""Thank you so much. Thank you, Secretary Rubin. First let me start with first things first. Thank all of you for showing up and thank you for your enthusiasm and your warm welcome. It's good to be back in western Pennsylvania. Thank you."", 'Thank you, Secretary Rubin, for your great leadership on economic policy and for your remarks here today. Thank you, Congressman Frank Mascara, for representing the people of western Pennsylvania so well and for being what we need more of in Washington, a genuine gentleman and an honest public servant who really cares about the people here. Thank you very much.', ""Thank you, Tony Gliozzo, for your fine remarks. I wish you well. I'd let you be President if you'd let me be 22 again. [Laughter] I'd take my chances. [Laughter] I was talking to Tony about his studies here at Robert Morris, his career ambitions. Every time I have a chance to meet with young people in America it reinforces my faith about our future, and I thank you for being up here with us today."", ""I'm delighted to be joined by Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy and Allegheny County Commissioner Mike Dawida. Thank you both for being here. And there are a lot of others here—I don't want to get into a name-calling contest even in a positive way, but I want to thank my good friend, the former mayor of Pittsburgh, Sophie Maslaw, for being here; and George Becker, the president of the United Steelworkers, thank you, George, for being here. Ron DiNicola is here. I thank you all for being here. And Dr. Nicholson, thank you for welcoming us to Robert Morris, sir. We're delighted to be here."", 'I never had a bad day in western Pennsylvania. I always love coming here. But I know that for many people this is a sad day in the Pittsburgh area because Jim Leyland is managing his last home game for the Pirates today. And after 11 years and three division championships, a man who worked hard and never tried to grab the credit, and built a quiet reputation as one of the best people in baseball, let me just say I admire him, and I wish him the best. And I know all of you do, too.', 'As has already been said by Tony, Robert Morris was one of the most important financiers of our American Revolution. He was the first budget balancer, also. He actually resigned from the Continental Congress in 1778 because he thought they were printing too much worthless money. And because of his own economic achievements, he was really one of the founders of the remarkable American economy, which has sustained us and become the envy of the world over 220 years.', 'All of you here who are students and teachers and who work in other ways at Robert Morris are carrying on that spirit by studying business and working hard to prepare yourselves for the remarkable opportunities of the 21st century.', 'Today I want to talk to you for a few minutes about the subject that Secretary Rubin mentioned, how we can provide greater opportunities for Americans to save, to increase investment growth and personal security. And I want to do it in the context of how we can build a bridge to the 21st century with a strong American economy that every person who is willing to work hard has a fair chance to participate in and to benefit from.', 'Four years ago, just before the Presidential election, I came to Pittsburgh, just about 4 days before the election, and said that I had entered that campaign because, and I\'d like to quote, ""I didn\'t want my daughter to grow up to be part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than her parents, because I knew we could do better with more opportunity and more responsibility and a stronger American community."" Well, today I\'m here to tell you that I\'m not worried about that anymore because America is on the right track and our children are going to do better.', 'Four years ago our economy was stalled: New job growth was the slowest since the Depression, wages had been stagnant for half the work force for nearly two decades, our working people were becoming more divided economically, the deficit was at an all-time high, the debt had been quadrupled, cynicism was rising, our people were working harder and harder just to keep up. I was determined to give us a new direction.', 'We put in place the comprehensive economic strategy that Secretary Rubin discussed. It was, quite simply: cut the deficit, open more markets to American goods and services and investment, invest in education, invest in new technologies and research, protect the environment in a way that grows the economy and creates the opportunities of tomorrow. And do it in a way that keeps the American people coming together, not drifting apart.', ""Now, we are moving in the right direction. Unemployment has been cut by a third; it's the lowest it's been in 7 1/2 years. The combined rates of unemployment, inflation, and mortgages are the lowest in 28 years. Our economy has produced 10 1/2 million new jobs, about 200,000 of them, just under 200,000 here in Pennsylvania. Our auto industry leads the world again, producing and selling more cars than Japanese automakers for the first time since the 1970's, something I'm proud of."", ""In each of the last 3 years—we don't have the '96 figures yet, but in '93, '94, and '95, we set new records in the exports of American products and new records in the formation of new small businesses. Now 8 million businesses are owned by women in America, an all-time high."", 'Homeownership is at a 15-year high. And in the industries that will dominate the new century, from semiconductors to airlines, America is leading the way. Of the new jobs created in the last 3 1/2 years, more than half of them are in high-wage industries. That also breaks a pattern of the recent past; more of our new jobs are good jobs. And after falling for a decade, real hourly wages, the thing that shows up in the paycheck of the average worker— those wages are finally starting to rise again.', ""In addition to that, inflation in health care costs is finally coming down, nearer the rate of inflation of the economy as a whole. Last year it was just under 4 percent, a 23-year low. This year in the first 6 months, it's running at about 2 percent per year and could actually finish below the overall rate of inflation for the first time in anyone's memory."", ""So I say to you the country is moving in the right direction. But Pittsburgh and America's industrial heartland are also rebuilding. Over the past 4 years, the unemployment rate has dropped by a third, to 5 percent, slightly under the national average. Today, 2,400 high-tech companies employ over 90,000 people in the Pittsburgh area. Thousands of more manufacturing companies use high-tech and employee creativity to make old products in new ways. With specialty steel, biotech computer software, and environmental technologies, Pittsburgh will be the heart of America's 21st century economy."", 'Now, it pleases me greatly to see our country and this community and this area moving on the right track to the 21st century with confidence and conviction. But there is more to do, and we must press forward. We can do better, and we must if we want to give all Americans who are willing to work for it the chance to benefit from economic opportunity and if we want to grow faster so that living standards can keep rising again after being stagnant for nearly 20 years for too many of our fellow Americans.', ""What else can we do? Well, let's take first things first. You heard what Secretary Rubin said. More than ever before, the private sector is the engine of economic growth. I am very proud that 93 percent of the new jobs created in America in the last 4 years have been in the private sector. That is the highest percentage in a very long time. I am proud of that."", ""We've downsized the Government by about 250,000. It's the smallest it's been now since John Kennedy was President. As a percentage of the civilian work force, your Federal Government is the smallest it's been since 1933 when Franklin Roosevelt took the oath of office. We have not done this with big Government programs; we've done it with targeted, strategic policies working with the private sector to grow this economy. And we have to continue."", ""You heard what Secretary Rubin said about the conditions of growth. When we cut the deficit by 60 percent—and I might add, this will be the first time that an administration has cut the deficit in all 4 years of its term since John Tyler was President of the United States in the 1840's, before the Civil War."", ""For all of you here who have been so supportive of me, I have to tell you, the bad news is John Tyler was not reelected. [Laughter] But it was still a good thing that he did. And it's too bad it took 150 years to do it again. I'm determined to keep going until we balance the budget and do it in the right way."", 'Now, I want to take just a minute to talk about this because I have to tell you, back in Washington, where political consultants tell politicians what will or won\'t sell out in the country, every political consultant says, ""Don\'t talk about balancing the budget. It only works when the economy is bad. When people think the economy is good, balancing the budget is boring. Nobody wants to hear about it.""', 'But you have to understand, the economy is better because we cut the deficit, which meant the Government borrowed less, which meant you could borrow more at lower interest rates. And we have to keep trying to balance the budget so that we can keep interest rates down on home mortgages, car loans, credit card payments, and most importantly, on business loans so business can afford to invest, to create new jobs, to create greater productivity, to strengthen the pay, the security, the incomes, and the future of their workers and their families. That is what is at issue here.', 'We now would have a balanced budget for the last 2 years, indeed, we would have a surplus today if it weren\'t for the interest we are paying on only the debt run up in the 12 years before I took office. We had a radical departure from America\'s history of fiscal responsibility in those 12 years. And we quadrupled the national debt. My senior Senator from Arkansas, where I\'m from, Dale Bumpers, said, ""Well, you can understand that. You can have a good time on $200 billion worth of hot checks. But sooner or later the bills come due.""', ""And the bills came due to us in higher interest rates, slower growth, stagnant wages. And we paid and we paid and we paid. So by bringing the deficit down in a dramatic and sustained way, we were able to get interest rates down, which put money directly back in the pockets of ordinary Americans and enabled us to grow more rapidly and grow together more. That's why I say we have to finish the job, because we want to keep the interest rates down and we want to have growth without inflation."", ""But we have to do it in the right way. We actually have some fundamental responsibilities as a nation that we can best meet together. That's the Government's role and our partnership. Yes, we have to make sure that we extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund. I agree with that and I have proposed savings to achieve that. But we should not break up Medicare, turn it into a second-class system, treat the oldest, the poorest, and the most ill of our senior citizens in an unfair way. The Medicare program has the lowest administrative costs of any insurance program, health insurance program, in the United States, public or private. It works well and we should not destroy it."", ""We should not, in my view, endanger the national commitment we made 30 years ago to provide health care not only to poor but largely to middle class families through the Medicaid program, helping seniors into nursing homes, helping poor pregnant women and poor little children, and among the most important things, helping families who have family members with disabilities to keep working and care for their family members with disabilities so that they could go together and maintain a middle class lifestyle. I believe that would be a mistake, and it's not necessary to balance the budget."", ""I also don't think we should sacrifice our future. We shouldn't cut our investments in education, in environmental protection, in research and technology. We need more investments in research and technology. But we can balance the budget and still continue to invest an appropriate amount there."", ""We can also balance the budget and have a tax cut, but it has to be one that is paid for line by line and dime by dime. We heard before—that's how we got into this mess—we heard before that we would grow our way into paying for a tax cut that no one thought we could grow our way into paying for. Now, the tax cut that I have proposed is a targeted tax cut for families that need it, for child-rearing, for education, for health care costs, for homebuying and for selling a home without having to pay taxes on the gain from the sale, a $500-per-child tax credit, individual retirement accounts you can withdraw from without penalty for education, health costs, and first-time homebuying, a capital gains exemption for $500,000 on the gain of a sale of a home, and that goes with what we have already done, which is to double the earned-income tax credit for lower-income working people. It's worth about $1,000 in lower taxes today than would have been the case in 1993 for a family of four with an income of $28,000 a year or less. It was a big tax cut for about 15 million American families."", ""We made a hundred percent of the small businesses in this country eligible for a tax cut if they invest more money in their business by taking the expensing provision from $10,000 to $25,000 a year. We made the self-employed people who buy their own health insurance eligible for a tax cut by taking the premium deductibility from 30—we're moving it up to 80 percent of the cost of their premiums. And we had a small business capital gains investment: If you invest in a new or growing small business and hold the investment for 5 years, you only owe half the normal tax rate."", ""So these things together, every one of them, is paid for in the context of a balanced budget. And I will say again, I believe it is imperative, we dare not go back to telling people we can give them something that cannot be paid for. It may be popular, but it isn't the right thing to do. We ought to have those things that we know we can pay for in the context of keeping the interest rates down."", ""That's the big difference in me and my opponent and those who support the $550-billion across-the-board big tax cut with no idea how it's going to be paid for. I can tell you how it will have to be paid for. Ask the Congressman; don't take my word for it. Ask the Secretary of the Treasury. It will be paid for in two ways. One is, we'll have even bigger cuts in Medicaid, Medicare, education, and the environment than the ones I vetoed, and it still won't be enough to pay for, so the deficit will go up anyway, and that means interest rates will go up."", ""Last year, a Republican economist put out a paper I agree with—I agree with. Just last year they said if we did not have a plan to move toward a balanced budget that was credible in the financial markets it would add 2 percent to the interest rates of every American family and every American business. That's what they said, not me. So you can go home and figure it out. How would it affect you if your credit card payment, your home mortgage payment, your car payment went up 2 percent? Even worse, how would it affect this area after we have worked so hard to finally come out of the devastation of the collapse of the old economy here and to build a new economy if all business loans were 2 percent more expensive."", ""What would that do to the creation of new jobs? What would it do to Mr. Becker's steel worker members attempting to maintain their lifestyle, their wages, their health care benefits, their retirement, to be productive in a hotly contested global economy for steel? We cannot do that. We dare not do that."", ""So I ask you again to say, let's balance the budget. That's the first thing. Let's do it in a way that maintains our common obligations, and let's have a tax cut, but only let's have a tax cut we can pay for that will grow the economy and support strong families, targeted to childrearing, to education, to the essentials of family life, including health care costs and homebuying. That will make America stronger, it will grow the economy faster and keep us moving in the right direction."", ""Let me just mention two other things. We have to continue to work to open more markets to America's products and services. Exports have surged by one-third in the last 3 years to a record level, but this is now the most productive economy in the world, and there are still too many markets that are closed to us, while we have the most open market in the world. We have made over 200 separate trade agreements, 21 with Japan."", ""If you think those things don't matter, let me just give you one statistic. In the 21 areas where we have actually made trade agreements with Japan, our exports have gone up by 85 percent in 3 years. We need more of that. We have to open these markets around the world to the work being done here in western Pennsylvania by our people."", 'The third thing we have to do, I want to emphasize it again, is we have to continue to stay on the cutting edge of change. You should support an investment of an appropriate amount of your tax dollars in research and technology, because that is the key to our future. Let me give you some examples that I think you can all identify with.', ""The human genome project at the National Institutes of Health, also being supported in universities all across America, will one day in the not-too-distant future enable every set of parents that has a little baby to get a map of the genetic structure of their child. So if their child has a predisposition to a certain kind of illness or a certain kind of problem, or even to heart disease or stroke in the early forties, they will be able to plan that child's life, that child's upbringing to minimize the possibility of the child developing that illness or that predisposition, to organize the diet plan, the exercise plan, the medical treatment that would enable untold numbers of people to have far more full lives than would have been the case before. It will also create huge numbers of new, fascinating, high-wage jobs that have not even been invented yet for people like the young people who go to Robert Morris."", 'Example number two, closer to the present day. Medical research, funding new medicines, and a dramatic speeding-up of the approval of the drug process at the FDA have led to a more than doubling of the life expectancy of people with HIV in only 4 years—more than doubling the life expectancy of people with HIV and AIDS in just 4 years.', 'Example 3. A lot of you heard Christopher Reeve speak at the Democratic Convention, and he talked about more research. He said we need more research. Just a few days before he spoke, for the first time ever, a laboratory animal with a severed spine had movement in its lower limbs because of nerve transplants. This had never been done before. We are moving in the right direction. That can change the future of America.', ""I'll just give you one last example, because it always knocks people out. We just signed a joint project with IBM and the Federal Government to produce a supercomputer in the next couple of years that will do more calculations in one second than you can go home and do on your hand-held calculator in 30,000 years."", 'I say it to make this point: Every time an election comes around, somebody will say, ""Well, this is all your money."" It is all your money, but you can\'t invest in that kind of supercomputer by yourself, and even businesses, individually, can\'t afford to do that. These are things societies must do together in common, making common commitments. And it\'s good for you that we\'re doing this. It will open up new frontiers of health and quality of life, it will open new frontiers of human knowledge, and we will be thrilled by what we learn.', ""We're sending this robotic mission to Mars, two of them, by the end of the year. I can tell you that our space program, every single year, is reaping untold benefits in what we are learning about the technology to deal with our environmental problems here on Earth and what we're learning from the weightlessness of human bodies about how to deal with health care challenges. So this is an important part of our economic strategy for the future."", ""We also have to give families a way of dealing with all of these changes. You know, people's job security is different than it used to be. And since more and more people are being employed by small businesses and the pension plans are changing—more of them, from defined benefits into the future to specific contribution requirements—and since more and more people are—in the last 10 years have been employed in businesses where they didn't have guaranteed health plans, if you think about what it takes to succeed at home and succeed at work, we need to create a work environment where working people who are productive have access to affordable health care and access to a good retirement program, and they can carry those things with them when they move from job to job if they have to move from job to job. And they need the ability to get educated for a lifetime. That is also very important."", ""We just passed the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill in Washington which makes 25 million Americans more eligible for health care by saying that you can't be denied health insurance anymore when you move from job to job, or just because somebody in your family has been sick; that's what insurance is for in the first place. That's a huge improvement."", ""This week, Congress is passing legislation to guarantee at least 48 hours in the hospital for new mothers and their babies—big issue. Our balanced budget plan contains a provision paid for in the balanced budget to help people keep their health insurance for six months when they're between jobs. That could help up to 700,000 kids a year—5 million Americans are changing jobs, all the time, at any given time. It's an important issue."", ""Next week, actually Tuesday, to be precise, 10 millions of hard-working Americans will get a pay raise when the minimum wage law goes into effect. Something that isn't quite as well known is that we also, in that bill, passed most of the pension provisions that were sought by the White House Conference on Small Business and the American small business community which will make it much easier for small businesses and self-employed people to take out pensions and for small businesses to take out pension plans for themselves and their employees, and then for people to move them seamlessly when they move from job to job. Secretary Rubin's done a lot of work on that. That's a big deal for people who work in small business and who need it; it's very, very important."", ""One last thing that I've not succeeded in passing in 4 years, but I'm going to keep banging away at it until someday I find a Congress that likes the idea as much as I do—we have today in America a wonderful network of training. We have good vocational schools; we have good specialty schools; we have a world-class network of community colleges; we have good general universities; we have great colleges like Robert Morris that specialize in certain things. This is an incredible thing we have, this resource."", ""And when people need it, they're smart enough to figure out what they need, I believe. That's the reason these institutions are open. If nobody had enough sense to come to them, they would shut down, right? I mean, by definition, our people—they figure out what's best for them."", 'Well, over time, we have developed 70 or more separate specific Federal job training programs that were all passed for the best of motives. They all really had a good purpose. But now, they\'re just different programs in different categories. And for 4 years, I have been trying, and I\'m going to keep trying, to get Congress to get rid of all of these separate categories of programs and create a simple ""G.I. bill"" for America\'s workers, and say to people, if you lose your job and you need new training to get a new job and a better one, or if you\'re grossly underemployed and you\'re eligible because you\'re underemployed and you\'re earning very low wages to go back and get Federal job training help, we\'ll just send you a certificate, it will be your skills grant. It will be your ""G.I. bill"" that says you get $2,500, take it where you want to take it. Take it to Robert Morris, take it to the community college, take it to the vocational school. You decide. It will help you.', ""So these are the things that I believe we need to do to help. Just one other thing I think is very important, and I know I'm preaching to the saved here because you're all here. But we have got to raise the skill level of the American work force generally. It means higher standards in our schools. It means more access to computer technology. It means a lot of things. But it certainly means making access to college universal in America. Everybody who wants to go and is willing to work ought to be able to go."", ""And let me say, my proposals on that include the direct loan program we've already put in which lowers the costs of college loans and says you can pay them back as a percentage of your income; the AmeriCorps program, which has given 50,000 young people a way to pay for college by serving in their communities."", 'But we want to do three things, three more things that will make a big difference. Number one, say that families with joint incomes of up to $100,000 can save in an IRA, withdraw from it tax-free if the money goes to a college education for their kids. Number two, make at least a community college education as universal by the year 2000 as a high school diploma is today by simply saying—this requires no program— all we have to say is, if you want to go to get 2 more years of college, we will let you deduct, dollar for dollar off your tax bill, the cost of a typical community college tuition up to $1,500 a year, strict reduction off your tax bill for the costs of going back for the first 2 years. And I think that is important. And finally, something that would help virtually every family represented at Robert Morris College here. I believe that the cost of any education after high school, the tuition costs, up to $10,000 a year, ought to be tax deductible—any education.', ""All of that is paid for in our balanced budget plan. It would make America stronger. It would make America stronger, and it would help individual families. We also need, I think, to do more to give families more options to save for their other purposes, and that's what I wanted to talk to you about in some specific detail today."", ""Today, America's families have a wide choice of opportunities to save, but we want to give them one more that will give them greater investment security. I'm grateful today that inflation is low. Inflation has been under 3 percent for 3 years in a row for the first time since the 1960's, and I am grateful for that. But I also remember well the 1970's and the early eighties when inflation was high."", 'Last spring we announced that we would work to issue a new kind of security to protect investors from inflation, to encourage long-term savings. We asked for public response to this idea. We got it, and it was overwhelmingly positive. So today, we announced a new way to save: an inflation protection bond. It will allow middle-class families to protect their savings from inflation no matter what. These bonds will first be issued on January 15th. They will be available in denominations as low as $1,000, the value of the principal will increase as necessary over the years to keep up with inflation, and they will pay interest on the principal adjusted for inflation. Not a penny of value will ever be lost to anyone who buys them because of inflation at whatever rate inflation occurs.', ""For investors who choose these bonds, there will not be paper gains, there will be real gains, and this is a real incentive for families to save for their own future and for their children's. I'm thinking about this a lot now because of my own situation, because our daughter is going off to college next year. We started saving for that a long time ago. If you want to save now for a newborn baby's college education, you can do it and know that no matter what happens to inflation over the next 18 years, it will not erode your investment. You will be able to make that savings good in your child's life."", ""If you want to start saving for a home, these bonds will enable you to start saving now without worrying about inflation. If you want to save for retirement or if you're already retired, the bonds will guarantee a lifetime of savings as solid as the word of the Treasury. Inflation protection bonds can be a solid rock upon which families build their futures and their dreams."", 'We also want to do two other things to help families save. Within a year, the Treasury Department will issue inflation-protected savings bonds, things that young people can buy, bonds in denominations as small as $50 that employers will be able to offer through their payroll deduction plans. And we want to make it even easier to save for training and education after high school.', ""Today, the interest payments on savings bonds for many families are exempt if the money is used to pay for college. In the minimum wage legislation I signed, we expanded the number of families that can get that break, and today I want to ask Congress to do more. They should be available to pay not only for college education but for vocational education, and while you have to be 24 years old to get this break today, parents of any age should be able to start as soon as they want to save for their children. We should encourage savings by all Americans and get rid of all the impediments to it. We're going to have to save more as individuals, as families, and as a nation. If we want to invest more and be more productive in the future, these actions today will help us to achieve that goal."", ""I thank you, Secretary Rubin, for what you've done to achieve that."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, all of these actions are part of a strategy that I've called building a bridge to the 21st century, big enough, strong enough, wide enough for everybody to walk across. I believe very strongly that our best days are still ahead; I believe that the young people in this audience today will have more chances to live out their dreams and live up to their God-given potential than any generation of Americans ever has if we will meet the challenges, deal with the problems, and protect our traditional values that have kept America around here for 220 years."", 'These young people are going to be doing work that has not been invented yet; some of them will be doing things that have not been imagined yet. But it will still be America; it will be wonderful; and it will be better than ever if we do the right things today.', 'Thank you. Thank you very much.']"

I wish I could be there with you to thank you in person, but I'm glad to have this opportunity to speak to you by satellite. You're out there in Chicago, a city that has always stood for the strength and drive of our working people, and a city that was awfully good to our Democrats just a couple of weeks ago."", ""I want to thank my good friend, your president, George Kourpias, for all of his hard work and support. George rode with me on the train to Chicago, and I enjoyed that very much, and I missed him on Labor Day. We usually spend that together, too. I'll see you soon, George."", ""I also want to thank Don Wharton, your secretary-treasurer, and the entire executive council of the IAM. You're all doing a great job. The International Association of Machinists has been going strong for 108 years now, and I congratulate you on your plans to unify IAM with two other great unions, the United Steel Workers and the United Auto Workers."", ""By the year 2000 when we start that new century, you will be the largest union in North America. And with leaders like George Kourpias, Steve Yokich, and George Becker, I don't have any doubt at all that soon you'll be the largest in the entire world."", 'I want to talk to you today for a few minutes about the choice our country is facing in just 40 days, a choice that will determine whether we build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past, whether we can build a bridge to the 21st century that is strong enough and wide enough for every American to walk across.', 'Just 4 years ago, our economy was stalled with high unemployment, the slowest job growth since the Great Depression, a record budget deficit, stagnant wages, increasing inequality, rampant cynicism. Our workers were becoming more divided economically, and it seemed that Americans were working harder and harder just to keep up.', ""I took office with a simple strategy: Opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and bring us all together in a great American community again. That's America's basic bargain. We didn't ask who is to blame; instead, we asked what can we do. And our strategy has worked. Today, we have further evidence of just how well it is working."", 'According to the Census Bureau just today, we have had the largest decline in the last year in income inequality in 27 years, the largest decline in the number of Americans living in poverty in 27 years.', ""Since our economic plan passed, family incomes are up over $1,600. In the last year, after inflation, average incomes are up about $900. That's the biggest jump in a decade. Now, these are remarkable turnarounds from a condition that many people thought was inevitable, from America growing apart, to America growing together as we go forward together. And that's just today's news."", ""In the past 4 years, we've cut unemployment by a third to its lowest level in 7 1/2 years. The combined rates of unemployment and inflation and home mortgages are the lowest in nearly 30 years. Our economy has produced 10 1/2 million new jobs, 4.4 million new homeowners. We've cut the deficit by 60 percent, given 15 million of our hardest working American families a tax cut. And now we're going to help 25 million Americans get the quality health care access they need by saying, in the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, you can no longer have your insurance taken away from you when you move from job to job, and you can't be denied coverage simply because someone in your family has been sick."", ""The U.S. aerospace industry, which is so critical to our country and its future, is on the rebound in a big way. Last year, American aerospace companies captured a record 83 percent of the world market for large commercial aircraft. I am committed to supporting the aerospace industry and the hundreds of thousands of good jobs it produces. That's why our administration will continue to promote our aerospace industry and our exports all around the world, just the way the late Ron Brown and Secretary Mickey Kantor and I have done for the last 4 years."", ""I know that many of you have been affected by defense downsizing. That's why we've done what we could to ease the transition by developing new applications for defense technology and working to create employment opportunities for former defense workers. Over the past 4 years, we've also fought to protect our own values, the ones you and I share."", 'Yes, we do have to balance the budget; it keeps interest rates down and the economy growing. But when the Republican Congress tried to pass devastating cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment, I stopped them. Then, they shut down the Government twice to try to force their cuts on the American people, and together, we said no again.', ""Because we want to strengthen families, we fought for the Family and Medical Leave Act. Because we honor our parents, we worked to secure the pensions of 40 million working and already retired people. And we stopped the Republicans from letting their corporations raid their workers' pension plans again in their budget. We learned our lesson in the eighties; we don't want to do that again."", 'And because we honor work and family, we were right to raise the minimum wage for 10 million American workers. Next Tuesday, because of that victory, those 10 million American workers will get their raise. It was a long and difficult fight, but when many of our hardest pressed citizens get a raise on Tuesday, I know you will agree it was worth it.', ""And I want to pay a special word of tribute to the IAM and to the labor movement in general for its fight for this increase. I know your members don't earn the minimum wage, but you fought for it, anyway, because you know how important it is for people who are working hard to support their children and to be productive citizens and to stay off welfare, to be able to be rewarded and to have dignity in their work. So I thank you; you did a great thing for our country."", ""We all know that America is on the right track to the 21st century, but we've got more to do. I want to build a bridge to the next century where every American family has a chance to benefit from the growing economy, a chance to succeed at home with their children, and to succeed at work."", 'We should expand the Family and Medical Leave Act to give parents a little time off to take their children to the doctor and to parentteacher conferences. We ought to make the first 2 years of college as universal as high school is today by giving families tax cuts to pay for college tuition. I know that will help a lot of you.', ""I've proposed a $1,500 tax credit for tuition, a dollar-for-dollar reduction from your tax bill, for the first 2 years of college. That's the typical cost of tuition at a community college. And I've proposed a $10,000 tax deduction for any tuition after high school for people of any age. We also want to expand IRA's so that families can save for college and then withdraw from the IRA, tax-free, to pay for those college costs or for a medical emergency or to buy a first home."", 'I also want to streamline the training programs that have been passed to benefit America\'s workers who are unemployed or underemployed. I\'ve proposed a ""GI bill"" for America\'s workers that will tell every worker in America: If you lose your job or you\'re underemployed and you qualify for a Federal training program, we\'ll give you a skill grant worth up to $2,600 a year, and you figure out where you want to take it, to get the training you most need to go on to a better job. I don\'t want anybody left behind or stuck in this global economy; I want us to go forward together.', ""We also had a good day for health care here in the Nation's Capital. We said that there are not going to be any more drive-by deliveries, that insurance companies can't force mothers and their newborn babies out of the hospital in just a day, in some cases up to 8 hours. We began to take some steps to provide some parity for families that have members with mental health problems, which I think is terribly important. And we said to the Vietnam veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange and whose children, therefore, were born with the terrible disease of spina bifida, we're going to give you the support and the help you deserve. These things, plus Kennedy-Kassebaum, mean we're moving in the right direction."", ""Now, we've got to take the next step on health care. My balanced budget plan would provide for support for people who are between jobs so they can keep their health insurance for 6 months. That will help 5 million Americans a year, up to 700,000 children a year. And I know you're for that, and I ask you to keep working with me until we make sure that health care is accessible and affordable to all American working families."", ""Now, that's how we'll build our bridge to the 21st century, doing everything we can to strengthen and support working American families. Soon after I took office, I got rid of my predecessor's anti-worker, anti-union Executive orders. Our administration is pro-family, proworker, and pro-union. I strongly support collective bargaining. It is not a privilege, it's the right of all of our workers."", ""The recent resolution of the McDonnell-Douglas contract dispute at the bargaining table is a great example of why we have to preserve that right always. And we're glad to have you back at work. I want you to know I'll keep standing up for working Americans. Congress tried to make our workplaces less safe and company unions the law of the land, but I wouldn't let them. Congress tried to gut the National Labor Relations Board and undermine the prevailing wage laws, and I said no."", ""We can have a stronger economy without sacrificing workers' rights, workers' job security, and safe workplaces. And I will keep fighting to protect striking workers from being permanently replaced. I will also continue to use my veto pen to stop Republicans in Congress from attacking our working families and the unions that represent them. Our unequaled progress throughout the entire 20th century would simply not have been possible without the unions that helped to make it happen. I know I can count on you to help me build that bridge to the 21st century."", ""Our best days are still ahead of us, but we have to do everything we possibly can to make that promise real for all Americans. And as we do, we'll all be better off."", ""So, for the next 40 days, go out and tell your friends what president Kourpias told you. Your vote matters more than ever, for the Presidential race, for the fight to elect good people to Congress, for your future, your children's future, and the future of America."", 'Thank you, God bless you all, and on to victory.']"
86,William J. Clinton ,"September 27, 1996","['The President. Thank you. Thank you.', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. Thank you very much. Folks, I would have come all the way to Longview just to see the Rangerettes and hear the Ranger Band. Thank you very much. I thank you for coming out on a little bit of an overcast day and keeping the rain away. I feel like the Sun shines on us in Longview today, don't you? [Applause]"", ""Thank you, Martha Whitehead, for being a great mayor, a great State treasurer, for keeping your campaign commitment and working yourself right out of a job. Somehow I think that people will think you're entitled to a lot more good jobs in the future. Thank you for your leadership. Thank you, county commissioner James Johnson, for being here. Thank you, Ann Richards, for your wonderful talk. I heard it in the back. Thank you, Texas Democratic Party chair and former Deputy Secretary of the Department of Energy Bill White. He did a great job for us in Washington, and he's doing a great job for the Democratic Party here in Texas. And thank you, Garry Mauro, my friend of many years, for standing up for us, sticking with us, and waiting around until we finally got to the point where we can win in the State of Texas because we've done a good job for the people of Texas."", ""I also want to thank Max Sandlin for being here and for speaking earlier. And I want to ask you to send him to the United States Congress. We've got some great candidates in this part of Texas running for their first terms in Congress: Max Sandlin, Jim Turner, John Pouland. I hope they will all win. I hope you will help them so they can help you build that bridge to the 21st century that we've been talking about."", ""Thank you, Judge Frank Maloney, for being here. And ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to take a little personal privilege here and ask your retiring Congressman, Jim Chapman, who has served you well and worked hard, just to come up here and say one word. This is the biggest crowd he'll see in Longview until he leaves office, and I want him to have a chance to say hello to you. Come on up here, Jim."", '[At this point, Representative Jim Chapman made brief remarks.]', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', 'The President. Thank you. Thank you.', ""Ladies and gentlemen, 4 years ago I had a pretty tough time here. I ran for President against two guys from Texas. [Laughter] It hardly seemed fair to me. I'm sure I spent more time in Texas than anybody else who had run for President recently. And you were very good to me. We had a good showing here. I've had an opportunity to come back to Texas many times in the last 4 years, and I want to thank all those who have been my friends and supporters through good times and bad."", ""You know, we had some tough decisions to make when I became President. But think what this country was like 4 years ago. We had high unemployment, the slowest job growth since the Great Depression, growing inequality because working people's wages were stagnant. The crime rate was going up. The welfare rolls were going up. The country was becoming more divided, and people were becoming more skeptical, even cynical, about our politics. And I believed it was because we did not have a unifying vision to take us into the 21st century."", ""And I have a simple, straightforward idea of what I want this country to look like in 4 years when we start a new century and a new millennium. In Longview, Texas, and every town like it all across America, I want the American dream to be alive and well for everybody who is willing to work for it, without regard to where they start out in life. I want this country to be the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity, because our peace and our freedom and our prosperity depends upon America's ability to lead and stand up for those things in the world. And I wanted us to be a country that's coming together, not being torn apart by our differences. And I believe we can all say we're a lot better off by that standard today than we were 4 years ago. We're on the right track for the 21st century. We've done it by trying to meet our challenges and protect our values with a simple little strategy: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community that treats everybody fairly and gives everybody a role to play."", 'Now, you look at the results and you think about the tough times in 1993 and 1994. When we were passing our economic plan, Mr. Morales\' opponent said, ""If the President\'s plan passes, unemployment will go up, the deficit will go up, we\'ll have a terrible recession."" That\'s what he said. Well, now we know. A trained economist, they say. Four years later we have 10 1/2 million new jobs, 900,000 here in Texas; the lowest unemployment rate in America in 7 1/2 years; the lowest unemployment rate here in 15 years; in every single year a record number of new small businesses; the highest rate of homeownership in 15 years; 4 1/2 million new homeowners.', ""And yesterday, in the annual report of the United States Census Bureau on how we're doing as a country in terms of our income, we got the following information. Last year, median—that's the people in the middle, direct middle, not the average, the people in the middle—median household income last year increased by almost $900 after inflation, the biggest increase in family income in 10 years. Family income since that economic plan passed has gone up over $1,600."", 'And even more important, more of us who are working are sharing in it. We had the biggest decline in the inequality of incomes and the biggest decline in the number of working Americans living in poverty in 27 years, from one year to the next. We had the biggest decline in the number of children living in poverty in 20 years. We are on the right track, and we need to stay on that track to the 21st century.', ""We have increased education opportunities, from more children in Head Start to a better, lower cost college loan program, to the AmeriCorps program to allow young people to work their way through college by serving in their communities. We're moving in the right direction."", ""The crime rate has gone down for 4 years in a row because of those 100,000 police Ann Richards was talking about. And when they told all the hunters in east Texas that the President was trying to take their guns away when the Brady bill passed, it sounded pretty good at the time, and we took a terrible licking in a lot of places in 1994. You would have thought I was going to knock on the doors myself and take people's guns away. Well, guess what? Now we know. Now we know. Two hunting seasons have come and gone. It turns out that I was telling the truth. When we took the 19 assault weapons off the street we protected 650 kinds of hunting weapons. So 2 years later not a single hunter in Texas has lost their rifle. But 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers could not get handguns because of the Brady bill."", ""So the crime rate went down. The welfare rolls are down by nearly 2 million in America. Child support collections are up by almost 50 percent—nearly $4 billion a year more in child support collections. That's helping to move people off welfare and give families dignity and reinforce the responsibility of everyone to support their children. We are moving in the right direction."", ""And you know, when I ran for President— and I liked what Martha said. You know, she literally reinvented government. She consolidated her job. I heard our friends in the other party, they always said the Federal Government is a terrible thing. It's nothing but waste. It would mess up a one-car parade. And they made a living—they owned the White House for decades, you know, just kicking the Federal Government around. They hated it so much, but they couldn't bear to be outside of it. It kind of tickled me. But they never did anything about it. They bad-mouthed it. They said how bad the Government was. They said we Democrats were nothing but Government lovers and we would defend every program."", ""Well, guess what? Now we know. Our administration reduced the size of the Federal Government by 250,000. It's the size it was now when John Kennedy was President. As a percentage of our work force it's the smallest it's been since Franklin Roosevelt first took the oath of office in 1933. That's what we did to reinvent this Government. We're still serving you, but it is smaller."", ""We have reduced the burden of Federal regulations more. We have eliminated more unnecessary programs. We've given more authority back to State and local government. We've shared more authority with the private sector than they ever did when they had the White House. The only difference is we're doing it because we think it will help to create the conditions and give you the tools to make the most of your own lives. So we still believe we ought to balance the budget, but we don't believe we ought to wreck the Medicare program or the Medicaid program or undermine education or the environment. That's the difference."", ""Folks, you know, I spent the last 12 years of my life before I moved to Washington a lot closer to Longview than to Washington. And I was in Washington at a dinner last night, and Senator Dodd, the chairman of our party, said that he sort of felt sorry for me when I showed up. I'd never been in the House. I'd never been in the Senate. I'd never served in anybody's administration. I'd just been a Governor. I didn't understand how Washington worked, and it was more about talk than action."", '[At this point, an audience member required medical attention.]', ""The President. You need some help? Where's my doctor? I've got my medical team. We've got somebody here who fainted. We're coming. We'll bring it right there. Somebody hold your hand up, and we'll find you. They'll be right there. Here they are. There's nothing else we can do. You all just—let's go on with the show here; they're going to take good care of him."", 'Now, listen, when we came there the thing that bothered me about Washington was that there was a lot of talk and very little action. Everybody spent all their time trying to get their 30 seconds on the evening news, seeing who they could blame for America\'s problems. And I said, we are going to change the way Washington works. We\'re going to stop asking, ""Who is to blame"" and start asking, ""What are we going to do to get this country moving again and help people?""', ""So I tell you today, we are better off than we were 4 years ago. But we've got a lot to do. And we're going to be better off still. And I came here to ask the people of Longview and east Texas and this great State to help and join in in building that bridge to the 21st century."", ""Now, you know this approach is right; we are better off than we were 4 years ago. We don't need a U-turn. We need to bear down and go right on into that future. And I want to ask you to help us. I want you to help me balance that Federal budget. We've already taken the deficit down 4 years in a row for the first time since before the Civil War. They talked about it; we did something about it. But we've got to balance the budget in a way that is fair to everybody. We can protect education and the environment and research and technology, we can protect Medicare and Medicaid, and we can afford a targeted tax cut tied to childrearing and education."", ""I am very proud of the fact that on October 1st 10 million Americans will get an increase in their minimum wage. You may not know there is also in that bill tax cuts to help small business if they invest more, tax cuts to help small businesses—self-employed people that have to buy their own health insurance policy. And there is also a $5,000 tax credit for any family that will adopt a child. That's pro-family, pro-work, and pro-business."", ""What I want to see us do now is to give the American people tax credits for childrearing. I want to see tax cuts for education. I want to see tax cuts for homebuying. I want to see tax cuts for medical care. And I want to explain in a minute how all that works, but the main thing I want to say to you is we can afford the right kind of tax cut. But we should not have a tax cut that is a big, across-the-board tax cut that goes to people like me who don't need it and that will increase the deficit again."", 'Now, every time I get on a plane and leave Washington, they say, ""Now, Mr. President, the economy is going well now; don\'t go down to someplace like Longview and talk about the deficit. It bores people to death. They don\'t want to hear about it, and nobody cares about it except when times are tough."" Well, let me tell you what it means. You go home tonight and you think about this. Because we cut the deficit by 60 percent, we\'re not borrowing as much money. That leaves more for you. That means interest rates are lower.', 'Now, last year our Republican friends put out a report that I agree with—I agreed with them last year, and I wish they hadn\'t changed their position—last year they said, ""If we get off of this plan to balance the budget, interest rates will go up by 2 percent."" Now, when you go home tonight, you think about what that would mean. If your car payment, your credit card payment, and your house payment went up by 2 percent, that would take your tax cut away right quick, wouldn\'t it? Think what it would mean.', ""Even worse, if all the little businesses up and down this street here and every other business in this country had to pay 2 percent more for a business loan, then small business would have a harder time expanding and growing and hiring new people. So I say, yes, cut taxes, but pay for every dime of it and still balance the budget. That's my plan. Help people educate their kids, help people build their families, but do it right."", ""The second thing I want to say is, we've got to build a bridge to the 21st century where every single person has a chance to get a worldclass education. And I could keep you here until tomorrow at this time talking about the schools and education. But let me just tell you two of the things I want to do."", ""Number one, I want to see every classroom in this country and every library and every school in America hooked up not only with computers but hooked up to the information superhighway, to the Internet, to the World Wide Web. And let me say what that means—let me tell you what that means. If you're like me and you're sort of out of the computer generation and it gives you a headache to think about all this, here's what it means in simple terms. If we can hook up every classroom in Longview to the World Wide Web, to the Internet, to all these other networks of information and we did that in New York City and we did that in the remotest place in North Dakota, for the first time in history the kids in the poorest school districts, the kids in the most remote school districts would have access to the same information at the same level of quality and the same time as the kids in the richest public and private schools in America. It has never happened before. We could revolutionize education, and we ought to do it."", ""The second thing we ought to do is to make a college education available to every single person who needs it of any age. And here's my plan to do that in three little ideas. Number one, let more families save in an IRA, an individual retirement account, for their retirement, but let them withdraw from it tax-free if they're using it pay for a college education, a health emergency, to buy a first home. Number two, make a community college education as universal in America in 4 years as a high school diploma is today. Make 2 years of education as universal by giving families a tax credit, dollar for dollar, off their tax bill for the cost of tuition at the typical community college in America today. Number three, give the families of this country a $10,000 deduction for the cost of any college tuition, any vocational tuition, up to $10,000 a year every year the kids are in college or their parents are in college. We ought to make this available to America, and we can pay for it and balance the budget. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", ""I want to build a bridge to the 21st century where the crime rate goes down for 4 more years. If we take it down 8 years in a row it might be low enough for us to stand it. And I have some specific ideas. First of all, we've got to finish the job of putting those 100,000 police on the street. For reasons that absolutely amaze me, the Congress—this Congress—is still trying to stop us from putting police on the street, even though it is lowering the crime rate and preventing crime and helping kids to stay out of trouble."", 'Number two, we ought to do more drug testing of people who are out on parole. Sixty percent of the cocaine and heroin consumed in the United States today is consumed by people who are already in the criminal justice system in some way. You should not be on parole if you go back to drugs. That will make us a safer country.', 'Number three, we ought to fully fund our safe and drug-free schools act. We ought to have a D.A.R.E. officer in every grade school classroom that needs it in America, out there helping these kids to stay off drugs and stay out of trouble. For reasons I do not understand, this Congress has tried to cut that program in half.', ""I want to do more. We have got to convince our young people not to get in trouble in the first place. We're not going to jail our way out of their problems, we've got to keep them on a good path to the future. We've got to keep them on that bridge to the 21st century. And we need to do what we can to help you folks, the parents, the religious leaders, and the people in law enforcement who are willing to go into these schools and help our kids. We need to support them in every way we can. We've got a program to do it, and I want to finish that job. And I want you to help me build that bridge to the 21st century."", 'I want to build a bridge to the 21st century where we have stronger families. And what\'s the biggest problem I hear from families all over this country? Everywhere I go they say, ""We\'re having trouble doing our job as parents and doing our jobs. We\'re working harder than ever before, but our kids need us more than ever before."" That\'s why I\'m proud that the first bill I signed was the family leave law. It\'s given 12 million families—12 million of them— the chance to take a little time off from work if they have a baby born or a sick child or a sick parent, without losing their jobs. And we\'re a better country because of that. It\'s been good for our economy. I believe we ought to expand it and say you can get a little time off from work to go to a parent-teacher conference or a regular doctor appointment with your child, too.', ""We do not weaken America's economy when we make it possible for people to do right by their children. We weaken America's economy when there are millions of workers at work all over America worried sick about their kids while they're trying to do their job. I want to create a country where everybody who wants to work can work, where everybody has to work who can work, but where every worker can be a good parent, because that's our first and most important job. That is what I'm trying to do, and I want you to help me build that bridge to the 21st century."", ""And finally, let me say that I believe almost every American now understands that we can't build a bridge to the 21st century unless we find a way to improve our environment as we grow our economy. I'm really proud of the fact that we passed a safe drinking water law; we passed a pesticide protection act supported by all the farm groups and all the consumer groups, to improve the quality of our food; that we are working hard to clean up toxic waste dumps and we cleaned up more in 3 years than our predecessors did in 12. But I am concerned about the continuing environmental challenges we have, and I want to leave you with just one."", ""As you look at all these kids in the audience today, there are still 10 million American children—10 million American children—living within 4 miles of a toxic waste site. If you will give us 4 more years, we'll clean up the 500 worst sites so we can say America's children are growing up next to parks, not poison. And that's a part of our bridge to the 21st century."", 'Now, folks, you have a clear choice in 39 days. Are we going to build a bridge to the past or a bridge to the future? Do we really think it\'s better to say ""you\'re on your own,"" or was my wonderful wife right, it does take a village like Longview to raise our kids and build our businesses and build our future? Are we going to build a bridge that\'s big enough and broad enough and strong enough for us to all walk across and that will be strong enough for our children and grandchildren to walk across?', ""You know, I want to ask every one of you to go out and talk to the people you know who aren't here today—it doesn't matter what their party is—and just ask them this, say, you know, the century only changes once every 100 years, and this country is changing dramatically, the way we work, the way we live, the way we relate to the rest of the world. It is changing. And ask people, what do you want America to look like when we go into that new century? What do you want America to look like when our children are our age? In 100 years what do you want people to say that we did at this moment in time with our responsibility?"", ""If what we do is to create opportunity for everybody who is willing to work for it, if we prove that unlike all these other countries that are torn apart by their differences, we can be a country of different races, different religions, different points of view, bound together by our fidelity to the American system and American values, that we can lead the world—that's what I want the story to be. If those are the questions people ask before the election in November, 39 days from now, I believe I know what the answers will be. You go out and reach out to other citizens so that we can go forward and build that bridge to the 21st century."", 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"
87,William J. Clinton ,"September 27, 1996","[""The President. Thank you very much. Hello, Fort Worth! Well, folks, I've got 39 more days, but the Rangers just have one more day. It is great to be here. And Mr. Mayor, thank you for welcoming me here, and thank you for your strong leadership. And I want to say on behalf of the people of our entire country, it is truly inspiring to come to Fort Worth, to stand in this gorgeous square to see the magnificent work that has been done here by your citizens—of course, the Bass brothers, but others as well— to renovate this place and make this city look beautiful and livable and attractive, a place you can be proud of. Thank you very much for what you have done."", ""Sundance Square is a place that any American would be proud to stand in and feel good in, and it shows you what we can do when we work together, when we change the way we do business from pointing fingers and trying to blame people to saying how can we roll up our sleeves and work together to make life better for everyone. That's what I am trying to do."", ""I'd like to thank Rich Connor for giving me that beautiful hat. Don't you think it looked pretty good? I thought it looked pretty good. And I'm honored to be in the long line of Presidents who have received hats from the publisher of the newspaper here. I was so impressed when I heard that President Roosevelt and President Truman and President Coolidge and Winston Churchill had gotten these hats. And then when I put mine on, I wondered, I wonder if they ever wore those cowboy hats. [Laughter] I'll wear mine, and I thank you for it."", ""I'd like to thank Art Brender and the Tarrant County Democrats who have worked so hard to help at least a fair portion of you get here today. Thank you, Speaker Jim Wright, for being here and for all your service to our country and the people of this county. Thank you, Governor Ann Richards, for all you have done for Texas and for our country."", ""I want to thank these fine young people in the Tarrant County President's Band. Aren't they fine looking? [Applause] They're going to play for us later. Thank you. Thank you, Carlton Lancaster, for the work you've done to get them together—you and Jesse and Bob Copeland. I was so impressed when I heard about this band. I couldn't wait to hear them. And they promised me now when I get off here and start shaking hands, you're going to play some more for me. You see the saxophone section raising their horns there, that's good. Thank you."", ""I want to thank Bill White, the Texas State Democratic chairman and the cochair of our campaign. He did a magnificent job for all of you when he was the Deputy Secretary of Energy in our administration. And now that he's home in Texas, he's doing a great job for all of us again. And thank you, Garry Mauro, the Texas State land commissioner and my longtime friend, for cochairing our campaign. Thank you, Senator Mike Moncrief and Representative Glenn Lewis."", ""I want to say a special word of thanks to our candidates for Congress, a man who's been a friend of mine a long time, the Fifth Congressional District candidate, John Pouland. I hope you'll help him win this election. And your former mayor, a great mayor, a man who will be a great Congressman if you will give him a chance to serve, Hugh Parmer. Thank you very much for being here today."", ""Thank you, Yolanda Cuevas-Chavera. Boy, what a wonderful representative she is of American free enterprise and the idea that if we give everybody an opportunity, all of us will be better off. We're better off that people like her can start a business and create jobs and make our communities and our country stronger."", 'I have to say that one of the things that I determined to do when I became President was to create a climate in which it would be possible for more people to start small businesses and to succeed. And in the last 4 years there are a lot more folks like Yolanda out there. And every single year we have set a record for new small-business starts. The Small Business Administration cut its budget but doubled its loan volume to provide more opportunities for small businesses to be started, including a 300 percent increase in loans to small-business women, people like Yolanda who are moving this country forward.', 'We made every small business in the country eligible for a tax cut if they invest more money in their business. We made it easier for small businesses to take out pensions for themselves and their employees and for the employees in small businesses to take those pensions with them, which is so important. And just a couple of days ago we increased the tax deductibility of the health insurance costs of people who are self-insured, which will help small-business people all across this country—more Yolandas, a stronger America.', ""Thank you, Martin Frost, for your unrelenting efforts to give the House of Representatives back to the American people and take it away from those who tried to destroy the Medicare system, take away Medicaid's guarantee of health care to families with members with disabilities, to our poorest children, to newborns, to elderly folks in nursing homes. Thank you for that. Thank you for stopping the cuts in student loans and education funding and environmental protection. And thank you, Victor Morales, for running for the Senate."", 'I want to tell you a little tale, folks, when you think about how you ought to make a decision. I had an interview with a couple of reporters today. I was in Longview before I came here. We had 13,000 folks in Longview this morning. It was a pretty good crowd.', 'I want to tell you two different stories. I had a great interview with two reporters who said, ""Why are you in Texas, and do you really think you can win here, and what\'s your message?"" And I said ""Well, you know, 4 years ago I had a pretty hard hill to climb. I had to run against two guys from Texas 4 years ago."" [Laughter] ""And Texas has been voting Republican in Presidential races on a fairly regular basis for a good while now. So I said to myself, first of all, for 12 years I was the Governor of Arkansas, your neighboring State. I spent it— I\'m sure, except for candidates for President from Texas, I spent more time in Texas in the last 4 years than anybody else that\'s running for President."" [Laughter] ""And if you look at the results of what I said we would do, what we have done, and how much better off Texas is today than it was 4 years ago, if the people are willing to give me a fair shot and look to the future, yes, I think we can carry Texas because it\'s right for the American people.""', ""I ran for President, my fellow Americans, because I thought national politics had become too much rhetoric and too little action, because I got sick and tired of people calling each other names and trying to demonize their opponents and trying to scare the living daylights out of people and convince people that their opponents were no good. And if you noticed, I gave strict instructions at our Democratic National Convention I didn't want anybody to say anything bad, personally, about Senator Dole; about Congressman Kemp, a man I like; about Mr. Perot; about even Speaker Gingrich, who says some pretty harsh things about the rest of us. What I said was, let's talk about their votes, let's talk about their positions, let's talk about where we differ, and let's look at who's right and who's wrong. That's what elections ought to be about."", ""Now, I believe that we need a common vision for our country to take us together into the next century. And here's what I want it to be like for these children in this audience: I want us to go into the next century with the American dream of opportunity alive for every single person who's willing to work for it, without regard to their race, their gender, and what they start out with in life. If you're willing to work hard, you ought to have a chance. You ought to have a chance."", ""We're living in a global economy. We're living in a global society. You can move money and information and ideas and technology around the world in no time. Our diversity, our differences, the fact that we come from so many different places is a great, great source of strength for the United States if we can learn to get along together and respect each other and be fair with one another. I want us to be one American community. And I want us to be the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity because that's an important part of our future as well. Now, how have we done creating opportunity, insisting on responsibility, and bringing us together in a community? That's the test. And what are we going to do?"", 'Now, Mr. Morales, he\'s offered himself as a candidate for the Senate. I remember in 1993 when I asked the Congress to pass our economic program, to get the deficit down, get interest rates down, get this economy moving again and keep investing in new technologies and education and the environment and protecting our obligations to our seniors, to the Medicare program, Mr. Morales\' opponent said, ""If the President\'s plan passes, the deficit will go up, unemployment will go up, the economy will be in terrible shape."" That\'s what he told you. And my opponent agreed with him.', ""Well, now we know. Now we know. You don't have to guess in Texas. And I'm glad we've got some folks in the back representing the other side. They're welcome."", 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. No, no, don't boo them. They're welcome here. This is America; everybody's welcome here. They're welcome here. I'm glad they're here. But here we are now in 1996, and here are the facts on the opportunity——"", '[At this point, the audio system failed.]', 'The President. You reckon they cut the microphone off? [Laughter] Is it on? Now? Turn this thing on. Cheer a while while we wait.', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', 'The President. Now? Now? No? Yes. Is it on?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Can you hear in the back?', 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. Well, here are the facts: We have 10 1/2 million more jobs; record exports; record numbers of new small businesses; 4 1/2 million new homeowners; a 15-year high in homeownership; a 7 1/2 -year low in unemployment—in Texas, a 15-year low in unemployment; the lowest combined rates of unemployment, inflation, and home mortgages in 27 years. We're moving in the right direction."", ""Here are the facts. Yesterday we learned in the annual report put out by our Census Bureau that median incomes in America rose about $900 last year after inflation—the biggest rise in the incomes of average Americans in a decade—and $1,600 since that plan went into effect. Listen to this: Yesterday we learned from the Census Bureau that in 1995, childhood poverty reached its lowest level, had the biggest drop in 20 years—in 20 years. We learned that the number of poor people in America went down by the largest number in 20 years. We learned that all Americans, for a change, are beginning to benefit in the economic recovery. Wages are rising for the first time in a decade, and we had the biggest decline in inequality among working people in 27 years. We're going forward together. We are going forward together."", ""And let's look at some other scorecards. In the area of health care, we made 25 million Americans eligible to keep their health insurance by passing a bill which says you can't lose your health insurance anymore just because you changed jobs or somebody in your family has been sick."", ""Yesterday I signed a bill to stop drive-through deliveries, to stop insurance companies from throwing women and their little babies out of the hospital 24 hours after the babies are born. The bill also begins to provide some protection for health care coverage for families with mental illness, a very important thing in our country. And the bill says to Vietnam veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange—many of their children have gotten spina bifida—finally, after all this long time we're going to give disability support and other help to those people who served our country. It's a good thing for America."", ""Look at the family scorecard: 12 million American families have taken advantage of the family and medical leave law that says you can take a little time off—if you've got a baby born or a sick parent you can take a little time off without losing your job. Now, our opponents didn't think much of that bill, either. They said it was bad for business. But 3 1/2 years later, we've got 12 million families that are stronger and 10 1/2 million new jobs. I think we were right and they were wrong."", ""The crime rate has come down for 4 years in a row. There were one million fewer victims of crime last year than there were when I took office. The welfare rolls have come down by nearly 2 million. Child support collections are up by nearly 50 percent, $3.8 billion a year, lifting families out of welfare. On October 1st, in just a few days, 10 million hard-working Americans will get an increase in their minimum wage. In that same bill we offer a $5,000 tax credit to families who will adopt children. There's a lot of kids out there that need homes. This is pro-family legislation at its best."", ""We have made the air cleaner, our drinking water and food safer. We've cleaned up more toxic waste dumps in 3 years than were cleaned up in the 12 years before I became President. We are moving in the right direction, building our bridge to the 21st century."", ""Our national security is stronger. There are no Russian missiles pointed at the children of America for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age. We are tackling terrorism all over the world. We are promoting peace. We have 200 separate trade agreements of all kinds, from NAFTA and the GATT world trade agreement to 21 agreements with Japan. If you doubt whether it works, in those 21 areas with Japan our American exports have increased by 85 percent. And we're number one in producing cars in the world again for the first time since the 1970's. And Fort Worth has made its contribution to our national security, for it is here that the V-22 Osprey is made, a very important part of America's defense future. And I thank you for that."", ""And our friends in the other party, they always say Government is the problem, Government is the enemy, Government is bad. But you know what? We've done more to reduce the size of Government than they ever did. It's the smallest it's been since John Kennedy was President. We got rid of more regulations, ended more unnecessary programs, gave back more authority to States and local governments to run their own affairs than our Republican predecessors did. But what we did not do is to give you a Government so weak it could not build a strong economy, invest in education, protect the environment, and take care of the people who have earned the right to a little help from the rest of us. We are going to go forward together. That is the right thing to do."", 'So I say to you, my friends, in the next 39 days, I hope those of you who are here at this rally will go visit with those who aren\'t here at this rally and say, ""You know, we might ought to vote for this President. We might ought to vote for these candidates back here, because this country is on the right track, and we don\'t want to take a U-turn. We need to go right ahead, straight into the 21st century.""', ""I want to ask you to help me to continue this work to build that bridge to tomorrow. The future of this country represents our best days if we do the right things. The kids in this audience, they'll be doing jobs that haven't been invented yet. A lot of the children in this audience will be doing jobs that have not been imagined yet if we do the right things."", ""We've got to keep this economy going. That means we have to balance the budget, but we've got to do it in the right way. We can balance the budget and still protect our investments in education, in the environment, in Medicare and Medicaid. We shouldn't let them raid workers' pension funds under the guise of balancing the budget. We can have a tax cut, but it ought to be the right kind of tax cut, targeted to families that need it for childrearing, for education, for buying that first-time home, for medical care. And when you sell your home, if you got a gain on it you shouldn't have to pay taxes on it, because it's where most people's savings are. We can afford that."", 'And that\'s what we ought to do. But we ought not to have a tax cut we can\'t afford, even though it\'s popular at election time. And here\'s why. I tell this everywhere I go. Every time I leave town in Washington, some expert says, ""Now, don\'t go down there again into the heartland and talk about the deficit. People are bored by the deficit. Nobody cares about balancing the budget when the economy is good."" Here\'s why you ought to care about it.', ""One big reason this economy has taken off in the last 4 years is that we brought the deficit down. What does that mean? We had to borrow less money. When we borrowed less, that left more for you. That meant the interest rates went down. Our friends in the Republican Party put out a study last year that I have to tell you I agree with. I wish they still agreed with it. But they agreed with it last year. What that study said was if we're not on a plan to balancing the budget, it will add 2 percent to the interest rates that American people are charged."", ""Now, you just figure it out for yourselves. What would it mean to you to have to pay 2 percent more on your credit card debt, on your college loan, on your car payment, on your home payment? What would it mean to the economy of Fort Worth and Tarrant County and Texas if every businessperson had to pay 2 percent more every time they went to the bank to borrow money? It would mean fewer jobs, a weaker economy, not as many pay raises. It's not a good deal. Let's only have the tax cut we can afford. Let's pay for it, and let's target it to education, childrearing, and build a stronger America. Let's do that."", 'I want to build a bridge to the 21st century that says to every child in this country and every adult, education is now a lifetime endeavor and we\'re going to have the best education opportunities in the entire world. Forty percent of our 8-year-olds still cannot read on their own. That is bad. They can\'t learn the rest of the things they need to learn. I want to mobilize an army of volunteers to work with parents and teachers to make sure that by the year 2000 every third grader in America can pick up a book and say, ""I can read this all by myself.""', 'I want to make sure that every—every single classroom in America and every library in every school has not only computers and educational materials and teachers trained on the computers but is hooked up to this worldwide information superhighway, to the Internet, to the World Wide Web. What does that mean? It means the kids in the poorest schools in America and the kids in the most remote rural schools for the first time in the history of this country can get the same information in the same time in the same way as the children in the wealthiest schools in America. And that will revolutionize educational opportunity. And we can do that. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', 'And most important of all, I want to open the doors of a college education to every single American who is willing to go and work for it. I want to let more families save for an IRA, for their own retirement, and then withdraw from it tax-free, if they want to, to pay for education. I want to say that we can make 2 years of college as universal in 4 years as a high school diploma is today, by giving families a tax credit, a dollar-for-dollar reduction on their tax bill for the cost of a typical community college tuition in this country. And then everybody can go. Everybody can go.', 'And I believe that we ought to give a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year to families for the cost of any college tuition, undergraduate or graduate, medical school, veterinarian school, you name it. We can lift America if we do that. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', ""I want you to help me build a bridge that keeps the crime rate coming down. The crime rate in Fort Worth has dropped 50 percent in the last 4 years, 50 percent in this community. If we lower it for 4 more years, it might be low enough for us to all feel safe again on our streets, in our homes, in our schools. That's very important. We've got to keep putting 100,000 police on the street. We've got to continue that fight."", ""And let me say one thing about that. We had a pretty rough time, our side did, in the elections of 1994, and one reason was a lot of good, God-fearing people in Texas and Arkansas and other places who loved to hunt, loved to go out in the woods and engage in sports shooting as well as hunting, were absolutely convinced when our opponents said that we were trying to take their guns away because we banned 19 kinds of assault weapons and passed the Brady bill. That's what they said, and a lot of people believed them. They were scared, and they voted against some good people in Congress."", ""Well, it's been 2 years, and it's kind of like the economic plan: Now we know. Now we know. Not a single Texas hunter has lost a rifle. Everybody is still hunting with the same weapon they had 2 years ago if they want to, every single soul in the country. But you know what? Sixty thousand fugitives, felons, and stalkers cannot get a handgun because of the Brady bill, and we're safer because of it. We are safer because of it. And I don't think they ought to be able to buy guns, people who beat up their spouses and their kids, either. I don't think they should. And I think we ought to extend it."", ""And we ought to keep going until we put 100,000 police on the street so we can prevent more crime. We ought to test people on parole for drug use, because 60 percent of the serious drugs in this country are used by people that are already in the criminal justice system. And parole is a privilege; people shouldn't be able to get out and abuse it and go back on drugs and become criminals again. Our children deserve better than that, and I hope you'll help us."", ""And one other thing, we can't entirely jail our way out of this problem. We've got to keep our kids out of trouble in the first place. We've got to do more to keep them off drugs in the first place. One of the things that I have fought hardest for is the safe and drug-free schools act, which gives schools all across our country the resources they need to make sure that they've got those D.A.R.E. officers coming into the classroom, they've got other people coming in to talk to these kids and be good role models and tell them that drugs can kill them and destroy their lives."", ""And you know, that's another thing that Mr. Morales' opponent and mine tried to cut. Now, why in the world they wanted to cut the safe and drug-free schools act and stop us from putting 100,000 police on the street is beyond me. But I think we know now we were right and they weren't. And I think we need to keep building that bridge to the 21st century. I want to ask you all to think about that."", ""There's more we need to do for families, more we need to do to clean up our environment. There's still 10 million American children living within 4 miles of toxic waste dumps. But if you'll give us 4 more years, we'll clean up the 500 worst dumps so we can say our kids are growing up next to parks and not poison. Every child in America deserves that. And I hope you'll help us build that bridge to the 21st century."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, this election is about your future and about the future of your children and your children's children. We are living in a time of phenomenal change in the way we work and live and relate to each other and the rest of the world. If we make the right decisions, if we build the right kind of bridge, if it's big and broad enough for all of us to walk across and for our children and our children's children to walk across, the best days of this country are still ahead."", 'So I ask you again in the next 39 days to help us build that bridge by going out and talking to other people and saying, ""What do you want our country to be like in 4 years? What do you want our country to be like as we start that new century? What do you want our country to be like when our children are our age?"" If we ask the right questions, we\'ll give the right answers in Texas and all across America. Help us build that bridge to the 21st century.', 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"
88,William J. Clinton ,"September 27, 1996","[""The President. Thank you. Thank you so much. Hello, Houston! I'm glad to be here. Thank you for being here. I want to thank all those who have spoken before and all those who are here with us. I thank Congressman Gene Green and Congresswoman Sheila Jackson-Lee—how well they have represented you. I am proud to work with them. I want to thank Nick Lampson, who's running for Congress in the Ninth District, and I hope you'll help him get elected."", 'Thank you, Senator Rodney Ellis, Mario Gallegos. Thank you, State Representative Al Edwards. Thank you, Texas Democratic Chairman Bill White, my longtime friend, for your service in the Energy Department in our administration and now for leading our party here. Thank you, Garry Mauro. Thank you, Victoria Baldwin. And thank you, Mayor Bob Lanier and Elyse Lanier, for your great leadership.', '[At this point, there was a disturbance in the audience.]', 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. Hey, folks, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm glad—wait a minute, wait, wait. I'm glad we've got some people from the other camp here. They need to hear this."", ""And you know, when all you do—wait a minute. And you know, it's hard to hear when all you're doing is name calling. And so, I want you to do what I said at the Democratic Convention. I want us to be respectful and polite and positive and issue-oriented, because there are some things I want everybody in Texas to hear today. And I want you to help me say it."", ""You know, I came right here to this park almost 4 years ago, right at the end of the election. And I said that I wanted to give this country back and its future back to ordinary Americans. I said that I wanted us to go into the 21st century with opportunity alive for everybody, with every citizen being responsible, and this country coming together, not being driven apart by our differences. We should respect our differences, build on them, and understand it's our meal ticket to the future. Just like the mayor said, if we can learn to live and work together, there is no stopping America and our best days are still ahead."", ""Now, 4 years ago I had a tough time in Texas. I mean the Democrats hadn't been winning the White House in a long time, and then I looked up and both my opponents were from Texas. [Laughter] It hardly seemed fair. And here you were, the biggest State in—the second biggest State in the country, representing so much of the future, and I know I'd spent more time in Texas than anybody else running over the last 40 years. And I had to run against two people from Texas. [Laughter] Well, that's not a handicap anymore, and I don't have any excuse. But neither do you."", ""So why don't we just think about where we've come from and where we're going? Four years ago this country had high unemployment, 20 years of stagnant wages, increasing inequality among working people. The crime rate was going up. The welfare rolls were going up. Public cynicism was going up because we despaired that we could make any difference, that what our leaders in Washington did would make any difference to people here at home, wherever home was in America."", ""Well, 4 years can make a lot of difference. And I appreciate what Congressman Green and Congresswoman Sheila Jackson-Lee said. I especially appreciate what the mayor said about the work we've done together. But let me tell you what happened to me when I was in Longview this morning. We had 13,000 people in Longview this morning. It was great, unbelievable. And I ran into three people, just walking down the line like I always do. After I talked, I went down the line and shook hands with people. And I ran into three people; they weren't holding my signs or the other party's signs. They weren't holding—they were just people there. But I want to tell you who they were."", 'I met a man who was a Vietnam veteran, with his wife and his child. And his child has spina bifida, has had 12 operations. That man and his child at long last, because of a bill I signed yesterday, are finally going to get the medical attention and the disability support they need.', 'And then I went down the line a little ways, and I met a lady who said, ""I\'m a 34-yearold single mother of two children, and I\'m a graduate of AmeriCorps. I worked for my community, and now I\'m paying my way through the college here to start a better life and give my kids a better life.""', 'And then I went on down a little more and I met a lady who was really crying. She was so—I didn\'t know what was the matter, she was obviously disturbed. And she said, ""I\'m sorry that I\'m emotional, but because of the family and medical leave law, I was able to take a little time off from work when my husband was so sick with cancer, and I didn\'t lose my job. And it made a big difference to our life and our family.""', ""I say this to point out that too many times over the last several years our politics in Washington have been more about hot air than concrete action to change the lives of the American people for the better. And I was determined when I went to Washington to replace the politics of finger-pointing and asking who's to blame with the politics of saying, what can we do to make this country a better place? What can we do to work together? What can we do to build a better future for our children? And I come here to tell you today we're in better shape than we were 4 years ago, and we're on the right track for the 21st century."", ""You know, I couldn't help but thinking about a lot of things that have been said over the last 4 years. I remember that Mr. Morales' opponent once said that if the President's economic plan passes in 1993, the deficit will go up and unemployment will go up and it will throw us into a recession. It's a terrible, terrible idea. And a lot of people believed him, and it took a while before we could tell, you know. But now we know. Now we know."", ""So here's the report on what they all voted against: 4 years later, 10 1/2 million new jobs, a record number of new small businesses, record exports of America's goods and services, the highest rate of homeownership in 15 years, 4 1/2 million new homeowners, every small business in the country eligible for a tax cut when they invest more in their business if they buy their own health insurance, easier for them to take our retirement plans."", ""And yesterday the census report, which comes out every year at this time, a totally nonpolitical document, tells us how we're doing. Here's what the census report of the United States said yesterday: It said that in 1995 median income— that is the families in the middle—increased on average almost $900 after inflation over '94, the biggest increase for ordinary Americans in 10 years. It said that since that economic plan passed, the increase was over $1,600 in the pockets of ordinary Americans. It said that we had the biggest decrease in child poverty in one year in 20 years in 1995. It said that we had the biggest decrease in inequality among working American families in 27 years. It said that we had the biggest reduction in the number of people living in poverty—most of them working, I might add—in 27 years. It said that we had the biggest drop recorded to the lowest levels ever—listen to this—since they have been keeping these statistics, that the poverty rate among African-Americans and American senior citizens had reached its lowest level in recorded history. We are on the right track, folks, to the 21st century. Don't let anybody kid you about that. We are moving in the right direction."", ""As Congressman Green said, on October 1st 10 million Americans will get an increase in their minimum wage. And let me tell you what else that bill does. It gives a $5,000 tax credit to anyone who will adopt a child. There's a lot of kids out there that need a good home, and this will help."", 'Thanks to the leadership of people like the mayor of Houston, the crime rate in the United States has dropped for 4 straight years in a row. And our crime bill is putting 100,000 police on the street and helping to support the decline in crime. And we ought to finish it.', 'Now, let me say one other thing. Mr. Lampson\'s opponent and a lot of other people made a lot of headway 4 years ago, going out to Texans and to people in my home State and around the country saying, ""Well, that fool President\'s trying to take your gun away. That\'s what that Brady bill\'s all about. That\'s what that assault weapons ban\'s all about. He wants to take your gun away. He\'s going to interfere with your second amendment rights."" And you know, no one knew in 1994, and it was pretty scary. But now we know. And you know something, it turned out we told the truth. That bill protected 650 different kinds of hunting and sporting weapons. Not a single hunter in Texas, not a one, lost a rifle. But 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers could not get handguns because of the Brady bill. We were right, and they were wrong. And now we know. We\'re on the right track to the 21st century.', ""The welfare rolls are down almost 2 million. Child support collections are up almost 50 percent, by $3.8 billion. That's why people can get off welfare, if their children are supported by their parents. Our environment is cleaner, our water, our air, our food. We're making progress in public health and the environment. We cleaned up more toxic waste dumps in 3 years than our opponents did in 12. We are moving in the right direction. And I came here to ask you to help me build that bridge to the 21st century. Will you do it? Will you do it?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Now, folks, I want——', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', 'The President. Thank you. Thank you.', ""Now listen, we've got just 39 days left, 39 days for every one of you to find some time to talk to your friends and neighbors and family members, other folks who work with you and live with you in Texas, people you know beyond the State borders. And I want you to talk to them about the bridge to the 21st century we have to build. There are three or four big ideas in this election. Do you think we ought to build a bridge to the future, or can we build a bridge to the past?"", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. Do you believe that you're better off on your own, or do you think the First Lady's right, it does take a village to raise our children and to build a great city, to build a great State, to build a great Nation, all of us working together? Do you believe our best days are behind us or are our best days ahead of us?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. That is what you have to decide.', 'Folks, we have to—first of all, we\'ve got to keep this economy growing. That means we have to balance the budget because that keeps interest rates down. All the experts tell me not to talk about that. They said, ""You go out to a rally, you\'ll bore people to death if you talk about balancing the budget."" But let me tell you something. Our opponents on the other side, they talk about how conservative they are.', ""We have reduced the deficit 4 years in a row. You know when the last time that happened was? You know when it happened? In the 1840's, before the Civil War. Don't tell me about conservative. Don't tell me about that. We reduced the size of the Government, the number of Government regulations and killed more ineffective and outdated programs than they ever did. Don't tell me about being conservative."", ""But I'll tell you something. I think we ought to have enough Government left to help people get an education, to protect our environment, to take care of the elderly with Medicare, and to build this country and move it forward. And I think you do too. I think you do too. So, yes, balance the budget, but do it without wrecking Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment. And do it without wrecking our commitment to the future. We have to invest in research and technology."", ""Just before I came here, I went out to welcome Shannon Lucid back to Houston from space. And I was given a note before I welcomed her that said when she was a little girl, she told someone that she wanted to be a rocket scientist, and an adult said to her, there's no such thing, and if there were, it wouldn't be a woman."", 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. Well, let me tell you something. My little girl and little girls all over America and not so little girls, they think Shannon Lucid's pretty great. And they think—and a lot of little boys do too. And the point is that she is doing something that we could not have imagined just a few years ago. And these kids in this audience today—and all of you who brought your children, I want to thank you and all of you young people that came on your own, I want to thank you. But our commitment to the space program is one example of the fact that we are going to solve problems, climb mountains, and push back boundaries in ways that we cannot even imagine. You young people will be doing work that hasn't been invented yet, often that hasn't been imagined yet."", ""Let me just give you just a couple of examples. Number one, we have more than doubled the life expectancy of people with the HIV infection in only 4 years with medical research. Number two—I'll give you another example. A lot of you were very moved by what Christopher Reeve said at our Democratic Convention about the importance of medical research. He's so brave, so powerful. Just a few days before he made that speech, it was revealed that for the first time ever in laboratory animals with severed spines had movement in their lower limbs because of nerve transplants to those spines. Who knows what we can do to give people their mobility back, to give people their future back? Who knows? We have to keep fighting for that. We have to keep fighting for that. Third example: The United States just issued into a joint venture with IBM to build a supercomputer that will do more calculations in one second then you can do on your hand-held calculator at home in 30,000 years. That is the future, and I'm determined to see that we keep investing in that future so every one of these kids will have a place in it."", ""And let me say this: We can have a tax cut. But it ought to be a tax cut that is targeted to folks who need it and targeted to the purposes that will help our country most, to raising children, to getting people a college education, to paying for health care and the first home, and to making sure people don't have to pay a tax on their home when they sell it, because often that's the only savings they've got in life. That's the kind of tax cut we can afford and we ought to have the one we can afford, but we shouldn't have one we can't afford. You don't want to go back and run up this deficit again."", ""One thing our friends in the other party said last year that I agree with—they were absolutely right, and I hate to see them change their position—last year they said if we're not on a plan to a balanced budget, it will add 2 percent to our interest rates. Now, I want you to go home and think about this tonight. What would it mean to you if you had 2 percent on your car payment, 2 percent on your credit card payment, 2 percent on your home mortgage, 2 percent on your student loan? What would it mean to the economy of Houston and Texas if every business person had to pay 2 percent more to borrow money? It would mean fewer jobs, slower growth, fewer pay raises. It would take us right back where we were. We do not want to go back; we want to go forward, build a bridge to the 21st century."", 'And I want to ask you to help me build a bridge to the 21st century that will give worldclass education to all of our children. And I hope you will do that. First thing I want to say is, we\'ve got a lot of great educational opportunities in this country, but 40 percent of the 8-year-olds in America can\'t even read a book by themselves yet. And I want to mobilize an army of volunteers, through AmeriCorps, through senior citizens, through reading specialists, to go out and work with parents and teachers so that by the year 2000 every 8-year-old in America can pick up a book and say, ""I can read this all by myself."" And I want you to help me do that.', ""I want us to connect every classroom and library and every school in America to the information superhighway. You know why? A lot of you are older like me and aren't great with computers. Let me tell you in plain language what that means. If we put the computers, the software, the teachers out there who understand it, and then we hook it up to all these information networks, what that means is, for the first time in the history of America the kids in the poorest, inner-city schools, the kids in the remotest rural schools in west Texas and North Dakota and you name it will have access to the same information at the same level of quality in the same time as the children in the richest schools, public or private, in the United States do. It will revolutionize education. We can do that if you'll help. We can do that. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", ""Let me say this: Most of us are going to have to face the fact that education is a lifetime endeavor. More and more the average age of people going to college is higher and higher. More and more when people lose a job, they've got to go back to school and get training if they want to get a better job instead of a worse one. We have got to make the doors of college open to every single American who is willing to work hard to be a good student. That ought to be the only criterion."", ""And I want to do three things. Number one, I want more families to be able to save in an IRA, an individual retirement account, save for their retirement account, but take it out without any taxes if they're using the money to pay for education."", ""Number two, in 4 years I want at least 2 years of education after high school, a community college degree, to be as universal in America as a high school diploma is today. And it will be easy to do. This is not complicated. Nearly every American lives within driving distance of a good community college. And they work or they'd go out of business. They're great institutions. What we propose to do is to let you take off your tax bill, dollar for dollar, the tuition cost at the typical community college for 2 years, so that every American of any age can go. And we can pay for it in the balanced budget."", 'And finally, in this great city with great higher education facilities and great medical facilities, I believe we ought to give the American taxpayers a deduction of up to $10,000 a year for the tuition cost of any education after high school at any age. And I want you to help me deliver that.', ""There's a lot more we have to do, folks. We need to keep supporting people like your mayor here and finish the job of putting 100,000 police on the streets. We need to keep supporting community antidrug activities and antigang activities like the safe and drug-free schools programs that I fought so hard for and that we stopped this Congress from gutting when they tried to do it. We need to keep doing that."", 'We\'ve got to keep working, and I have a plan to help the cities and the private sector create a million jobs to help the new welfare reform law succeed. Let me say this: That new law says something simple and straightforward and it\'s controversial, but I want you to know why I believe it\'s the right thing to do. It says the Federal Government will continue to guarantee to poor families medical care and nutrition, and if the person takes a job, more money on child care than ever before. But we\'re going to give what used to be in that check to the States, and eventually to the local community workers, and they have to figure out how to turn that welfare check into a paycheck for every able-bodied person within 2 years. That means that everybody in Houston, Texas, that ever cussed the welfare system has now got an obligation to say, ""What can I do to help these people go to work?"" Because we want people to succeed at home and at work. That\'s what we want for poor families, what we want for working families. And I intend to help, and I want you to help. I want you to help.', ""We've got to keep working to help our families succeed at home and at work. Anywhere I go in America, the number one thing I hear from families is that every working family, whether they're modest income, middle income, even upper income working families, nearly every family I talk to with children can cite one or two traumatic examples in their lives when they've had a real conflict between their jobs and their job at home of raising their children. I say we want to build a bridge to the 21st century where Americans can succeed with their children—their most important work—and at their jobs. And that's what this whole policy is all about."", 'That\'s why, with all respect to the folks who are here, I think we were right and they were wrong when I signed the family and medical leave law. Now, what they said was, ""If you pass this family and medical leave law, it will be terrible for business."" All the law said is, if your business has 50 or more employees, an employee can have a little time off when there\'s a baby born or a sick parent or a sick child, without being fired. That\'s all it said.', ""Now, 3 years later, now we know. Twelve million families have taken some time off, and during that time we've got 10 1/2 million more jobs and a record number of new small businesses every year. We can protect work and family in America and build this country together."", ""I believe we can improve our environment, not just protect it, and grow the economy. And I want to tell you that in spite of what I said before about toxic waste sites, there are still 10 million American children living within 4 miles of a toxic waste dump—10 million of them. But if you'll give us 4 more years, we'll clean up the 500 worst dumps, and our kids will be growing up next to parks, not poison. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause] Will you do that? [Applause]"", ""Let me make one last comment. A big part of building our bridge is how we relate to the rest of the world and how we relate to each other. I'm proud of the fact that this country is a safer country than it was. The nuclear threat has been diminished. We have been a force for peace. We have strengthened our efforts against terrorism. We have dramatically expanded trade. But we have to face the fact that we are going to live in a global society where no matter where you live, we can transfer ideas, information, money, technology, across the borders of nations in a split second."", ""Now, if you think about that kind of world, there is no nation as well-positioned as the United States to do well. Why? Well, look around this crowd today—because we all come from somewhere else. Everybody but the Native Americans all come from somewhere else—everybody. When I welcomed the Olympic teams to Atlanta, there were teams from 197 different national groups. The largest county in America, Los Angeles County, has people from 150 of those places in one of our counties. When I looked at the American Olympic team it occurred to me that if they took their uniforms off we wouldn't know where they're from. [Laughter] They could be from China; they could be from Japan; they could be from India; they could be from Pakistan; they could be from the Middle East; they could be from the Nordic countries; they could be from Europe; they could be from Latin America; they could be from anywhere. That's America."", ""This is not a country based on race, ethnicity, or specific religious convictions. This is a country which has said for over 200 years, if you believe in the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and the Constitution of this country, you're our kind of person. All you've got to do is show up tomorrow and behave, and we'll build a bridge you can walk across into the 21st century. Now, you have to ask yourself, do you believe that?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Will you help us build that kind of bridge?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Do you believe our best days are still ahead?', 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. Then for 39 days go out and tell it to other people, and we'll have a great victory in Texas and in America."", 'Thank you, and God bless you. Thank you.']"

And finally, Senator, after so many years in which our national politics have become too mean, too personal, too divisive, and too full of hot air, it was a real honor for me to stand up here and watch you once again in positive, graceful, constructive tones set out what is best about our country, best about our Constitution, and best about public service. We wish you well, we love you, and we thank you.', ""And thank you, Jack Reed, also for a lifetime of service, beginning with your career at West Point, culminating now in your soon-to-be ascendance to the United States Senate, for representing the American dream.

Thank you."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, I am especially glad to be here in Rhode Island today and with Senator Pell to bring you some exciting news that occurred late last night. Last night we reached a broad bipartisan agreement on the budget for the Government next year. It is good for America because it continues to move us toward a balanced budget while protecting, not violating, our values. It is especially exciting for me because the budget adopts my program to continue our advances in education. And it is a fitting tribute to Senator Claiborne Pell's last session of Congress because—and I don't think he knows this yet—the budget we agreed to last night contains the biggest increase in Pell grant scholarships in 20 years."", 'The budget will put 40,000 more young children in Head Start. The budget fully funds our commitment to the technological literacy initiative which will connect every classroom in every school in America to the information superhighway by the year 2000. It protects our environment by funding clean air, clean water, and safe food. It recognizes that we are both a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws. It builds on our approach to combat illegal immigration at the borders, in the workplace, and in the criminal justice system, but it does so without hurting innocent children or punishing legal immigrants. Thank goodness we have turned that around.', ""It restores the antidrug funding I asked Congress to pass, including full funding of the safe and drug-free schools program, to give our children something to say yes to early in life so they don't get in trouble in the first place.

And I'm proud that the Congress agreed last night."", ""It enacts the terrorism proposal I made last month—antiterrorism proposal—and puts into effect Vice President Gore's commission's recommendation on increased airport security measures, making air travel safer for all Americans and those who come here.

It continues the program until we finish the job of putting those 100,000 police out and making all of the streets of America safer for our children and their families to walk."", ""And in a marked departure from the congressional efforts of just several months ago, it not only reflects an abandonment of their attempts to repeal the ban on assault weapons, but it accepted my recommendation that we expand the Brady bill to say that now that we've taken guns away or prevented guns from going to 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers because of the Brady bill, it's time to extend that and say you shouldn't get a handgun if you beat up your spouse or your child either.

After the rally I did as I customarily do, I walked down along the line there and shook hands with people. And within the course of 5 minutes I met the following people.

And in that bill which ended drive-by pregnancies, we also said at long last and too late, we're finally going to give some help to those people. They're qualifying for disability. They're qualifying for medical support. Their sacrifice should not be visited on their children, and if it is, we'll do our best to make it right. That's what this country is all about.

I said I wanted to take this country into the next century with the American dream alive for every person who was responsible enough to work for it. I said I wanted our country to be the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity.

Last year after inflation the typical family's income went up by $900, the biggest increase in a decade. Last year we had the biggest drop in child poverty in 20 years. Last year we had the biggest drop in the number of poor people in 27 years. And we had the biggest decrease—decrease—in the inequality of incomes of working families in 27 years. We are on the right track to the 21st century."", ""As the previous speakers have said, we have expanded educational opportunities. As the mayor noted, we have done what we could to work with local communities to bring the crime rate down. And the crime rate in America has gone down for 4 years in a row. There are almost 2 million fewer people on welfare. Child support collections have gone up almost 50 percent, by $3.8 billion. And that's one of the reasons people are moving off welfare, because parents are being required to assume responsibility for their children again."", ""The Family and Medical Leave Act not only helped that lady in Longview, Texas, who talked to me yesterday; 12 million times American families have been able to take a little time off from work when a baby was born or a child or a parent was sick without losing their jobs. And it's been good for our economy. I'd like to see it expanded so that families can take some time off to go to regular parent-teacher conferences and regular doctor's appointments with their children or their parents."", ""I want to see a country where people can succeed at home and at work. One of the biggest challenges facing us today is that the American people are working harder than ever before and almost every parent of any income group can cite a few examples in life when they were afraid that the demands of their work took away from the responsibilities of their parenthood. There is no more important job than raising our children. We have to keep a strong economy. That's what things like the Family and Medical Leave Act are for. We have a more productive economy when people are not worried sick about their children while they're at work. That is the kind of America I am trying to build."", 'Now, I think we also have to face the fact that we\'ve got to build on—we have to build on the pioneering work of Claiborne Pell to keep America\'s educational opportunities and standards and performance up to the finest in the world. And there are two things I\'d like to emphasize in particular. Forty percent of the children in this country who are in the third grade still can\'t read a book on their own. It\'s going to be very hard for them to master the demands of the information age if that\'s so. I want to mobilize an army of AmeriCorps volunteers, reading specialists, senior citizens to go in and work with parents and work with schools to make sure that by the year 2000 every 8year-old in this country can pick up a book and say, ""I can read this all by myself.""', ""When we finish the work of hooking up all of our classrooms to the information superhighway—for those of you who aren't computer geniuses like our children are, but I'm not, let me explain in plain language what that means. It means not only computers and educational materials and the computers and teachers trained to work so that they're not letting the kids get ahead of them on the computers, it means something else. When you hook all these computers into the Internet, into the World Wide Web, into these other information networks, what that means is that for the first time in the entire history of the United States the children in the poorest inner-city schools, the children in the most remote rural schools will have access to the same information at the same level of quality in the same time as the children in the wealthiest and best public and private schools in the United States. It has never happened before. We can do it now, and we must do it now."", ""And I want, finally, to make sure that we have literally opened the doors of college education to every person in this America who is willing to work for that, without regard to their income. And I have three specific proposals to add to what we're doing."", ""Number one, I think more Americans should be able to save in an IRA, but withdraw from that retirement account without tax consequences if they're going to pay for a college education, a health care emergency, buying a home."", 'Number two, I believe that we should give people like Dawn literally the cost of at least a community college education so that we can say by the year 2000, we have made 2 years of education after high school just as universal as a high school diploma is today. And it will be easy to do. It would be easy to do. I propose a tax credit which would let people take from their income taxes, dollar for dollar, the cost of the typical community college tuition in America. It will be a wonderful thing. We can overnight say the community college system is accessible to all of you. And it will pay us back, and we can pay for it.', 'And finally, I think we ought to make up to $10,000 a year of college tuition deductible for any kind of higher education, 4-year colleges, medical school, veterinary school, you name it. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', ""We need to build a bridge to the 21st century that continues our work to prove that we can clean up our environment and grow our economy. There are still some people who don't believe that. But let me tell you, there are still 10 million children growing up within 4 miles of toxic waste dumps. If you'll give us 4 more years, we'll clean up the 500 worst dumps so that we can say our children, they're growing up next to parks, not poison. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", ""Finally, let me say we've got to keep this economy going, growing, and strong. That means we do need to balance the budget, because that keeps interest rates down, that keeps your home mortgage, your car payments, your student loan payments, your credit card payments down. It keeps the interest rates on business loans down so more people can borrow money to grow new businesses and hire new people."", ""But we cannot do it in a way that violates our values and tears us apart as a country. We do not need to destroy the Medicare program in order to save it and balance the budget, and I don't intend to let it happen. We do not need to revoke our historic guarantee of health care coverage to poor mothers and their little children, to the elderly who are in nursing homes, whose children are often middle class workers who would be poor if it weren't for Medicare helping their parents. And we must not do it to families who have family members who have disabilities. That keeps them in the middle class and gives their family members the dignity of decent health care without driving the families into poverty."", ""We cannot do it by cutting back on education or the environment or on research. Here we are celebrating the space program. You clapped for that. There's more on the way. We have doubled the life expectancy of people with HIV in just 4 years because of medical research and the rapid movement of drugs into the marketplace."", ""Many of you were very moved by Christopher Reeve's speech at the Democratic Convention calling for more research dealing with spinal cord injuries and other medical problems. Let me tell you, just a few days before he gave that speech, for the first time ever, a laboratory animal with a completely severed spine showed movement in its lower limbs because of nerve transplants into that spine. No telling what we can do if we keep pushing back the frontiers of knowledge. We cannot walk away from the future."", ""So there it is. You have the evidence. You have 4 years of proof that we're on the right track; that saying we're building a bridge to the future, saying it takes a village, saying that community and opportunity and responsibility are the right way to go. You have a world of evidence around the world, where countries are being torn apart when they don't get along with each other, when they discriminate against people based on their race or their gender or their ethnicity or their tribal group or their religious convictions. This country is in the best shape of any nation in the world to go into that next century, and our best days are still ahead if we vote on November 5th to build a bridge to the 21st century."", 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"
90,William J. Clinton ,"September 28, 1996","['The President. Thank you.', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. Thank you. Thank you. Hello, Fall River! Mr. Mayor, thank you for making me feel so welcome. Senator Kennedy pointed out I have been all over the world. This is my first trip here. If I had know what I was missing, I'd have been here sooner, I can tell you that. Thank you very much. Thank you."", ""Are there any Portuguese-Americans here? [Applause] Obrigado [Thank you], Fall River. I'm glad to be here. I'm delighted to be here with all of you. I thank Joan Menard for starting us off and for the good work she has done. I want to thank Jim McGovern for presenting himself as a candidate for Congress, and I hope you'll make him a Congressman. He'd be a good one. I want to thank my good friend Congressman Barney Frank who's here, who used to represent you in the legislature. Thank you, Barney. And I want to thank his sister, Ann Lewis, who is the spokesperson for my Presidential campaign. You may have seen her on television taking up for me. She's going to wind up getting her name recognition up as high as her brother's, and that's a pretty good thing. And I want to thank their proud mother, Elsie Frank, who is here somewhere today. I saw her. Thank you, dear."", 'I am delighted to be here with all of you. But I want to say a special word of thanks, as an old musician, to Our Lady of Light Band and the Mike Moran Band. Thank you both for providing the music for us.', 'Thank you, Senator Ted Kennedy. And Vicki, thank you for being here. You know, I wish I had as much energy as Ted Kennedy does. I just left Providence, where I was with Congressman Patrick Kennedy, and he was the bounciest person on that stage. Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot imagine the phenomenal impact that Ted Kennedy had on this Congress. After they passed their radical budget and I vetoed it and you made clear—you and people like you all across America, in all 50 States, Democrats, Republicans, and independents, too—that you basically agreed with me and us and not them, it was just amazing what Ted Kennedy was able to do in this Congress.', ""The Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform bill will make 25 million Americans eligible to keep their health insurance when they change jobs and say they can't lose it if somebody in their family gets sick—25 million. And this Congress, which just a year ago was out there trying to raise income taxes on the lowest income working American families, trying to lower the income of the working people with the lowest incomes in the country—thanks to the leadership of Ted Kennedy, on October 1st, which I think is Tuesday, 10 million Americans will get a pay raise when their minimum wage goes up. Thank you, Senator, thank you."", ""And I might add that bill will also make it easier for people in small businesses to take out retirement plans and for employees in small businesses to keep those retirement plans when they move from business to business. So it's good for workers and good for business. It also has a $5,000 tax credit for families who adopt children who need a home, and I hope more of them will get a home now. Thank you for that bill. It's a good bill for America."", ""I'm delighted to be here with my friend Senator John Kerry and with Teresa. And I want to tell you, folks, I know that John Kerry has a vigorous and spirited race. But every one of you here in Fall River knows what's really at stake. We're going through a period of great change in this country in how we work, how we live, how we relate to the rest of the world, what it will take for us to see that every American lives up to the fullest of his or her Godgiven potential."", ""When I put forward my economic plan in 1993, the other side said it would cause a recession and increase unemployment and increase the deficit. Well, now we know. We've got 10 1/2 million jobs, and the deficit has gone down 4 years in a row for the first time since before the Civil War. John Kerry was right. He's on the right side of history."", 'When we tried to get past 6 years of talking tough on crime but nothing happening—rhetoric and rhetoric and rhetoric and no action—to put 100,000 police on the street, to ban deadly assault weapons, to pass the Brady bill, the other side, they led the fight against it. But John Kerry helped us pass the toughest, smartest, best crime bill this country has seen in many a day, and the crime rate has gone down for 4 years in a row. John Kerry was on the right side of history, and Massachusetts should stay with him.', ""And when we were expanding Head Start and passing that school-to-work program Senator Kennedy talked about to help young people who don't go to 4-year colleges get good training and good jobs, when we improved the college loan program by cutting the cost and improving the repayment terms, when we did these things, the other guys, they tried to stop us. But John Kerry helped us pass it. He's on the right side of history. And he's on the right side of history in making college available to all Americans. We'll do it if you give us 4 more years and if you give us John Kerry back to the United States Senate."", 'And finally, let me thank Sheila Levesque. Could every one of you get up here and do what she did?', 'Audience members. No-o-o!', 'The President. A single mom, a nurse, worked all night long on her shift, hadn\'t had any sleep—I said, ""Sheila, did you get any sleep last night?"" She said maybe an hour or two since she got off work—stood up here in front of this vast crowd and told you the story of her life. The reason we wanted her to do that is that this election is not about the politicians on this stage. This election is about whether the decisions we make connect and improve and advance the lives and the values of people like Sheila Levesque all over this country. That\'s what this election is about. That\'s what it\'s about.', ""When I was in Providence, I was introduced by a woman who got a Pell grant to go back to the community college to try to do right by her family. And there was another young woman there in Providence that I featured in my book and that spoke at the Democratic Convention, a Puerto Rican immigrant girl, a high school dropout, worked several jobs, joined AmeriCorps, our national service program, and then got herself—after dropping out of high school and becoming a leader in AmeriCorps— got herself into Brown University, where she just started her second year. That's what this is all about, helping people to make the most of their own lives."", 'Yesterday I was in the great State of Texas. And people tell me, ""Well, that\'s a Republican State; what did you go down there for?"" I\'ll tell you why I went. There were 13,000 people in the small town of Longview, Texas, at about 8:30 yesterday morning. And after I spoke, as is my custom, I went out into the crowd and I started shaking hands. I met the following three people in 5 minutes. I met a 34-yearold single mother with two kids who joined AmeriCorps and had gotten herself some money helping the local community and was going back to the junior college there.', 'Then I met a woman who said, ""Mr. President, if it hadn\'t been for the Family and Medical Leave Act, I don\'t know what I would have done. My husband had cancer, but I got to take some time off and be with him when he was so desperately ill without losing my job and wrecking our family."" You know, the other side, their leaders fought against the family and medical leave law. But John Kerry and Barney Frank and Ted Kennedy, they were on the right side of history, helping people succeed at home and at work. It was the right thing to do.', ""And then I met a man who had a camouflage jacket on, obviously a veteran. He was a Vietnam veteran standing there with his wife. His little daughter was in a wheelchair. She'd had 12 operations because her father served our country in Vietnam, was exposed to Agent Orange, and like far too many children of veterans, his child got spina bifida. But finally last week in a bill that I signed, we finally at long last gave help in the form of disability payments and extra medical support to the children of Vietnam veterans born with spina bifida—who were exposed—and it's high time. That's what this election is all about. That's what this is all about."", ""My fellow Americans, you were very good to me in 1992, but you took me on faith and the word of others. When I said to you that we could create an America in the 21st century with opportunity for everyone responsible enough to work for it, where we were coming together and respecting our diversity instead of being torn apart by it, where we were still leading the world toward peace and freedom and prosperity, you took me on faith. But after 4 years of working for opportunity, responsibility, and a stronger community, you don't have to do that anymore. The evidence is in, and now we know. Now we know."", 'With 10 1/2 million more jobs, a record number of new small businesses, and the census report last week telling us—I almost wept when I read it. Who ever heard of crying over a dry Government report? But every year they tell us how we did the year before. So the census report for 1995 said, compared to the year before, that typical American families had $900 more after inflation; that we had the biggest drop in childhood poverty in 20 years; the biggest drop in poverty in female households in 30 years, female-headed households; the biggest drop in the number of people living in poverty in 27 years; and the biggest drop in the inequality of working families in 27 years. We are on the right track to the 21st century, and we need to keep going. We need to keep going.', ""We have more to do. We have more to do to build that bridge to the 21st century. Yes, we made a lot of progress these last 3 months because you made your voices heard. But you have to say again on election day, what is the direction of this country? And in all candor, friends, I'm tired of the meanness and the personal attacks that have dominated our politics for too long. There are honest differences between us. We can share them with respect."", ""And the ideas here at issue that will determine whether we're on the right side of the future are the following: Do you believe that we have to build a bridge to the 21st century big enough for all of us to go across, or can we try to reach back and build a bridge to the past? You know we have to build a bridge to the future."", 'Do you believe, as my opponent said in all honesty in his speech to the Republican Convention—he was being absolutely honest and candid, and he said, frankly, he did not agree with the First Lady that it took a village; he thought families and individuals would be better off being left alone, that they could do better on their own. You know something? I think Hillary was right. I think it does take a village to raise our children and build our communities and build our future. But you have to decide. You have to decide.', ""I'm glad that a little of my—a precious little of my income as a tax-paying citizen went to help to give Sheila Levesque a chance to be a better mother, a more productive citizen, and build a better future. And you know what? I think I'm better off because of that, and I think you are, too."", ""For every young person in this audience, I believe it is a good thing for us to enact the educational program for the 21st century that Senator Kerry outlined. Why shouldn't we say we're going to make 2 years of community college education as universal as a high school diploma is in the next 4 years? We need to do it. Why shouldn't we do it? Let people take the money off their taxes for the cost of a typical tuition. Why shouldn't we give people a $10,000 tax deduction for the cost of tuition after high school, any kind of college tuition, people of any age? Why shouldn't we do it? We can pay for it. I'm for that."", ""And I'm for balancing the budget, too, because that will lower your interest rates on your student loans, your car payments, your house payments, on your credit card payments. It will lower your interest rates. It will keep interest rates down for business loans so that we can keep creating new jobs and build on the economic record of the last 4 years. But I am not for doing it and using that as an excuse to wreck Medicaid, which has given our commitment, our solemn commitment of health care to poor children, to the elderly in nursing homes, most of them themselves the parents of middle class families. I don't want to see us walk away from middle class working families who because of Medicaid have had family members with disabilities who could live in dignity without driving their families into poverty. We don't have to do that to balance the budget, and I won't do it."", ""We don't have to cut back on education or environmental protection. And we have to continue investing in research and technology. Yesterday, folks, I was in Houston, and I welcomed home that magnificent astronaut Shannon Lucid when she came home after 6 months. A lot of you saw her come home. When she was a little girl, she told an adult she wanted to be a rocket scientist when she grew up. And she was told, there is no such thing, and if there were it wouldn't be a girl. [Laughter] Well, guess what? There are a lot of them now, and a lot of them are women. And the young girls of America and the young women liked seeing Shannon Lucid up there."", ""What is the point of that? President Kennedy believed we could go into space and make a success of the space program, and he fought for it. I'm glad he did. I'm glad he supported it. I'm glad I have supported it. And I'm glad we've still got it. And I think those who thought it shouldn't be done were wrong. We have to continue to invest in research to build a better future. I want the young people here to be able to do those jobs of the future. We are today building a supercomputer with IBM that will do more calculations in one second than you can do on a hand-held calculator in 30,000 years. And we have to do that."", ""We are today seeing experiments with laboratory animals whose spines have been severed, who have movement in their lower limbs again because of nerve transplants. We have doubled the life expectancy of people with HIV and AIDS in only 4 years. We have to keep going and investing, and we're better off when we do that, building a better future, being on the right side of history, building that bridge."", ""So here's what I want to know from you. For 38 days, for 38 days, will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause] Will you talk to your friends and your neighbors, your coworkers, people in Massachusetts and your friends beyond in other States and say, we have got to keep building that bridge to the 21st century, and we've got to go across it together? We cannot be divided by race, by gender, by religion, by ethnic group. We are a great, great country, and our best days are still ahead if we are committed to going across that bridge together. Will you do it?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. Then we'll prevail. Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you.""]"
91,William J. Clinton ,"October 03, 1996","['The President. Thank you. Wow! Thank you. Thank you. Hello, Buffalo! Hello, Erie County! You know, Congressman LaFalce, I am on my way to Chautauqua to prepare for the debate. And I was listening to you go through these steps, and it occurred to me that I ought to take you with me. I need to remember—I hope I can remember all those things you just said Sunday night in the debate.', ""I am glad to be back here in Buffalo. I thank you all for being here. I want to say thank you, Mayor Masiello. Thank you, Erie County Executive Dennis Gorski. I want to thank the leaders of the State Democratic Party, the Deputy Speaker, Arthur Eve, and Mrs. Eve. Now they have two sons working for me. Thank you very much. We have Mayor Galie from Niagara Falls here. And we have two other candidates for Congress here. I'd like to ask them to come forward and wave: Tom Fricano, the congressional candidate from the 2d District, and Fran Pordum from the 30th District. There you are. Thank you, gentlemen."", ""And I want to thank the high school band for playing for us. Let's give them a big hand. [Applause] The colder it gets the harder it is to play one of those instruments, I know. But in Buffalo, this is a heat wave, right? [Laughter]"", ""Let me tell you, I am delighted to be back here in your county, in your city. I'm glad to be back in western New York. You know, 4 years ago when I came here and asked you to help me rebuild the American dream, our country was drifting toward the 21st century. We had high unemployment, stagnant wages, the slowest job growth since the Great Depression, rising crime, increasing inequality among working families, and increasing tensions in our society. We were drifting toward the 21st century. And 4 years later, we're on the right track, roaring toward the 21st century. And I thank you for your support of our efforts."", ""We have worked hard to create a country in which the American dream is alive and well for all of our people, a country that is coming together instead of being driven apart by our diversity, a country that is leading the world to peace and freedom and prosperity. And compared to 4 years ago, there's a lot of good news: 10 1/2 million more jobs; average family income is up $1,600 after inflation since we passed the economic plan that our opponents said would drive the country into the ditch. They were wrong, and we were right."", 'We have record numbers of new businesses. Ten million people got an increase in their minimum wage the day before yesterday, on October 1st, when the minimum wage increase went into effect. And we learned last week that economic benefits are finally going to all of our working people. We had the biggest decline in inequality among wage earners in growing incomes in 27 years; the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years; the lowest poverty rate among senior citizens ever recorded; the biggest drop in childhood poverty in 20 years. This country is on the right track for the 21st century.', ""When I became President our deficit was $290 billion and headed higher. We'd quadrupled the debt in 4 years. It is now going down 4 years in a row, the first time that's happened in any Presidential administration since the 1840's, before the Civil War. We are moving in the right direction."", ""Our deficit would not exist today, we would have a surplus today—a surplus today—we would have even lower interest rates, we could cut taxes more, we could grow the economy faster if we had a surplus today, which we would have if it weren't for the debt run up in the 12 years before I became President with the same economic program that our opponents are advocating today: Never mind, just cut taxes across the board; blow it off; who cares about the deficit. You should care. Why? Because if the Government has to borrow money, we're competing with you for borrowing money. That means your interest rates go up."", ""And that's one thing I want to say: When you think about the 21st century, you have to decide. We need a targeted tax cut that is targeted to education, to childrearing, to buying that first home, to medical emergencies. And it needs to be paid for, dollar for dollar, dime for dime. We do not need a huge, explosive, across-the-board tax break that goes to people that don't need it, like me, and increases your deficit, your interest rates, which means higher car payments, higher college loan payments, higher home loan payments, higher credit card payments, and higher interest rates for the businesses in Erie County who are trying to borrow money to grow their businesses and hire people and get this country moving even stronger. I say let's have the right kind of tax cut, but let's do it in a way that grows the economy and builds all American families and makes us a stronger country. I hope you will support that approach."", ""Let me say there are also 12 million families that have been able to take a little time off from work without losing their jobs when a baby's born, when a parent's sick, when a child's sick because of the Family and Medical Leave Act. And I want to see it expanded to let families go to those parent-teacher conferences and take their children and their parents to the doctor without losing their job. It's the right thing to do."", ""We have made every small business in America eligible for a tax cut if they invest more in their own businesses to grow the economy and make their businesses and our country stronger. We've made it easier for small businesses to take out pensions and for their employees to take those pensions from job to job. And that's very important. Only about half the American people now have a retirement plan at work. More and more of our businesses are smaller business. More and more of our people are working there. This is a very important thing, making it easier for small-business people to have retirement plans for themselves and their employees."", 'And we have made it easier for people who are self-employed to take out health insurance because they can now deduct more of that health insurance premium from their tax bill. We are moving in the right direction.', ""We have made 25 million Americans more eligible for health care by passing the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill because it says you can't lose your health insurance anymore just because you change jobs or someone in your family has been sick. We are moving in the right direction to the 21st century."", ""And in the closing days of this session of Congress, as the American people—I don't want to take credit for this; I want to give you credit for this—in the closing days of this session of Congress—what a difference a year makes. As you heard John LaFalce say, a year ago they shut the Government down. But in the closing days of this session, they passed legislation that I asked for ending drive-by deliveries, saying you couldn't kick mothers and newborn babies out of the hospital within 24 hours anymore. The doctors and the mothers should make that decision based on what's best for the health of the mother and the baby."", 'They gave some coverage in the health insurance policies for mental health, which is a very important thing to families all across America. They covered for the first time—and thank goodness we have finally done it—with extra health and disability benefits, children of Vietnam era veterans who have spina bifida because their parents were exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam. This is a better country now. We are moving forward. We are doing things that are consistent with our values.', ""And I'll tell you something else. The crime rate has gone down for 4 years in a row; there are one million fewer crime victims now than there were. The crime rate's not low enough, but you think about it: If we could bring the crime down 8 years in a row with a strategy that's working, this country may have safe streets, safe schools, safe neighborhoods, and the American people may feel genuinely secure again in their homes and at work and when their children go off in the daytime. That is the America that I'm working for in the 21st century."", ""Here in this county, you have benefited from our commitment to put 100,000 more police officers on our streets. In 1994, Congress passed that commitment. And in only 2 years, we have already funded 44,000 of those police officers. Now in this budget we're going to keep going until we finish the job, more police working to prevent crime as well as catch criminals, working with neighbors, working with children, working with school groups, working with church groups. This will work. This will work."", ""Just before I came here today I met with the police officers who have been named the Top Cops of the year by the National Association of Police Officers, and we celebrated the work done just in the closing days of Congress for safer streets. The Brady bill—not very long ago this Congress, the majority, was telling people that the Brady bill was going to take guns away from folks. Well, it didn't take any guns away from hunters, but 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers did not get handguns because of the Brady bill. And the Congress in this budget actually answered my call to expand the Brady bill in a very limited way to say if you've got a felony record, you shouldn't get a handgun. That's what the bill says now. Now it says if you have beaten up your spouse or your child, you shouldn't be eligible to get a gun either. And that is the law of the land, and that's a good thing for America. That's a good thing for America."", ""And finally, the Congress did something that I really strongly agree with and have asked for. They said that if States want to get money from the Federal Government to build penal facilities, they have to drug test people in prison and on parole. Sixty percent of the heroin and cocaine bought in this country is purchased by people who are involved in the criminal justice system: they're on bail; they're on probation; they're on parole. We ought to test those people. They ought to be treated. And we ought to say, look, parole is a privilege, not a right. And if you do drugs, you're going back to jail.

But you can see what happens when we all work together. And that is my commitment to you, to do that for 4 more years, to try to build that bridge to the 21st century.', ""I had a simple strategy. Bill said he liked it when someone has a simple strategy and goals and all that. I believe that a country, just like a company, big, small, or medium-sized, has got to have an animating vision and a strategy for carrying out that vision and some way of having benchmarks along the way to see if you're doing what you ought to be doing, and not just on economic issues but also on social issues."", ""One of the things that struck me when I traveled the country in 1991 and 1992 was how many people had just sort of given up on dealing with our social problems. They just sort of thought: Well, that's just sort of the transaction cost of being in America in the 1990's: high crime, intractable welfare problems, exploding out-of-wedlock birth rates. This is part of being American, part of being in this world; it's not just our country, it's every place else, nothing to be done about this."", ""And I basically don't believe that. I think all— just as I know the Bible tells us we'll have problems until the end of time because of flaws in human nature, I believe that. But I also believe we at least ought to be given new problems. [Laughter] I want my successors to have a new set of challenges to deal with."", ""And so we had an economic strategy to keep the American dream alive for everybody who was responsible, to keep our country the strongest force in the world, to bring our people together, and a stronger sense of community so that we'll be strengthened by our diversity, when every day all you have to do is pick up the paper or watch the evening news to see that differences among people, racial, ethnic, religious, and other differences, are tearing the heart out of societies and regions all around the world."", ""In America we're turning all those differences to our advantage. And I think more and more we're getting comfortable with the fact that we are more than ever still a nation of immigrants and that there are more immigrants from more different places and that we have these differences. And it's a great asset in a global economy that we're all so different. As long as we share a common set of values and we show up every day and do the right thing, it's in a way our meal ticket to the future. And the strategy we have pursued to try to expand opportunity, to try to tackle our social problems and generate more responsibility, and to keep building that American community, and then reaching out to the rest of the world, has worked."", ""My economic benchmarks were cut the deficit in half, see if we can't have 8 million jobs. We wound up with a 60 percent cut in the deficit and 10 1/2 million jobs, thanks to you and people like you all across the country. And I thank you for that."", ""And I'd like to point out that we have—of these new jobs, the largest percentage of these jobs are private sector jobs—93 percent—than any recovery since the end of World War II— fewer Government jobs, more private jobs, any recovery since World War II. The Federal Government is about 250,000 smaller, just under 250,000. State and local governments have grown, but overall, the net contribution to those 10 1/2 million jobs from the Government sector is 7 percent. Your contribution is 93 percent. And that's because, in no small measure, we are now adopting a lot of the techniques, improved productivity that many of you have incorporated over time. So we're moving in the right direction."", 'We have expanded exports to historic levels with 200 trade agreements, 21 with Japan alone. And they make a difference.', ""We have worked to try to help create more success stories like Carolyn. When I became President the expensing provisions for small businesses were $10,000 a year. They're $25,000 now. If you're just starting, that's a whole lot of money. It makes a big difference if you have to invest more when you're just starting out."", ""We've reformed the pension laws as the White House Conference on Small Business asked us to do to make it easier for people to take out 401(k) plans and then for the employees of small businesses to carry it around job to job with them in a way that doesn't discriminate against employers if they let them bring those plans with them, a very important issue. We made the health insurance premiums more deductible for self-employed people. And we're moving to do some other things that I believe will make health insurance more affordable. So these things are important."", ""The Small Business Administration cut its budget and doubled the loan volume. And I'm proud of that. And I might add—we had a huge increase—we have increased loans to people in all categories. We had big increases in loans to women and minority business owners, and we didn't change the standards a bit. We just went out and looked for people who were good people who had good ideas and tried to make sure they had a good chance to compete."", 'So we have more to do. We were visiting before I came out here. One of the people up here on the stage, John Correnti from Nucor, said, ""Remember, the only thing I ever asked of you was low interest rates. I\'ll do the rest."" [Laughter] He\'s laughing back there, but it\'s true. In order to do that we\'ve got to continue this work on balancing the budget. We have to do it in the right way.', ""There are others here who need in that balanced budget a strong American research budget. We've got another billion dollars in research in our balanced budget over 7 years. That's an important part of our future."", ""Even IBM—we're doing a joint project with IBM. Some of you have heard me say this before: We're going to build a supercomputer that will do more calculations in a second than you can do with a hand-held calculator in 30,000 years. This dilemma about do you trust the Government or the people, that's not it. The Government is just the people, acting together— just the people acting together."", ""There are some things that we can do better together than we can do alone. We can't expect a lot of these initial investments to be made without Government research. The Internet is the product of a publicly funded research effort now being turned over to the private sector, as it should be. We don't know how to run things like that, but the initial research, the ideas, the development should be done with a contribution from the public sector where it's appropriate. The same thing is true in medical research, a lot of other areas. So we've got to keep doing that, and I feel very strongly that we can."", ""Let me just say a word about the whole litany of other issues I've told you about—the social problems—to get to the welfare issue that I wanted to talk about today. I went around the country and discovered that there were lots of places where the crime rate was going down, not going up. But it was going down for some very simple and straightforward reasons. The police were going back to the streets again and not staying in their cars. They were working with neighborhoods. They knew kids on the street. They were preventing crime. They were being deployed in ways that prevented crime more and caught criminals quicker. And they wanted some help."", ""And the crime bill of '94 was designed to put another 100,000 police on the streets because in the previous 30 years, violent crime had tripled as our population had gone up and got more violent. But we'd only increased our police forces by 10 percent, and we hadn't redeployed them. And because there were not enough of them, they were increasingly driving around in cars, isolated from the action."", ""So that's what the crime bill was all about, to increase the police forces by 20 percent, to put the police out there to prevent crime, and the assault weapons ban, the Brady bill, and all the rest. And it's working and that's—so we're contributing to a nationwide determination to get the crime rate down."", ""We're now trying to get a million more volunteers, citizens to work in citizen patrols. And a lot of the people in the telecommunications business had offered us phones for citizens patrols to go out there and work with the police."", ""San Diego, California, where our next debate is, you'd think they would have terrible problems with crime. It's right there on the border, and we do a lot of work to stem illegal immigration—the fifth lowest crime rate of any major city in America, partly because they have huge numbers of retirees in citizens patrols, working those neighborhoods in partnership with the police, protecting the kids, going forward. So we can do something about that."", 'The teen pregnancy rate has gone down for 4 years in a row and out-of-wedlock pregnancies as a whole dropped in 1995 for the first time in 20 years because of local grassroots community efforts that are working.', ""So these things can be done. One good evidence that the private sector, too, is contributing to this, I might add, was the census report on the economy that comes out every year. And last week we learned that in 1995, for the first time in a long while, all classes of working people, without regard to their incomes, had an increase in their income. And that represented the biggest decline in income inequality among working people in the United States in 27 years. That's a tribute to the business sector working to let people share in the growth of the economy."", ""So I say this to set this welfare issue up. It is not true that you can't do anything about social problems. That is not true. And we have to, first of all, say to everyone in America, get that out of your mind. Now, it is also not true that you can ask people in business to make their primary mission solving a social problem if it is inconsistent with the mission of business."", ""Here is the welfare dilemma; I worked on welfare reform for 16 years. I've been in welfare offices. I've talked to lots of folks on welfare. I've talked to people who work with people on welfare. They all pretty much say what Carolyn said. Nearly everybody who is on it wants to be off. Nearly everybody who is not working is willing to work. But what's happened is that the fundamental nature of the population on welfare is very different from what it was 60 years ago when that program started. And now we live in a society where most people work and most parents work even when their children are young. And most people on welfare have become increasingly unemployable and isolated from the rest of us. At least that's true for about half of them."", ""Now, in the last 4 years, the welfare rolls have gone down by almost 2 million, because we've worked with people like Governor Dean, who is here, with the Governors. We've had— 43 States have established new partnerships with the Federal Government, to get out from under outdated rules, to change the welfare system to meet the needs of the new population, to move people from welfare to work. That, plus a growing economy, helped us to reduce the welfare rolls by 2 million."", ""Now we're left with people like the folks that Carolyn works with in Georgia. And we have to make greater efforts. I signed the welfare reform bill amidst great controversy. You all know it was very controversial. I vetoed the first two bills because they took the—one of them took the guarantee of Medicaid coverage, the health care coverage, away from families on welfare, which I thought was a mistake, and messed with the school lunch program. They both did that, and I thought it was wrong."", 'The third bill did not do that. Here\'s what it does. Here\'s what the bill that I signed does. It says, in this new system the National Government will continue to guarantee health care for poor families and nutrition and, if the welfare recipient goes to work, more money for child care than ever before. You heard her say that\'s a big problem. But what used to be the welfare check—the welfare check now goes to people once a month; it\'s part Federal money, part State money. What used to be the welfare check, we\'re going to send the Federal portion of that to the States and say, ""You can decide how to spend this. You have 2 years for all the able-bodied people on welfare to turn that welfare check into a paycheck."" That\'s what it says.', ""Now, the people who criticized me for signing it say that it will never happen and we can't do anything about it, and you're consigning these poor people to more poverty, and you're going to hurt the kids. I just honestly disagree with that. But I will tell you this: If we all lay down on the job, the new system will be worse for some poor people and their children than the old system. The problem is that the old system had limits on it. There are always going to be a certain core of people who are able-bodied who were never brought into the mainstream of society and who were left in what is an increasingly physical isolation from the rest of mainstream society. And it's wrong. And their kids were never going to get the chance they deserved. They were never going to have the future they deserved. And we were going to see a lot of people who never became part of the American mainstream."", 'And this new system, if we do it right, gives us the chance to do what we should have done all along, which is to take poverty out of politics and turn welfare into not just a State-based but a community-based program where people are dealt with as people.', 'All these folks are different. They have different abilities. They have different problems.', ""They have different hurdles to overcome. And we should have—in Stamford, Connecticut, or Hot Springs, Arkansas, where I graduated from high school, or any other place in the country— a community-based welfare program where the employers of the community, the churches, all the people who are interested in this are all working together. And everybody who gets a check knows that if they're able-bodied they've got to go to work if there's a job there. That's what we ought to have as a community-based program."", ""So here's the trick. How do you do that when you know that the Government still has a deficit, and we can't create enough public service jobs to hire these folks? So they have to be hired in the private sector. And I can ask you to help, but I can't ask you to do anything that undermines your own fundamental mission, which is to make your business a success."", ""That is what I want to talk about just a moment today because the welfare reform bill was just the first step. We now have to figure out how to reform welfare. That's very different than passing a bill. We actually have to go out and do it. And while the States and the communities will be able to do a lot of this, we still have certain responsibilities, one I am attempting to meet by giving special tax credits to people who hire people off welfare and keep them hired for a year. And we think that will help to move people, a million people, from welfare to work."", ""But let me also say that I'm particularly glad that Bill Esrey is here today, and one person who wanted to be here and couldn't is Bob Shapiro from Monsanto, because they have worked in Missouri with a program in Kansas City that I believe is what we ought to do everywhere. And that's why I've been going around challenging every business person who ever cussed out the welfare system to go see the Governor, go see the mayor, work out a system where business can participate in putting people back to work in ways that don't hurt the business."", 'How can we do it? My answer is, look at Kansas City. What they did was—and we gave them permission to do this; they had to change a lot of Federal rules. In Kansas City, they have a full employment council. They have one building where they do adult education, process people on welfare, deal with social problems, the whole nine yards. Business people, church people, welfare people—everybody in the community is represented on this council.', ""Here's what we did to change the rules. They will give any employer who will hire someone new the welfare check for 4 years. If you hire somebody off welfare, you've got to pay them a minimum income that's over the minimum wage—I don't know exactly what it is now; it started out at $6 an hour—but we'll give you the welfare check. So let's assume the welfare check is worth $2.50 an hour; that's your premium for training people, for finding out what their problems are, for helping make sure their kids are going to be all right, for dealing with all of those things, and maybe dealing with somebody who has never been in the work force before and literally doesn't even know such elemental things as how to show up on time and do basic things. But this is it; you get it."", ""We're not asking you to do this totally out of the goodness of your heart. You take the welfare check, and you become the trainer. Now, consider what this will do. This means there won't be any big programs where you're gathering huge numbers of people; instead, you will be integrating people into the mainstream of American life. And if every business in the country, every church of any size in the country, every nonprofit in the country, everybody just hired one person, this problem would go away."", ""And then in future times, when the economy goes down and we have recessions, everybody would be treated the same. Unemployed people would just be unemployed people. They'd be in a tough time. We'd take care of them until the economy got going again. But there wouldn't be this separate class of people isolated as people on welfare unless they had some disability that prevented them from being in the mainstream. We wouldn't be isolating them anymore. This is important."", 'There are other things that can be done. There are some people who are represented here who have made investments in areas specifically so they could hire a disproportionate number of poor people. I know Eric Sklar of Burrito Brothers is doing that in the Washington area. Sandy Weill has a great program at Travelers, called the academy of finance, which is designed in part to train people who might become welfare recipients to stay off of it in the first place.', ""But I'm telling you, this is a problem we can solve. This is not rocket science. There is X number of people on welfare who never seem to get off but who are physically and mentally able to work. Maybe they need substance abuse treatment. Maybe they need job training. Maybe they need something else. But now they're not categories anymore, they're people living in certain communities. And no one has an excuse anymore."", ""And all you need, if you want to participate in this, is to make sure that your Governors and your community leaders and your legislators make it possible for you to do what the business community can now do in a place like Kansas City. That's all you need to do."", ""I met—Bill and I were in Kansas City the other day with a guy that had 25 employees. It's a great small business story. He stored data for the Federal Government. And he won all these competitive bid contracts—25 employees. Five of them were former welfare recipients he had hired. And the way the Missouri program works is you have to promise to keep one person for a year unless they're really bad—they have to do something terrible—and then you don't have to keep somebody if they're just unemployable. But you can keep one person in a job slot for up to 4 years and get the welfare check."", ""However, you can keep the slot for 10 years. So if you can promote them up or they can go on to other jobs or whatever, you might do 10 people in one job slot. But it's a manageable thing, don't you see, in a big country like ours, with all of these different employment units and all of these different sizes; this is a manageable thing. We can do this."", ""And think how we'll feel if there's no politics in poverty. Think how we'll feel if we know that we treat everybody the same. And sure, at any given time in our country's life, there will always be some people out of work. But there won't be this separate class of people who literally we have isolated and hurt terribly by not imposing more responsibility and giving more opportunity to, and their kids."", ""This is a huge deal. But let me say—I will say again, only the private sector in America can prove that I was right to sign that bill and those who thought I was wrong were wrong. The Government cannot hire all of these people. We still have a deficit. We're going to give the communities some funds if my next budget prevails—some funds so that communities can help. There are all kinds of things that need to be done in communities that can help in the short run as we go through a transition. But this has basically got to be a private sector show."", ""So that's the last point I want to make today. I am very gratified that every person here, every one of these executives has promised to do what they can to help us meet this national challenge. I thank you for that. And I want you to help me get more executives, more businesses in every community in the country to do it."", 'Thank you. Thank you, and God bless you all.']"
95,William J. Clinton ,"October 07, 1996","[""Thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, 5 years ago today, on October 7th, 1991, I came to New Hampshire. I am told that I am the only sitting President since your own Franklin Pierce to actually come to New Hampshire every single year of my Presidency. I can tell you that on this gorgeous fall day, looking out at all of you and seeing so many of you who have been my friends now through good times and bad, there may be someone in America right now who's happier than I am, but I have no idea who it would be. I am glad to be here. Thank you, and God bless you all."", ""It's great to be back in Manchester. I want to thank the mayor and all those who came out to the airport to greet me. I want to thank the two football teams who changed their schedule so we could all be here, the Central High JV and the Concord High JV. Let's give them a hand. [Applause] Where are they? There they are back here and back there. Thanks. I want to thank the bands, the Central High School and the Spalding High School Marching Bands over here. Give them a hand; they did a great job. [Applause]"", 'I want to tell you how very proud I am to be up here with these fine candidates. I was listening to Arnie Arnesen speak, and I thought, she could double the energy in the House of Representatives all by herself. We need that kind of vigor in this country.', 'And I heard Joe Keefe and I remembered how I employed him in the dark days to stay on as the chairman of the Democratic Party in New Hampshire, and he said he would, and what a difference a year and a half makes. Thank you, Joe Keefe, for fighting for New Hampshire, for America, and for the future of this country.', ""I looked at Dick Swett and I thought of the times when we talked in quiet places without big crowds about this country and its future. I remembered when he was for a law to require Congress to live under the same laws it imposes on the rest of us before it was popular, before anybody knew anything about it. And it's the law of the land today. And I campaigned on it in 1992 in the State of New Hampshire because of the work that Dick Swett did. And he can do better work if you'll send him to the United States Senate where we can move forward and stop the negative forces and build the positive forces of America."", 'And I was thinking of the first time I ever met Jeanne Shaheen and what a terrific Governor she would be for any State and especially for New Hampshire. Jeanne, I thank you.', ""And I thank you, Dick, for what you said about the debate last night. I enjoyed that debate, and I thank Senator Dole for joining me, and I believe that the American people got a pretty good feel for the differences between us, the differences in our views. And we just proved you can still do it and be civilized and decent and humane. And that's the way we ought to conduct our public affairs in this country."", 'Four years ago when I came here, the issue was how we could get our economy going again, how we could pierce the rising tide of cynicism in our electorate, how we could pull this country back together again. Today, the issue is what path will we take to the 21st century? Are we on the right path or should we turn back to another path?', 'If you look at where we are now compared to where we were 4 years ago, just think back to then and what it was like in New Hampshire, a time of high unemployment, bankruptcies, rising frustration and anger. I said then and I repeat to you today: I want this country to go into the 21st century with the American dream alive for every single child in America, with our American community coming together instead of coming apart.', 'Think how many places in the world today are crippled and face destruction because people who come from different religions or races or ethnic groups simply cannot get along. In America, we can all get along if we share the same values and we honor our system and we show up for work.', ""And I was determined to see this country continue to lead the world for peace and freedom. But 4 years ago you took me on faith. You don't have to do that anymore. Now there's a record: 10 1/2 million jobs, record numbers of new businesses, record exports of American products, 4 1/2 million new homeowners, 10 million homeowners who refinanced their homes at lower interest rates, 4 years of declining crime rates, child support up 50 percent, welfare rolls down 2 million, out-of-wedlock births dropping for the first time in 20 years. This country is on the right track to the 21st century."", ""Four years ago we doubted whether ordinary Americans would ever benefit even from an improving economy. But now we know we can turn that around. Since the passage of our economic plan, the average income for families, the typical family in America, has gone up more than $1,600 after inflation. Last year we had the biggest drop in poverty in 27 years, the lowest poverty rate among senior citizens ever recorded. And all people, all working people, were finally beginning to benefit from our endeavors. We had the biggest drop in inequality of working people's incomes in 27 years. We are on the right track to the 21st century."", 'And so I say to you, I hope that you in one month and one day, and all the American people like you all over this country, will make a decision to stay on that track, to plow new ground, to think new thoughts, to come up with new ideas, to leave behind the old debates, the old policies, and the things that got us in so much trouble because they were long out of date.', ""Just think how far we have come and where we can go. We have cut the deficit by 60 percent. It's gone down in all 4 years for the first time since the Second World War. Truth is, it's gone down in 4 years for the first time since before the Civil War. But we had a surplus in some of those other years."", 'But now we have to finish the job. People tell me—people tell me in Washington, ""Now, don\'t go anywhere and talk about balancing the budget because it bores people now, and it requires tough decisions."" But it\'s important. Why? Because these declining deficits have meant as the Government borrows less money, it\'s easier for you to borrow money. That\'s why interest rates are lower for home mortgages, credit card rates, car payments, student loan payments, and business loans. That\'s why they\'re lower, because we\'re bringing the deficit down. So I say to you, now we have to finish the job of balancing the budget in a way that enables us to continue to invest in education and research and protect the environment and the health care of our seniors and our families in need. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', 'We cut taxes for 15 million working families and made every small business in America eligible for a substantial tax cut when they invest more in their business. Now we have to cut taxes to help families raise their children and educate them, to pay for buying a home, not to pay taxes when you sell a home, to deal with a medical emergency. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', ""We passed the Family and Medical Leave Act. We just passed a bill to stop what I call drive-by deliveries, requiring—letting insurance companies force mothers and their newborn babies out of the hospital within a day. That's over now. We ended that. We finally gave some recognition to the needs of mental health in health insurance policies. And finally, after a long, long time, we made the children of Vietnam veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange, who contracted spina bifida as a result, finally we made those families eligible for health care and disability payments that we should have done long ago. We're moving in the right direction."", ""Now we ought to expand family leave to say you can take a little time off from work without losing your job to take your parents or your children to regular doctor's appointments or to go to that conference with a teacher at your child's school. We ought to give our families the opportunity if they earn overtime at work to decide whether to spend that overtime—to get that overtime in more money or more time if their children or their sick parents need it. We ought to do that as well."", ""We made 25 million Americans more likely to keep their health insurance with the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill by saying no one can take your insurance away from you now just because you change jobs or because someone in your family has been sick. Now we need to finish the job and cover people when they're between jobs. That is also in my balanced budget plan. Will you help me build that bridge for families to the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'We passed the toughest crime bill in history and are bringing the crime rate down 4 years in a row. We need now to take on the tough problem of juvenile gangs, and we need to finish the job until we get all those 100,000 police out there like the ones I saw here in Manchester helping you to recover your neighborhoods. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', 'We worked with States all over this country to move nearly 2 million people from welfare to work. And then I signed a historic welfare reform bill that says we will continue to provide to poor families health care and nutrition, and when the parent goes to work there will be more for child care than ever before. But now every State and community in the country has to take what used to be the welfare check, and if the adult, the parent, is able-bodied, that welfare check has to become a paycheck within 2 years. Will you help me create the jobs to put people to work and end the cycle of dependency in America and build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', ""We've worked hard to improve our environment, to take chemicals out of the air, to make our drinking water safe, to improve the standards of health for our food. We've cleaned up more toxic waste dumps in 3 years than the previous administrations did in 12. We fought their attempts and we beat back their attempts to cut environmental protection, toxic waste cleanups by a third, to take over some of the national parks and let them be privatized. We've protected our national parks, but we have to continue to enhance America's environment and to clean up the worst toxic waste dumps in this country so our children are growing up next to parks, not poison. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'And above all, will you help me make education our number one priority so that all of our people can create, compete, and win? [Applause]', ""My fellow Americans, the young people in this audience, within just a few years—let's hear it for them—[applause]—the young people in this audience, many of you will be doing jobs that have not even been created yet. Many of you, in fact, will be doing work that has not been imagined yet."", 'We are pushing back the frontiers of knowledge, creating new activities, and coming together across national boundaries all across the world as never before. In just 4 years, medical research has more than doubled the life expectancy of people with HIV infections—in just 4 years.', ""We are—within a few years, every time a young mother comes home from the hospital, the mother and father will be able to get a genetic map which tells you what your child's health care profile will be like for a lifetime. People will know how to raise their children, what kind of exercise they most need, what kind of diet they most need, what kind of medical care they most need. We will extend life and make it more abundant because of what we are doing in research. But we have to have people educated to do it."", 'We are doing a joint project now—research with IBM to build in a matter of a couple of years a supercomputer that will do more calculations in one second than you can do on your hand-held calculator in 30,000 years.', 'We have got to invest in education and make America the education capital of the entire world. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', 'Will you help me mobilize an army of volunteer literacy tutors, AmeriCorps volunteers, and others so that we can make sure that by the year 2000 every single 8-year-old in America can read independently? [Applause]', ""Will you help me prove that we were right and those who opposed us were wrong, that the Goals 2000 program allows local schools to set their own grassroots reforms to achieve excellence? It's not a national standard of uniformity on the schools of New Hampshire; it's an empowerment tool to challenge every State to set national standards and international standards of excellence and cut the schools loose to achieve them. Will you help me do that? [Applause]"", 'Will you help us hook up every classroom in America to the information superhighway so that all of our students, no matter whether they are poor, rich, or middle class, can have access to the same learning at the same level of quality in the same time for the very first time in the entire history of the United States of America? Will you help me do that? [Applause]', 'And finally, will you help me open the doors of college education to every single person in America of any age who needs to go? [Applause] Will you help me pass a tax credit so that people can deduct dollar for dollar the cost of tuition at the typical community college or vocational training school so that everybody can get 2 years of education after high school? [Applause] Will you help me pass that deduction of up to $10,000 a year for the cost of any college tuition so that every family can afford to go? [Applause]', ""My fellow Americans, it feels a lot different in New Hampshire than it did 4 years ago. But the faces are the same; the spirit is the same. You embody the character and hope and promise of America. I can never thank you all for what you have done for me and for Hillary, for our family, our campaign, and our administration. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be here tonight, and you know it."", 'New Hampshire, you gave me the chance to serve you for 4 years. You know now that what you took on faith has been justified by the record. The American people saw last night the stark choices before us. Our best days are still ahead.

96,William J. Clinton ,"October 07, 1996","[""The President. Thank you. Hello, Maine! Hello, Portland! Thank you. I have had a wonderful day today. I started off, as you know, in Hartford where we had the debate last night. I hope you got a chance to watch it. And then I went to Stamford, Connecticut, where 2,500 business executives, some of whom had never supported a Democrat before, announced their support for the Clinton/Gore ticket and the direction we're going."", 'And then I went to Manchester, New Hampshire, where 5 years ago to the day—to this day 5 years ago—I came to New England and began my campaign for President. And now here I am with you in a State which can claim a lot of responsibility, if you think I did all right last night, because George Mitchell played Senator Dole in all my practice sessions and beat my brains in. And I thank him for that. [Applause] Thank you.', ""I'm glad to be back; I'm glad to be back in Maine. I thank Mayor McDonough for coming out to meet me, and thank you, my longtime friend Libby Mitchell, for your exuberant beginning of this rally tonight. Thank you, Victoria Murphy, for your work for the Democratic Party. And I'd like to thank the other elected and some former elected officials who are here, including former Governor Ken Curtis, a longtime friend; your State treasurer, Sam Shapiro— thank you, Sam; Andrew Ketterer, the State attorney general; Bill Diamond, the secretary of state; Dan Gwadosky, the speaker of the house; and Mark Lawrence, the Democratic senate leader. Thank you all for coming."", ""I'd like to thank the Windham Chamber Singers for singing tonight, the Westbrook High School Marching Band, the South Portland High School Marching Band. I'd like to thank Mark Persky for being the emcee before we started. And I'd like to say a special word of thanks in a serious way to Commander Burton Russell and to everyone who has been involved in the cleanup of the spill. Thank you all for your hard work. We're going to get beyond this. We're going to do fine."", ""I'd also like to thank Governor Brennan for giving me some good Maine lobsters. They'll be on Air Force One going back to Washington tonight when I leave."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, this is a good week for my family. Hillary was here about a week ago. And she told me she had such a good time I thought I'd come back and see for myself. And I must say I never dreamed that this whole place would be full. I'm gratified by your presence. And I know you're here because you care about your country and you want to help us build that bridge to the 21st century."", ""I hope you will remember, those of you who live in John Baldacci's district, that when the chips were down and when our friends in the other party passed that budget which—here we are on the eve of the 21st century—cut education by $30 billion, cut the student loan program, cut Head Start——"", 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. ——cut environmental protection by one-third, cut funds for cleaning up toxic dumps by a third, ended the guarantee of Medicaid for medical care for seniors in nursing homes and poor children and families with disabilities, and of course, in spite of what they say, did cut Medicare $270 billion, and then they shut the Government down to try to make me sign the bill—I vetoed it, but John Baldacci upheld the veto. He made it possible for this country to start going in the right direction.', 'I have known Joe Brennan a long time. We served as Governors together. We have been friends for many years. He has always believed that education was the key to our future. He has always believed we could grow the economy and preserve our environment. He has the values, the vision, and the direction that will serve Maine well in the United States Senate, and I hope you will send him to the Senate on November 5th.', ""And finally, let me say on a purely personal note, I first met Tom Allen in 1968. We were much younger then. [Laughter] He doesn't have any gray hair, and I'm fairly bitter about that. But if you send him to Congress, it will take care of it and equalize things."", ""From the first day I met Tom Allen, he talked about Maine. He had Maine in his bones, Maine in his blood, Maine in his dreams. He spent his life here serving you. I hope you'll let him serve you in Washington, because he will represent your interests and never forget his roots and advance your cause."", ""I want to say one other word about Senator Mitchell. In addition to doing a masterful job of playing Senator Dole in our debate preparations, I'm sure all of you know that I've asked George Mitchell to make himself available and the parties in the Northern Ireland peace process have asked him to try to broker a peace there. It is a difficult situation. The conflict goes back hundreds of years. We had another painful setback today, but if anybody can bring people together and get them to reason and listen to their hearts and think with their minds and go forward and let go of the past, it is George Mitchell. And I thank him for that."", ""I'd also like to say I'm grateful for all the people in Maine who are doing better and who have new jobs. But I want to thank all the folks here on the platform and George Mitchell for talking to me about the interests and the welfare and the future of the workers at the Hathaway Shirt Company. I thank him for doing that, and I'm for you, fellows. We'll do what we can to help. Thank you for being here."", 'Ladies and gentlemen, last night we heard two very different visions of our future. I thank Senator Dole for being a part of this debate, and I felt after it was over that both of us were able to demonstrate that we can disagree strongly and firmly without letting our political dialog disintegrate into a rude shouting match. We can be civil and decent to one another and build this country together, and that is a good thing. That is a good thing.', ""Four years ago, I ran for President at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration. I was determined to change this country, to turn our country around to make sure that when we enter the 21st century, we would be driven by a vision of the American dream alive and well for everybody willing to work for it; of an American community that is coming together instead of being torn apart as so many people in the world are today by their racial, their religious, their tribal differences. In this country, it doesn't matter; if you believe in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and you're willing to show up tomorrow and be a good citizen, everybody can have a place in America. And that's the way I want it to stay."", 'And I wanted to keep our country the strongest force for peace and freedom in the world. So I came to Maine, and I said, ""Vote for me, and we\'ll change the way politics works. We\'ll have a simple strategy: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community in which everybody has a role to play."" I promised you that we would have a Government that was smaller and less bureaucratic, that responded to the needs of people and gave people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives.', ""Well, 4 years ago you took me on faith. But now there's a record. You heard a little about it already tonight. No matter what others may say in the debate, there is a record: 10 1/2 million more jobs, record numbers of new businesses and exports of American products, 4 1/2 million new homeowners, incomes on the rise for the first time in a decade, the typical American family with an increased income of $1,600 after inflation since our economic plan passed 3 years ago. Last week we learned that in 1995 we had the biggest drop in poverty and the biggest drop in income inequality among working people in 27 years, the biggest drop in childhood poverty in 20 years, and the lowest rate of poverty among American seniors since we began to keep statistics. We are on the right track to the 21st century."", 'And here at home we are beginning to come together around our basic values. For 4 years in a row, the crime rate has dropped; the welfare rolls are down by almost 2 million; child support collections are up by almost 50 percent; and for the first time in 20 years—in 20 long years—the rate of the number of out-of-wedlock births is going down. This country is on the right track. We are moving back to our roots and forward into our future in the best way: together.', ""The question before the American people now is, what path will we take to the 21st century? Will we stay on the path we're on, or will we take a U-turn to the policies of a failed past? Do we believe we have to build a bridge to the past, or are we going to build a bridge to the future? Do we believe that we're better off when we just give each other a good lettingalone, or do we believe, as I do, that the First Lady is right: It does take a village to raise our children and build our country and move us forward."", ""My fellow Americans, we are better off than we were 4 years ago. But the real question is, what are we going to do for the next 4 years to build that bridge to the 21st century. We have to keep going. We cut the deficit by 60 percent. It's the first time the deficit's gone down in each of the 4 years of a President's term since before World War II; in fact, before the Civil War. But we have to finish the job. We ought to balance the budget and do it in a way that protects education, the environment, Medicare, Medicaid, and research. We can do that. And we can give targeted tax cuts to families for education and childrearing and buying that first home, and still balance the budget. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", ""To help our families succeed at home and at work, we passed the family and medical leave law, which 12 million people have already taken advantage of. We raised the minimum wage for 10 million hard-working workers. We passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy health reform bill, which says to 25 million Americans you can't lose your health insurance anymore just because you changed jobs or because someone in your family has been sick."", ""Just recently, I signed a bill I was particularly proud of, which says that mothers and their newborn babies can no longer be forced by insurance companies out of the hospital after a day. It says that health insurance policies have to bear fair consideration for people in families that have mental health challenges. And it says, finally, something that's very important to me, and I know very important to my fellow Arkansan, Libby's husband, Jim Mitchell; it says, finally, after all these years, to the Vietnam veterans whose children were born with spina bifida because they were fighting for our country and were exposed to Agent Orange, finally we're going to give you the medical help with the disability support your children deserve. It is high time. We are moving in the right direction."", ""So we've made a good beginning, but we have to do more. We ought to expand the family and medical leave law to say you don't lose your job if you take a little time off from work to take your children or your parents to regular doctor's appointments and to go to the school to meet with your child's teacher. It will make America a stronger place."", 'We ought to amend the law for people who have to work overtime to give them, not the employers but the people, the chance to decide whether to take their overtime pay in money or in extra time with their children, their parents, their spouses, if there is an illness at the home and they need it.', ""We ought to take the next step in health care reform and recognize that people should not lose their health insurance when they're between jobs. My balanced budget plan contains the funds to help people between jobs keep health insurance for their families up to 6 more months. It could help 5 million people a year, and we ought to do it."", ""We've got the crime bill coming down for 4 years in a row. If we can do it for 4 more years, the American people might actually feel safe again on their streets, in their schools, in their homes, in their neighborhoods. We can turn the crime problem around in every place in the country. The next big step is to keep on until we put all 100,000 police on the street so we can get that crime rate down, tackle the problem of gangs, and make America as safe as it ought to be again."", ""We have reduced the welfare rolls by nearly 2 million. I signed an historic welfare reform bill. And I want to tell you just a minute about that. It was a little controversial, I know. But I want to tell you why I signed it and why I think it's the right thing to do."", 'The bill says the National Government will continue to guarantee to poor families medical care and nutrition and if the parent goes to work will provide more money for child care than ever before. But it says the portion of the monthly welfare check itself that used to come from the Federal Government will now be sent to the States, and States and local communities like Portland will have 2 years to figure out how to turn that welfare check into a paycheck to liberate people and give them a chance to succeed at home and at work, the same thing we want for others.', ""But as I have said over and over again to those who crow about the bill, the bill is the beginning, not the end. If you're going to require people to go to work, they have to have a job and the training and the ability to go to work. I have a plan to put a million more jobs out there for welfare recipients in a partnership with the private sector. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'And finally, let me say to all of you, as important as all of this is, we have to remember the fundamental fact of this time. The fundamental fact is whether you live in the smallest town in Maine or Arkansas, whether you live in the biggest cities of America, we will live in a time where all of us will be dominated by the explosion of information and technology, by the breaking down of national barriers in economics, by the traveling of information, ideas, money, and technology across national borders in the speed of light.', 'I just approved a few months ago a joint research project with IBM. We are developing for the next couple of years a supercomputer that will do more calculations in one second than you can go home and do on your handheld calculator in 30,000 years. That is just one example of what is happening in the world.', ""At the National Institutes of Health we are investing in the human genome project which, within a matter of a few years, will enable parents and their newborn babies to take home with them a genetic map of the child's body so that we will know how best to raise each of our children individually, what kind of nutritional needs they have, what kind of exercise needs they have, what kind of medical care they will need. We will be able to expand the quality and the length of life as never before, because of education and research."", 'That means more and more and more, people will need to understand and know and learn for a lifetime, and that means that there is no more important issue before the American people to build that bridge to the 21st century than making education our highest priority.', 'So I want to ask you this—I have so many things—I could talk to you about that until dawn tomorrow, but there are three things I want to talk to you about.', 'Forty percent of the 8-year-olds in this country cannot read a book on their own. I have a proposal to mobilize an army of AmeriCorps volunteers, reading specialists, and others to work with parents and teachers to make sure that by the year 2000 every third grader in this country can pick up a book and say, ""I can read this all by myself."" Will you help me do that? [Applause]', ""Two: Technology gives us a chance to do something we have never been able to do before in the history of America. It gives us a chance to democratize and revolutionize education. If we can see that every classroom in America not only has computers and software and trained instructors who understand it all and at least can keep up with their computer-literate students but also that every classroom is hooked up to the information superhighway, to the Internet, to the World Wide Web, to all of these networks, do you know what that means? Even if you don't understand anything about computers, here's what it means. It's simple. It means that for the first time in history, the children in the most remote districts in America, the children in the poorest school districts in America will have access to the same learning in the same time at the same level of quality as the children in the wealthiest public and private schools in the United States do. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'And finally, as Governor Brennan said, we have to make college available to all. I want to make, in 4 years—in just 4 years, we can make 2 years of education after high school as universal as a high school diploma is today by simply saying, you get a tax credit, a dollarfor-dollar reduction on your tax bill for the typical cost of a community college tuition in America. Will you help me do that? [Applause]', 'The second thing I propose to do is to make it easier for even more families to save money in an IRA but then to withdraw from that retirement account without a penalty if the money is used to buy a first home, to deal with a medical emergency, or to pay for a college education. Will you help me do that? [Applause]', ""And finally, it seems to me that this country would be much stronger if everybody got to deduct up to $10,000 a year for the cost of any college tuition, any cost of education after high school, and it's paid for in our balanced budget plan. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'My fellow Americans, last night was a good night for the American people because we got to hear a discussion of the fundamental choices before us: Are we on our own, or do we believe it takes a village? Are we going to build a bridge to the past or build a bridge to the future? And if we build a bridge to the future, is it going to be wide enough and strong enough for every American to walk across?', ""If the answer is yes, then the best days of this country are still ahead. That is my commitment to you. I hope you'll help me build that bridge for 29 more days."", 'Thank you, and God bless you.']"

And I think unquestionably history will record him as the most effective Secretary of Education our country has had to this point.', 'I thank the students who are behind us. I thank Dr. Clinard for her fine remarks and her fine work. Dr. Al Trivelpiece from the Oak Ridge labs is here. I thank you for being here, sir. I want to say a special word of thanks to Sumner Redstone and to Lynn Forester. Thank you, Lynn, and to all the other business leaders who have agreed to help us on this truly monumental but terribly important project.', ""I'm very, very glad to be here. The Vice President—last night I called to congratulate him on his debate, and I said that Mr. Kemp found out something that I found out a long time ago: It's just as well not to be on the other side of an argument with Al Gore. Although I did think it was rather ungracious of him to mention our annual bet on the Arkansas-Tennessee football game here in the backyard of the University of Tennessee. [Laughter]"", 'Actually, we have a lot to be grateful to the University of Tennessee for. One of the most important members of our administration, Nancy-Ann Min, I believe was the first female president of the student body here. The band came out to the airport to play for us, which was a wonderful thing; it woke us both up this morning, got us off to a good start. [Laughter]', ""Anyway, we always come back around to this football game, you know. And the last few years have been pretty good for Tennessee and not so good for Arkansas, and so I figured that Al's hubris would get the better of him, and since we were in Knoxville I could get more points on the game today. [Laughter] And I'm lobbying. So you're proud of your football team, aren't you? [Applause] So what am I entitled to? Twenty-eight points on the spread? I mean, what do you think? [Laughter]"", ""We got to talking about Tennessee football players, and I pointed out that one of the greatest football players Tennessee ever produced still has ties here in Knoxville, is still playing very well, Reggie White of the Green Bay Packers. He's a good man. I visited Reggie and the Packers not very long ago, and they are truly impressive. But as good as Reggie is, last night it was Al Gore who sacked the quarterback. [Laughter]"", ""Let me say to all of you that the Vice President and I have worked very closely together; we've been a good team. We've worked hard for 4 years to basically change not only the way the National Government works but the way our country is thinking about the future. We want everyone in America to have a vision of what America should be like in the 21st century."", 'And I ask all of you to think about it when you leave here and you go about your business today, just think about it: If you had to set down in a paragraph, sort of say what you think your country ought to be like as we start a new century and a new millennium, in a time where we have radical, breathtaking changes in the nature of work and communications and how we relate to each other and the rest of the world, what would that vision be for you if you were writing it down? I encourage you to do it tonight when you get home. It would be a good exercise. Talk to your spouses, your kids, your parents about it. And think about what do you want for your country when we start this new century.', ""For me, it's this: I want us to take advantage of these changes so that the American dream will be alive and well for everyone who is willing to work for it. I want us to be a country that is coming together, respecting our diversity, and clinging to our shared values instead of being torn apart by our differences, as so many countries all around the world are. Now, who would have thought 15 or 20 years ago at the height of the cold war we could ever see the threat of communism fade from the world, that we would see the ugly rise of old racial and ethnic and religious hatreds consuming people all around the globe? We can beat that rap here, and we're determined to do it, and I think we will do it."", ""The third thing I want is for the United States to continue to be the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and progress and prosperity in the entire world. I think that is important for other people in the world who have their aspirations and who need to have the chance to grow up strong and free, the chance to develop the minds that God gave them and the spirits of their children."", ""To do that, we have followed a simple strategy. We have tried to create as much opportunity as possible. We have tried to demand responsibility from all of our citizens and do things that would encourage more of that. And we've tried to build this American community and stand against those forces that would undermine it. We tried to change the fundamental way the Government works, and Al Gore has been our leader in that regard. We have downsized the Government now by 240,000 people or so. It's the smallest it's been since President Kennedy was in office. But we have also tried to change the way it works, to make it less bureaucratic and more oriented toward working in partnerships with citizens to give people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives."", 'That is the context in which I ask you to see what I believe we should be doing with science and technology and basic research. It has to do with what I want America to look like when we start this new century, what I want it to look like when people like me, when our children are our age, and indeed when our grandchildren are our age.', ""If you have that vision, there is no better way to make it real than by continuing to preserve America's leadership in research and technology and science. Of course, as Al said, there could be a great digital divide. If we don't broadly share the knowledge and the technology that is developing, it could work to promote inequality, frictions, anxieties among people. But if we do it right, it can be a great force to help us meet our challenges and protect our values together."", ""Continuing to push back on the frontiers of knowledge has always been one of the measures of America's greatness. For the last half century, this State of Tennessee has been a living map of how those kinds of investments can produce growth and opportunity. Sixty years ago, the TVA lifted an entire region out of poverty. Today, it is still shining its light, illuminating homes and communities. During the cold war, the Oak Ridge Laboratory harnessed the power of the atom in the service of our Nation's defense. Today, its nuclear science is yielding the isotopes that help doctors trace heart disease. Our interstate highway system, built with the leadership of Senator Al Gore, Sr., literally remade the landscape of America and connected us all more closely. And today it is still bringing Americans together."", 'Technology is clearly transforming our world, and it is creating a range of possibilities for the young people behind me and the young people in this audience that are literally unimaginable. Many of you people who are students at the University of Tennessee who are here and the younger students from high schools and the middle schools, the elementary schools, you will be doing work that has not been invented yet. Some of you will be doing things that have not even been imagined yet. And it is up to us to see that every one of you has the best possible chance to develop your talents and to live out your dreams.', ""This is what has been happening: change at a rapid rate. Again, even if you look back on it, it's almost unimaginable. Consider this: There is today more computer power in a Ford Taurus you drive to the supermarket than there was in Apollo 11 when Neil Armstrong took it all the way to the Moon. Isn't that amazing? Cell phones, faxes, laptop computers, pagers: they were the stuff of science fiction a few years ago. They're now everywhere, and if you don't have one, don't know how to work one, you're sort of out of step. These days you can take notes on a computer pad which converts it into a typed text and sends it to the Internet and transmits it to a computer all across the world."", ""The young people today will live out their lives, in short, in a century that will change like this constantly. And that's why I say they will do work that not only has not been invented yet but some of it has not been imagined yet."", ""Our cutting edge industries like microchips, biotechnology, and aerospace once again lead the world. I'm proud of that, and that's good news for Americans. When it comes to these new technologies, our Nation is on the right track, and that's one of the reasons we're the world's leading exporting country again, one of the reasons we have as many jobs as we do, one of the reasons that more than half of our new jobs are in higher wage categories, because we are on the cutting edge of positive change."", 'So let me say again, we must stay on the cutting edge of positive change. I am determined that we will continue to invest in science and technology. More research in America— most research is conducted by businesses and universities, but we all know that Government has an important role to play.', 'Of the 12 Americans who won the Nobel Prize last year, all 12 had received Government support for their research. This year, the Nobel Prize winners have just been announced in physics and chemistry. Of the three who won this year in physics and two who won in chemistry, all five received Federal funding from the National Science Foundation. Cutting back on research at the dawn of a new century where research is more important than it has been even for the last 50 years would be like cutting our defense budget at the height of the cold war. We must not do it, and we will not do it. We must protect the future of the young people here in the audience.', ""One of the marvelous things we have learned about research is that it's not necessarily going to benefit just a particular category in which it was undertaken, that ideas don't stay in boxes anymore, that they all become more interrelated, the more you know and the more you learn. For example, the Department of Defense has a dual applications program that makes military research available for commercial use. The Commerce Department has an advanced technology program that works with hundreds of high-tech firms to create jobs and new technologies, and let me just give you one example of this."", ""The research we've done in defense and intelligence and in our space program on imaging, which is very, very important, knowing exactly where you are and what you're seeing, is playing enormous benefits in the medical research area, and it may help us to identify incipient cancers before they develop to a problem stage in a way that may drastically improve the cure rate for cancer and almost get the identification down to the point where cure and prevention become merely indistinguishable in the moment. This is the sort of thing we have to be thinking about all of the time."", ""I tell this story all the time, but I think it's important. We just formed a partnership with IBM to produce a supercomputer over the next couple of years that will do more calculations in one second than you can do at home on your hand-held calculator in 30,000 years. Now, that should give you some indication of how quickly things are changing and how we will be rewarded if we stay on the cutting edge and how we can be punished if we don't."", ""I just talked a little bit about health care, but technology is really making enormous strides there, and research is. During the time the Vice President and I have been in office, we've increased research on breast cancer at the National Institutes of Health by almost 80 percent. And just last year, an NIH scientist discovered two of the genes that cause breast cancer, giving hope for treating and preventing the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women."", ""We've increased NIH research on AIDS by 39 percent. And I'm convinced we're in the process of helping to turn a relentlessly fatal disease into a chronic, manageable illness. The life expectancy of those with HIV and AIDS has nearly doubled since I took office because of medical advances in research. We've come up with the first-ever treatment for strokes, the third biggest killer in America, something no one ever thought we would ever be able to do very much on."", ""And just the other day—well, a lot of you were moved, I know, by Christopher Reeve's speech at the Democratic National Convention. And he called for a recommitment to research. At almost the same time, either a couple of days before or a couple of days after Christopher Reeve gave that speech, for the first time ever, laboratory animals whose spine had been severed had movement in their lower limbs because of nerve transplants to the spine from other parts of the body. We can do things that we have never imagined if we continue to work and go forward."", ""Last week I signed budget legislation increasing the NIH budget $2.4 billion over what it was on the day I took office. These investments will make possible further advances. They will lead to sophisticated computer imaging systems to help us treat cancer, to help us deal with Alzheimer's. They will enable us to continue certain extraordinary initiatives going on there. One of my favorites is the human genome project, which is literally on the verge on mapping out a genetic code of life. I think it won't be too many years before parents will be able to go home from the hospital with their newborn babies with a genetic map in their hands that will tell them: Here's what your child's future will likely be like. Therefore, if you want your child to live as long and as well as possible, here is the diet you should follow, here is the exercise program you should follow, here is the medical treatment you should follow. It will be an incredible thing."", ""I know that all of you believe in this, but I think it's important that we have—that ordinary citizens have at their fingertips three or four examples that people can identify with of why these investments of your money—because, after all, this is all your money, these are just things that we do together as a people because we couldn't do them individually—and I think it's important that you have these at your fingertips so that you can talk to your friends and neighbors about why this matters. I know you can make a good speech about it here because you've got Oak Ridge up the road, and it's a lot of good jobs. But it's important to understand why it matters to everyone wherever they live and how it can change our common future for the better."", ""We all know that changes in technology are transforming the way we work, too. For a long time people were worried about that; we all were. Everybody wondered: Well, there's so much computer technology, all of the big organizations, the big bureaucracies can downsize. Will there be more people dislocated than we can create new jobs? Even if we create new jobs, will the new jobs not be as good a job as the ones we're losing? These are legitimate worries that have plagued people in the past and that still trouble individuals in our country, but we now know that we are creating jobs that on average are in the higher wage categories. We know we can do it right."", ""But there is another thing that we ought to look at, which is how we can use technology to help people who have children at home succeed at home and at work. When I became President—and I think it's still true, we don't have any updated figures—but when I became President, there was a study that came out that said that people were working harder in 1994, the second year I was in office, than they had been 25 years earlier in 1969. The average working person was actually spending more hours a week at work. And yet there were a higher percentage of parents in the work force in 1994 than there were in 1969. That means that nearly every family, whether it's a family working for a very modest wage, a family with a solid, middle class existence, even a lot of upper middle class, better-off families are dealing with these competing pressures of trying to do a good job raising their children, which is our most important job, and trying to succeed in the workplace."", ""That's why the Vice President and I worked so hard for the Family and Medical Leave Act, why we believe it ought to be expanded, and why we think there ought to be more flextime in the workplace. But again, I think technology, if we keep working on it, will bring it back around to us, and a lot of people will be able to benefit from it. The number of Americans who are now working from their home at least part of the week and telecommuting has doubled over the last 5 years to 12.1 million."", 'The Small Business Job Protection Act that I signed this summer included an increase in the minimum wage for 10 million working Americans. But it also did something else: It completed a job the Vice President and I started in 1993. We have, since 1993, increased the amount of capital a small business can expense from $10,000 a year now to $25,000 a year. And I believe more and more companies should use this expense to buy computers and other equipment for their employees to use at home, especially if the employees have young children. We have to work harder to make our businesses work well, our employees succeed, and people be able to be good parents.', ""Finally, let me say the explosion of information has changed everyone's life, nowhere more than on the Internet. Now, think about the Internet, how rapidly it's become part of our lives. In 1969 the Government invested in a small computer network that eventually became the Internet. When I took office, only highenergy physicists had ever heard of what is called the World Wide Web. When I took office, January of '93, only high-energy physicists had heard of it. Now even my cat has his own web page. [Laughter]"", 'The number of people on the Web has been doubling every 8 months. Think about that. The number of people on the Web has been doubling every 8 months. Today, there are at least 25 million people on the Internet. By 1998, that number will reach 100 million. The day is coming when every home will be connected to it, and it will be just as normal a part of our life as a telephone and a television. It is becoming our new town square, changing the way we relate to one another, the way we send mail, the way we hear news, the way we play.', ""Every citizen can now read the Congressional Record. If you have insomnia, I recommend it. [Laughter] Every citizen can get the text of what's in a new law the very day it passes. Art lovers can go to the Louvre. Baseball fans can pay an on-line visit to Cooperstown. Everyone can find a passage in the Bible or in Shakespeare with the click of a mouse. Most of all, the Internet will be the most profoundly revolutionary tool for educating our children in generations."", 'I want to see the day when computers are as much a part of a classroom as blackboards and we put the future at the fingertips of every American child. That sounds great, but think about the implications for our American democracy. If you want to go into the 21st century with the American dream alive and well for everyone, everybody has a chance to live up to the fullest of their abilities and, I might add, to be less shackled by whatever disabilities they have, if you believe we can create a community where everybody has a role to play, think about the implications for this.', 'What does this mean, hooking up every classroom? It means if you have the right computers and the right education equipment, software, the right educational software, and properly trained teachers, and then all of these connections are made to the Internet and the World Wide Web and all of the other networks that will be exploding out there, think what this means. This means for the first time ever in history, children in the most rural schools, children in the poorest inner-city school districts, children in standard, middle class communities, children in the wealthiest schools, public or private, up and down the line, will have access in real time to the same unlimited store of information. It will revolutionize and democratize education in a way that nothing ever has in the history of this country. Think about what it means.', 'In the State of the Union Address, I challenged the American people to make sure that all of the libraries and classrooms in the country were hooked up to the information superhighway by the year 2000. I am very, very grateful for the work that has already been done. Businesses, communities, governments, schools have worked all across this country, thousands of schools have been hooked up on NetDays from California to Florida, and today we are taking three more steps to make sure we achieve that critical goal.', ""First, the announcement that has been made by Mr. Redstone. The business community is committed to taking the lead in putting educational technology into our classrooms. CEO's from our top telecommunications firms are joining together to help us achieve that vision. Sumner Redstone, Lynn Forester, also Robert Allen of AT&T, Larry Ellison of Oracle, Gerry Levin of Time-Warner, Brian Roberts of Comcast, Steven Case of America Online, and there will be many more—they're going to make sure that we have the computers in the classrooms, that the teachers are properly trained, that the educational software is the best available, and that all these connections are made to democratize education. They will help to raise private sector contributions to match the technology literacy challenge fund that we have created. And let me say again to Sumner, to Lynn, to all the others: We owe them our thanks, and we need more to follow their lead. This is the only way we can get this done in a short time. [Applause] Thank you."", 'The second thing we have to do is to make sure that all of the schools and the libraries in the country can afford to connect to the Internet. Today, the cost of using the Internet can price some schools out of cyberspace. Fees can be inconsistent, with the highest rates often hitting places with the fewest resources.', 'Soon, all this will change. Under the new telecommunications law I signed a few months ago, the Federal Communications Commission will require that telecommunications service providers give to schools and libraries affordable rates for Internet access. The FCC will vote on how to do this on November 8th—how to provide what we call an E-rate, an education rate. Today I call on the FCC, when it votes, to give every elementary, middle, and high school and every library in the country the lowest possible E-rate: free basic service to the Internet. For more sophisticated services like teleconferencing, the FCC should require discounted rates with the deepest discounts going to the poorest schools and areas. I urge the FCC and the State regulators who have a say in this to make the E-rate a reality for our schools.', ""And again, I want to thank the Vice President and Secretary Riley, Assistant Secretary of Commerce Larry Irving, who's worked with us on this, and there are a number of Members of Congress. The Senators that I would like to mention are Dorgan, Exon, Kerrey, Rockefeller, and Senator Snowe, and Congressman Markey. They have all helped us on this."", ""This is a big deal. Wouldn't it be a shame if we did all this work and there were schools that literally could not access the Internet, if there were libraries in little rural communities that couldn't do it? It is not necessary. This will pay for itself over and over again by increasing the users, the knowledge. It will explode, and we have to do this."", ""Finally, let me say, to keep going we have to keep the Internet itself up to speed. I know it's hard to imagine that the Internet could be getting too old. I find that about myself from time to time. [Laughter] But believe it or not, everything ages, and the Internet is straining under its growing popularity. Like any other piece of critical infrastructure, it has to be repaired and upgraded to meet all our education, medical, and national security needs. It is now time to invest in the next generation of Internet. Today I am pleased to announce our commitment to a new $100 million initiative in fiscal year 1998 to improve and expand the Internet, paid for under our balanced budget plan line by line, dime by dime. America must have an Internet that keeps pace with our future. So let's give America Internet II, the next generation Internet. We have to keep it big enough and fast enough to connect all of our people."", 'Now, this initiative will help universities and research institutions expand the amount of information that Internets can carry through ultrafast fiber-optic networks. It will develop software to eliminate bottlenecks. It will expand the number of addresses on the Internet. It will create powerful new switching computers to create power—to enable universities to communicate with each other 100 to 1,000 times faster than they can today. It will develop the software to carry sound and video from one end of the world to another in real time. It will be capable of transmitting the entire Encyclopedia Britannica in less than a second.', 'These improvements will make the Internet a more important and remarkable part of our own lives. They will enable our Defense Department to send intelligence instantly to our troops on the ground anywhere in the world. They will let doctors in rural areas scan their patients for cancer by tapping into supercomputers at university hospitals a long way away. They will allow Americans to take any class anytime, anywhere, in any subject. They will expand the reach of education programs right here, like the Oak Ridge Education Network and Adventures in Supercomputing. So let us reach for a goal in the 21st century of every home connected to the Internet, and let us be brought closer together as a community through that connection.', ""Let me close with a word of caution that I know I don't need for anybody in this audience in east Tennessee. We cannot idealize technology. Technology is only and always the reflection of our own imagination, and its uses must be conditioned by our own values. Technology can help cure diseases, but we can prevent a lot of diseases by old-fashioned changes in behavior. And we know that as well. Technology can give us a lot of information about why we should act rationally in certain cases. But continuing to hate our friends and neighbors because of their differences—religious, racial, tribal, or ethnic differences—that is an affair of the human heart. And we know that as well."", 'So today let us resolve to keep faith with our future by passing on to our children an information superhighway that will help them to live out their dreams. But let us also resolve to make sure that their dreams are the right dreams so that when we get to this great, grand new century and this remarkable age of possibility, the vision we all share for our future can become real.', 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"
98,William J. Clinton ,"October 10, 1996","[""Thank you. Can you hear me way back there in the back? Thank you. Hello, Dayton! It's good to be back in Ohio. Thank you for being here in such large numbers."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be here today. I want to thank Dennis Lieberman for his enthusiastic welcome and for his leadership of the Democratic Party here in our county. I want to thank the officials and the candidates who are here with me: State Representatives Tom Roberts and Lloyd Lewis; Mariana Brown Bettman; my good friend Peter Sikora. I want to thank my longtime friend Bruce Hornsby for being here and entertaining you today. Let's give him another hand, he's great. [Applause]"", 'I want to thank the musicians from the Omega Baptist Church who sang for us. Thank you. I want to thank those who are on the pre-program, the Ohio Democratic Party chairman, David Leland; Craig Zimmers, Hugh Quill, Judy Dodge, A.J. Wagner, Senator Rhine McLin. And thank you, Tony Capizzi, for your proclamation of today and your memory of the work that was done for peace here in Dayton.', ""And most of all, I want to say a special word of thanks to your Congressman, Tony Hall. I know that all of you know what a good job he's done to represent you, but there may be no one in the Congress who is as admired as Tony Hall, a man who lives his faith every day, a man who takes care of his constituents in Dayton and still has enough left in his mind, in his heart, to care for the children who are hungry and homeless and dispossessed all across the world, and especially those in Bosnia who needed his help when he came to me and no one else would help them. Thank you, Tony Hall, for being a model citizen and a great Member of the United States Congress."", 'Again, let me say, I appreciate October 10th being Dayton Peace Accord Appreciation Day. When the world thinks of Dayton now, it thinks of peace. Here, a little more than a year ago, the leaders of Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia came together through American leadership to end the worst bloodshed in Europe since World War II. What was accomplished here turned Bosnia from war to peace. What was proved here is what was proved that we could do—what we can do when we bring adversaries face to face, when people are determined to resolve their differences instead of carrying them on.', 'We showed that America can be an indispensable nation for peace and freedom at the end of the cold war, in building a new world of peace and freedom and prosperity for the 21st century. And every person from this community should be very proud of the role you played in those accords.', ""I want to mention just a few of your citizens who were involved and that I understand are here in the audience today: Eight nuns from Dayton who were part of the Peace Chain for Bosnia; Eleanor Fluzas, the owner of the Amber Rose Restaurant, which provided food for the Bosnian group while it was in Dayton; Reverend Dale Kurtz, who sent Christmas gifts to Croatia. And I just was told right before I came up here that an Air Force man who was the loadmaster of the C-17 that flew me to Bosnia last January has been transferred to Wright-Patterson, Mark Smith. I understand he's here. If you're here, Mark—there you are—thank you very much, and God bless you. Thank you for your service. Thank you all. Give your fellow citizens a big hand now. They deserve it. [Applause]"", ""Four years ago I came to Dayton to talk about the promise of America—not just our problems but our promise—about what we could do to get our country moving again on the right track. Last night there was a debate between the Vice President and Congressman Kemp. And I don't know how you felt about it, but Jack Kemp learned what I learned a long time ago: You don't want to get on the wrong side of an argument with Al Gore. I was very proud of the work that the Vice President did in that debate last night, talking about what we're trying to do to build America's future together."", ""The real question we face now is, what's our country going to be like when we march into that new century just 4 years from now? America is on the right track. I believe we have to keep it going. Just think, 4 years ago I was elected amid high unemployment and rising frustration, with a vision to change our country to go into the 21st century with the American dream alive and well for every person responsible enough to work for it, a dream that we would not be like Bosnia and so many other countries, torn apart by our racial, religious, and ethnic differences. Instead we would relish them. We'd say we're proud of our diversity, and we're all going forward together, working for that future together."", ""My strategy was simple: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where every one of us has a role to play and a place at the table. Then, you took me on faith; now, you have a record. And what a record it is. You have made it. You have made it, and you should be proud: 10 1/2 million new jobs, 434,000 right here in Ohio; the highest homeownership in 15 years; incomes on the rise for the first time in 10 years; the typical household's income up $1,600 after inflation since our economic plan passed; in the last year the biggest drop in poverty among our children in 20 years; the lowest poverty rate among senior citizens ever recorded. We are on the right track to the 21st century: a new minimum wage increase for 10 million workers; 4 years—4 years of declining crime rates; a million fewer victims; 1.9 million fewer people on welfare; an increase in child support collections for children of almost 50 percent. We are on the right track to the 21st century."", ""In the last Congress, with the help of people like Tony Hall, we stood up to the Republican majority when they tried to divide our Nation with their budget and its unnecessary cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education, the environment, research, and technology. When they shut the Government down, we held fast, and we broke gridlock. And just before the Congress left, we raised the minimum wage, made it easier for small-business people to take out retirements for themselves and their employees, made it easier for people who are self-employed to pay for their health insurance, made it possible for 25 million people to say they won't lose their health insurance anymore just because they changed jobs or because somebody in their family has been sick. We gave families a $5,000 tax credit if they will adopt a child, and there a lot of children out there who need homes. We broke gridlock. We are moving in the right direction. This is the right thing to do."", ""We are better off than we were 4 years ago, but we've got a long way to go to build that bridge to the 21st century. And I came here to Dayton to ask you: Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", ""We have cut our deficit by 60 percent, it's gone down in all 4 years of my administration. No President in this century can say that. That is the record we have made. But we have to finish the job and balance our budget to keep interest rates down and the economy going, and we can do it while protecting Medicare and Medicaid, investing in education and the environment and the research of the future. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'We cut taxes for 15 million of our hardest pressed working families. Now we need a tax cut that goes broadly to all the American middle class, a tax cut for education and childrearing, a tax cut that helps people to buy their own homes or pay for health care costs. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', ""To help people succeed at work and at home, we passed the Family and Medical Leave Act. Twelve million families have taken a little time off from work when a baby was born or a parent was sick, a child was sick, a spouse was sick, without losing their jobs. Now we should expand family and medical leave so that people can go with their relatives to doctor's appointments, to parent-teacher appointments. We ought to give working people more choice in how they take payment for their overtime, either in cash or, if they are needed at home, in time with the family. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", ""We have made a good, strong beginning on health care reform by saying you can't lose your health insurance when you change jobs or when someone in your family has been sick; by ending drive-by deliveries, saying that women and their newborns can no longer be forced out of the hospital within a day of having their babies. We're finally providing some help for people whose families have mental health problems. They deserve medical insurance, too. And at long last, a bill I signed last week, too long in coming, finally says to Vietnam veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange and whose children got spina bifida as a result, you are finally going to get the medical help and the disability you deserve. We are moving in the right direction."", ""But now we have to keep going. Our balanced budget plan gives families who are between jobs when they're unemployed the ability to keep their health insurance for 6 more months. It gives families that are taking care of elderly relatives with Alzheimer's disease respite care. It, in short, helps families to succeed at home and at work and when they're between jobs. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", ""We have the crime rate coming down 4 years in a row because the police are working with the communities to prevent crime as well as to catch criminals. The Brady bill helped, the assault weapons bill helped, putting 100,000 police on the street. We've made a good beginning at that. But now we need to finish the job and finish putting those 100,000 police on the street, target violent gangs, and ban bullets that are designed only to pierce the bulletproof vests of police officers. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", ""We have reduced the welfare rolls by 1.9 million and increased child support collections. We've passed historic welfare reform. But the law is just the beginning. The law says we will continue to provide for poor families, their medical care, their nutritional needs, when the parent goes to work more for child care than ever. But what used to come from the Federal Government to the States and then go to the recipients in the form of a welfare check must be turned into a paycheck within 2 years if people are able-bodied. But you can't make people go to work unless there is work. Will you help me build a million more jobs into our economy to move people from welfare to work? [Applause]"", 'We have taken chemicals out of our air, made our drinking water safer, raised the standards of safety for our food. We have cleaned up more toxic waste dumps than the previous 12 years provided. We have done much to protect our national parks and to expand the number of national treasures we are protecting for our children and our grandchildren. But there are still 10 million American children living within 4 miles of toxic waste dumps. I want to clean up 500 more so that we can say our kids are growing up next to parks, not poison. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century?

The young people who are here today in this audience—and I'm glad to see so many young people here—the young people who are here, many of you will be doing jobs that have not been invented yet. Some of you will be doing jobs that have not been imagined yet."", ""I'll just give you one example. We just signed a contract, the United States Government did, to do a research contract with IBM to build within the next couple of years a supercomputer that will do more calculations in one second than you can do at home on your hand-held calculator in 30,000 years. That is how fast information is exploding."", 'We have doubled the life expectancy for people living with HIV in the last 4 years because of the exploding knowledge. We have finally developed some medical treatments for people with strokes, the third biggest killer of Americans. We have discovered two genes that cause breast cancer, opening the possibility of cure and prevention that we never had before, in just the last 4 years. In just the last few weeks, for the first time ever, a laboratory animal with its spine completely severed had movement in its lower limbs because of a nerve transplant to the spine from another part of the body. There is no telling what we can do if we continue to move forward with education and research, pushing the boundaries of knowledge. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', 'But there are some specific things we have to do. Forty percent of the 8-year-olds in America still can\'t read a book on their own. And when that happens, it\'s hard for them to go on and learn what else they need to learn. I want to mobilize an army of 30,000 volunteers— AmeriCorps volunteers, reading tutors, people who will work with parents and with teachers— to make sure that every 8-year-old in this country by the year 2000 can hold up a book and say, ""I can read this all by myself.""', ""We have the largest number of children starting school this year in American history. I have offered the first support ever from the National Government to help our schools modernize and rebuild their facilities if they're willing to make an extra effort. If people at the local community level are willing to make an extra stretch, so should we. We need to give our children the facilities necessary for learning to take place. Will you help me do that? [Applause]"", ""The next thing we need to do is to make sure that every classroom in every school in the United States of America and every library is hooked up to the information superhighway, with computers and training and software connected to the Internet. Now, that may not mean much to you if, like me, you're not so great on a computer. Let me tell you what it means. It means that for the first time in the history of the United States, because of the computer networks that are out there now, what we loosely call the Internet, if we could hook every classroom up to it, for the first time in history, kids in the most remote rural school districts, kids in the poorest inner-city school districts, kids in standard middle class school districts, kids in the wealthiest school districts, kids in schools, public and private, for the first time in history would all have access to the same information in the same time at the same quality; it would lead to an explosion of learning. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century?

We are going forward.', ""And finally, we have to open the doors of college education to all Americans. I propose to do three things that I want you to support. Number one, we need to make 2 years of college in the next 4 years just as universal as a high school diploma is today. Here's how we can do that—no bureaucracy, no program. I propose to give you a tax credit, a dollar-for-dollar reduction on the tax bill for the cost of tuition at the typical community college in America. It would revolutionize opportunity for people of any age."", 'Number two, I propose to let more American families save through an IRA, an individual retirement account, save more, save at even higher income levels, and then withdraw from that account, tax-free, if the money is being used to pay for a college education, a medical emergency, or to buy a first home. Will you help me do that? [Applause]', 'And finally, I believe that Americans should be able to deduct up to $10,000 a year for the cost of any college tuition for any people of any age at any place of higher education in the entire United States. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', ""Folks, we need to build a country where every 8-year-old can read independently, where every 12-year-old can log on to the Internet, where every 18-year-old can go to college, and where every 18-year-old's parent can go back to college if that's what we need in this country. And I want you to help me build that bridge to the 21st century."", ""That is the choice in this election: a bridge to the future, a bridge where everyone can walk across, a bridge where we walk across hand in hand, not divided but united toward America's best days.

He is a great leader."", 'I want to thank your Congressman, Mike Ward. And I want you to know it is rare— it is rare for a first-term Member of Congress to have the kind of influence and make the kind of impact that Mike Ward has made. He works hard for you.

We will do it. Let\'s just talk about something else. Take care of the people of Louisville, and let\'s go on into the future.""', ""And I want you to know that I am grateful that Wendell Ford and your former Congressman, Rom Mazzoli, voted in 1993 for an economic plan that got this country moving again, and I'm grateful that Mike Ward stood up and said no when the other party got control of the Congress and shut the Government down to try to force the United States of America and the President to take a budget that was wrong for America and wrong for our future. Thank you."", ""I want to thank Steve Beshear for being willing to run for the United States Senate and for making an outstanding candidate. You heard his speech tonight.

And there's one person who is not here tonight, but I want to mention him because he's a great friend of mine, your Jefferson County judge and county executive, David Armstrong. We were born in the same little town in Arkansas a long time ago. He's a great friend, and he's away because of a family crisis, and I hope you all will support him. He's got a sick brother. Say a prayer for him tonight and support David Armstrong. He's a fine man, and I'm glad to be here."", ""And finally, I want to thank the mayor. What a mayor you have. I thought I had energy till I met Jerry Abramson. I thought I was aggressive till I met Jerry Abramson. I thought I was exuberant till I met Jerry Abramson. And all those things he said to you that we did together for the people of this city, they're all true, but they couldn't have happened without the leadership of Jerry Abramson. I thank him very much."", ""I'd like to thank the Kentucky Ramblers and the Rascals of Ragtime for providing our entertainment before I got here. I'm glad to be able to visit the Louisville Slugger factory. I'm sorry I couldn't be here in July when the museum opened. This is an amazing place with an amazing history that started the day Pete Browning broke his bat playing for Louisville's Eclipse team. Today, there are millions of bats made here, still made by hand. And I want you to know, since I was a little boy, I've had a lot of them but none I'll treasure any more than the one I got tonight. Thank you very, very much."", ""Folks, 4 years ago I came to Louisville to talk to you about fighting for the ordinary Americans who make our country go, about turning the direction of our country around, about paving a good way for Americans to the 21st century. In the last two debates, the one that I had with my opponent on Sunday night and in the great performance the Vice President put in last night—I was so very proud of him, and I know you were—we saw two very different visions for America, two good people on the other side who love our country but just see things differently than we do. I believe that we've got an obligation to work together to help each other make the most of our own lives. I believe that the First Lady was right when she said it takes a village to raise our children and to build a country that's strong. And what you have to decide is whether you think we have to do this together or whether we're better off going into the 21st century on our own."", ""Now, let's look at where we were. Four years ago when I came here we had high unemployment, stagnant wages, and rising frustration. I was determined to change the direction of America. I wanted to go into the 21st century with the American dream alive and well for every person in this audience, without regard to your station in life, who's willing to work for it. I wanted our country to beat the odds in this modern world. I wanted to prove that we could come together amidst all of our religious and racial and other diversity to prove that we can go forward together."", ""In the rest of the world, people are bedeviled everywhere by their religious differences, their tribal differences, their racial differences, their ethnic differences. But here in America, we say, if you show up tomorrow and you're a lawabiding citizen who works hard and believes in this country, you're our kind of American. We don't need to know anything else about you. Come on, let's go on together. Let's go on together. And for 4 years now we've worked hard to create opportunity, to demand responsibility, and to build a sense of community where everybody's got a role to play and everybody has a place at the table."", 'Four years ago, Kentucky helped me win reelection. I never will forget when Wendell Ford called me, and he said, ""You\'ve got to come to Kentucky one more time. Go to western Kentucky. You haven\'t been over there."" In the middle of the night, seems like we were in western Kentucky. And the people of Kentucky voted for Bill Clinton and Al Gore. Now, Wendell still takes credit for it. He said if we hadn\'t come back that one last time, it would have never happened. [Laughter] And he may be right, but I\'m glad you did. You took us on faith.', ""The American people don't have to take us on faith anymore. Now there's a record. You know whether we were right or wrong. We have 10 1/2 million new jobs in this country. Unemployment in this State has dropped nearly a third. We have record numbers of new small businesses. Every one of them has been eligible now and been made eligible for a tax cut if they invest more to grow their businesses. Every one of them now—it's been easier for them to take out pensions for themselves and their employees and for people to take those pensions from job to job. That's better than it was 4 years ago."", ""It's easier now for self-employed people to take out health insurance because they can deduct more of it from their taxes. That's better than it was 4 years ago. Median income—that's the people in the middle; that's not the average with all of us at the top; that's the people in the middle—have gone up almost $1,600 after inflation since Rom Mazzoli and Wendell Ford voted for the economic plan that we didn't get a single, solitary vote from, from the other side."", ""We're moving in the right direction, folks. We're on the right track to the 21st century."", ""We've had the largest drop in child poverty in 20 years. Now all economic groups that are working are participating in our economic growth. We've had the biggest drop in inequality among working people in 27 years. We've got the lowest rates of inflation and unemployment in home mortgages in 28 years. And last week we learned that the poverty rate among elderly Americans has dropped to its lowest level ever recorded. We are moving in the right direction. We are going to the 21st century."", ""We're getting back to our basic values. The crime rate has dropped for 4 years in a row. There are one million fewer crime victims this year. We made 12 million families eligible to take a little time off from work when a baby is born or a parent or a spouse or a child is sick. The welfare rolls are down by 1.9 million. Child support collections are up almost 50 percent, nearly $4 billion. We're moving in the right direction toward the 21st century."", ""And yes, while we brought the deficit down, we knew there was a right way and a wrong way to do it. And I am proud that we stopped the other party's budget from becoming law, because it would have broken up the Medicare system. It would have cut too much and cost innocent elderly people too much. It would have ended the guarantee that Medicare gives and has given for three decades to the elderly people in nursing homes, so their children can go on and live their own lives and know their parents are going to be all right. It would have ended the guarantee we give to working class families who have people with disabilities in them, so they don't have to go into bankruptcy to take care of their loved ones."", 'I think we did the right thing. It would have devastated environmental protection, environmental cleanup, and for the first time ever would have cut education funding by $30 billion, ending the AmeriCorps national service program, weakening the college loan program we worked so hard to improve, cutting back on Head Start, and generally dividing the country and taking it in the wrong direction.', ""Instead, we said no. We like more jobs, better education, a cleaner environment, and a brighter future. We're going to keep on the right track to the 21st century."", ""And just in the last few days of this Congress, because of you—not because of me but because of you—because you sent a clear signal that you wanted our country to go forward, we passed a lot of our initiatives. We passed the minimum wage bill. We passed a bill that says to 25 million Americans, you can't lose your health insurance anymore just because you changed jobs or somebody in your family's been sick. We said to mothers and their newborn babies, you cannot be kicked out of the hospital anymore after a day, no more drive-by deliveries. We're going to help people with mental health problems to get more insurance. At long last, we said to Vietnam veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange and whose children have spina bifida, finally, finally, we said, we're going to give you and your families and your children some help for medical help and for disability payments. It's about time. We're moving in the right direction."", ""That's why every major law enforcement organization has endorsed Bill Clinton and Al Gore. That's never happened for anyone on our side before. That's why just the day after our debate in Hartford, 2,500 business leaders, including a very large number of them who never voted for a Democrat for President, endorsed our campaign, because they know that it's good for America for us to move forward together. And I want you to help me finish building that bridge to the 21st century."", 'And so that\'s the decision now before the American people: Are we going to back where we were, or are we going to keep going forward? Are we going to go forward together, or are we going to say, ""You\'re on your own""? I think I know what you want to say. We cut the deficit by 60 percent; let\'s keep interest rates down and grow the economy by balancing the budget while we protect Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment.', ""Let's have a tax cut for working families and middle class families, targeted to childrearing, to education, to health care, to buying that first home and paying no taxes on your home when you sell it, but let's pay for it in a balanced budget plan. Let's don't have that risky tax scheme that the other side offers: $550 billion, no idea how they're going to pay for it. I'll tell you what it means: It means bigger cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, education and the environment than I vetoed. Their plan would raise taxes on 9 million of the hardest pressed working families, and it would blow a hole in the deficit a mile wide."", 'Folks, when I became President, we had quadrupled the debt of the country in 4 years, the deficit was $290 billion, people could not borrow money to buy a home. We now have the highest rate of homeownership in 15 years. I just came from Dayton, Ohio, and a 40-yearold man came up to me and said, ""Mr. President, I just bought my first home because we got interest rates down and a healthy economy."" Let\'s don\'t go back, folks, let\'s go forward. Say no to their plan and yes to ours.', ""We passed that Family and Medical Leave Act. We passed the V-chip to give families the ability to control what their children see on television. We got 3 hours of educational television coming back on primetime for families so their kids will have something good to see. The entertainment industry's agreed to rate their TV programs. We're moving forward in the right direction."", 'Now we ought to expand family leave and say people should get a little time off to take their children to a parent-teacher conference or their parents to the doctor. People that earn overtime, if they need it, ought to be able to take the overtime in time with their kids or in cash, at their discretion. Will you help me build that kind of bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', ""We made a good start on health care reform. Our balanced budget plan says, now we ought to help people who are between jobs. When you lose your job, you ought to be able to hold on to your health insurance and take care of your kids. Our plan would help people keep their health insurance for 6 more months when they're between jobs. It's all paid for. It would help families with parents with Alzheimer's to care for them. It would help do other things to prevent illness, and it would continue our ground-breaking work in medical research."", ""In the last 4 years, we've found two genes that cause breast cancer. Now we may be able to find out not only how to treat it but how to prevent it. Just in the last few weeks, for the first time in history—for the first time in history in the last few weeks, we saw laboratory animals with their spines completely severed regain movement in their lower limbs because of nerve transplants to their spine. Who knows what we can do if we keep on working for health care reform. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'We did pass the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban. And in places like Kentucky, our opponents, they made hay while the Sun shown. Oh, they said, ""Oh, they\'re going to take all their guns away."" You know something? It\'ll soon be deer season, won\'t it? I\'ll give $100 to the first hunter in Kentucky who tells me he can\'t go out into the deer woods because he lost his rifle. Not a single person has lost a hunting weapon, but 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers could not get handguns because of the Brady bill. And now people who beat up their spouses and children won\'t be able to get it either. We were right about that, and this is a safer country because of it.', 'And yes, we are putting 100,000 police on the street. But our friends on the other side, they all voted against it. Then they tried to stop us in their budget that I vetoed, then they tried to stop us again.', ""Now, just talk to the mayor or talk to the local chief of police or talk to anybody in law enforcement. I don't understand why anybody would be against that, but they are. One good argument for Steve Beshear and Mike Ward is that they know that what we have to do is give power back to people in the local communities to work with the community crime watch programs, like the one that Carolyn MacLuton has worked so hard for all of these years. God bless you, ma'am. We love you, and thank you for what you're doing."", ""We're trying to get a million more people like her and finish putting 100,000 police on the street.

Let me tell you what that welfare reform bill does. It says this: The National Government will continue to guarantee—they'll fix that in a minute, don't you all worry about it— the National Government will continue to guarantee health care and nutrition to poor families. And if someone goes to work there will be more money for child care than ever before. But what used to come from Washington in the form of a welfare check with State money will now go to Governor Patton. And States and communities will have 2 years to figure out how to turn that welfare check into a paycheck, because able-bodied people who can work, have to work. That's good, but we have to create the jobs. I've got a plan to help the communities create another million jobs to move those people from welfare to work. Will you help me create those jobs and build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", ""We've made the water cleaner. We've made the air cleaner and freer of chemicals. We've raised the standards for food safety. We've cleaned up more toxic waste dumps in 3 years than the other side did in 12. We're cleaning up the environment, but there are still 10 million kids in this country who live within 4 miles of a toxic waste dump.

And that makes a lot of sense, except that this is a democracy. The Government is you. It belongs to you.', ""The other view at one time might have been that most of our problems had to be solved by Government, but we've abandoned that long ago. I wanted to break out of this old debate when I became President and ask Americans to look to the future with common sense and a compassionate heart, to create a future in which there is opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and in which we all have a role to play and a place in this mosaic of America's community. And to me, what we need is a Government that is smaller and less bureaucratic. And we have, by the way, reduced the size of the Government and the burden of its regulations by more than our friends on the other side did in the 12 years they had to do it."", ""But the difference is, I believe that the Government should be smaller and less bureaucratic, but there are some things that we can do together better than we can do them alone. Sometimes we do them in our work units. Sometimes we do them in our religious institutions. Sometimes we do them in our organizations, our clubs, our charities, our nonprofits. Sometimes we do them in city and county government. Sometimes we do them in the State government. But there are some things that we do better together as a nation; we do. And that's the difference."", 'I think this is a better country because we made a national commitment to low-cost student loans that are even better and more affordable than they were before. That is not something you could have done on your own.', ""I believe this is a better country because we gave people like Karoline Smith a chance to move from welfare to education to work, to succeed at home as a parent and in the workplace. I think that's a national obligation. I think we're better."", ""I think this is a better country because we took action to protect Yellowstone National Park from a gold mine, because I signed a bill just this morning before I flew out here to continue our work to recover and preserve the Florida Everglades, because a few days ago I followed in the steps of Theodore Roosevelt and took Executive action to protect the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah. I believe it's a better country because of that."", ""I believe this is a better country because we have invested more in research, because in the last 4 years we have uncovered two of the genes which cause breast cancer among women and which may permit us not only to cure it but to prevent it in the future. That's something we had to do together, and we did it together."", ""I believe we're a better country because of the money we put into research in dealing with drugs to help deal with HIV and AIDS, and the life expectancy has more than doubled in just 4 years. We are a better country because of that. We are a better country because of that."", ""Many of you just heard at the Democratic Convention in Chicago Christopher Reeve's moving address calling for a recommitment to medical research. About the same time, for the very first time ever, a laboratory animal whose spine had been completely severed had movement in its lower limbs because of nerve transplants to the spine from other parts of the body. This is a better country. And if we can do that for people, it will be a much better country. And you can't do that by yourself; we have to do that together. We're a better country because of that."", ""So this election is whether we're going to build a bridge to the future that we can all walk across together, or we're all going to try to build our separate little bridges. This election is whether we are better off saying you're on your own and anybody you elect to office immediately becomes your enemy and a big part of the problem, or whether you think my wife was right, it does take a village to build a country and bring us together and go forward."", ""It is true, as Tom Strickland said, that we're better off than we were 4 years ago. And I'm grateful for the chance to have been a part of that. You deserve a lot of the credit. Our role was to create the conditions and give you the tools to make the most of your own lives. But we do have more jobs, lower unemployment, much higher incomes—average income finally going up for the first time in a decade, about $1,600 after inflation in the last 2 years alone for middle class people."", ""I'm especially proud that last year we had the biggest drop in inequality among all classes of people who are working for a living in 27 years, the biggest drop in child poverty in 20 years, and the lowest poverty rate among American senior citizens ever recorded. I'm proud of that. We're moving in the right direction."", ""I'm proud that the crime rate has gone down for 4 years in a row. And I know and you know that most of the credit goes to the people who are out there on the street, the police officers, the others in the criminal justice system, the citizens of this country, and I might add also, the teachers, the parents, the community leaders who are trying to keep our kids out of trouble in the first place. I'm proud of that."", ""But we had 30 years of evidence. In 30 years before I became President, the violent crime rate tripled; the police forces of this country increased by only 10 percent. We were right to say this is something we should do together as a nation to put 100,000 more police on the street, to pass the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban to make this a safer country. It was the right thing to do; we're a stronger, better country because of it."", 'Now, I know when we did some of these things, a lot of people thought it was wrong in Colorado. And a lot of people thought it was wrong in my native State of Arkansas, where half the people have a hunting or a fishing license or both—actually, more than half. And they were all told—I got all these calls in Washington from people who still call me Bill, or worse—[laughter]—from home saying, ""They say you\'re going to take my guns away."" I said, ""I\'ll tell you what, I\'ll buy you a new rifle if you miss a single hunting season because of the Brady bill or the assault weapons ban.""', ""Well, it's been 2 years, and you heard the statistics: tens of thousands of felons, fugitives, and stalkers lost their handguns. We didn't take any hunting rifles away; we took weapons away. And now people who beat up their spouses and their children can't buy handguns either. And I think we're a better country because of it. I think we're a better country because of it."", ""So I ask you to think about the future. Think what happened—I think most everybody instinctively knows that it's right—look what happened in the last couple of weeks when your voices began to be heard in Washington; then an agenda that I had been advocating for 2 years all of the sudden became popular. We said you can't lose your health insurance anymore just because you changed jobs or somebody in your family's been sick. We said insurance companies can't force hospitals to kick women and their newborn babies out of the hospital after a day. We're finally going to help families that have— families that need some help with mental health coverage to get that."", ""We are finally going for the—we did something else that I'm particularly proud of for the very first time in history."", 'Audience member. Let me hear it. [Laughter]', ""The President. That's good. Keep doing that. That's good. [Laughter]"", ""For the very first time in history, in a bill I signed just a few days ago, we are giving benefits to the children of American veterans who were injured because of their parents' service, because a lot of servicemen in Vietnam were exposed to Agent Orange and, terribly, some of their children got spina bifida. Finally, after all these years we're going to give them health care and disability payments that they need. And I'm proud of that. That's something we had to do together."", ""I think we did the right thing to raise the minimum wage for 10 million people. I think we did the right thing to say that we heard the cries of small-business people. We made every small business in the country eligible for a tax cut if they invest more in their business. We made it easier for them to take out pensions and for their employees to do so and to keep those pensions when they move from job to job—really important. Most of you work for small business today, and only half the American people have a good pension plan. And we made people who were self-employed eligible for a bigger tax deduction if they have to insure themselves. I'm proud that we did that. I think we're a stronger country."", ""I'm also glad we gave a $5,000 tax credit to people who will adopt children. There are lots of children out there that need homes, and we did the right thing."", ""So I guess Karoline was right: We started building that bridge to the 21st century 4 years go, but we've got a ways to go. Yes, we've reduced the deficit by 60 percent, 4 years in a row, first time that's happened in this century. I'm proud of that. But we ought to go on and balance the budget because that will keep interest rates down and America growing and prosperity coming. But we have to do it in a way that protects our obligations to each other, the things that we should be doing together."", 'We should reform Medicare, not wreck it. We should not walk away from the guarantee Medicaid gives to help working families whose parents are in nursing homes, who have children with disabilities. We should not walk away from pregnant women and little children. We should continue that. And we definitely should not undermine our investment in our future by cutting back on education, the environment, research, and technology.', ""Because the economy is strong and the deficit has been reduced, we should build on the tax cuts that have been passed in the last 4 years. We cut taxes for all small businesses, for 15 million of our hardest pressed working families. We can do more. But we ought to pay for it line by line. We shouldn't promise you we can do something we can't pay for and then blow up the deficit, wind up seeing bigger cuts than the ones I vetoed, weakening our economy."", ""So I want tax cuts that are paid for in my balanced budget, targeted to the things you need the most, to childrearing, to education, to buying a first home, not paying taxes when you sell your home, investing in health care. These are things we can afford. We ought to have them, and we will have them if you'll help us build that bridge to the 21st century."", ""We have more work to do in helping people to succeed at home and at work. I'm very proud the first bill I signed was the family and medical leave law. Again, I say, this is a classic example of this dilemma. If you believe that the Government is them and you are us, and you know best and people you elect don't know anything, that the minute you vote for them they lose all sense of connection with you, then you might agree with my opponent that the family and medical leave law was a terrible idea."", ""But I believe the biggest challenge we face today as a people is helping good, hard-working people to meet the conflicting demands of parenthood and work. Most parents are working. We're a stronger country because 12 million people got to take some time off when a baby was born or sick, or a parent or a spouse was sick, without losing their job. We're a better, stronger country, and our economy proves it. That's the kind of thing we ought to be doing, and we ought to build on it and make it stronger."", ""We passed this welfare reform bill after we had reduced the welfare rolls by 1.9 million— Karoline's one of them—1.9 million people moving into a more productive life, becoming educated, becoming taxpayers instead of receivers of tax dollars."", ""The new law says this—this is the challenge for the Governor and others in State government and for the county commissioners here and people in local government—it says we will continue to guarantee to people who are poor health care for themselves and their children and nutrition and, if they go to work, more for child care than ever before. But the portion of the Federal money that used to go to people in a monthly check will now be sent to the States, where they and the local communities will have 2 years to figure out how to turn everyone who's like Karoline into Karoline, to move people from welfare to work. That is the right thing to do. And I have a plan to help create a million jobs for those people. You cannot make people go to work unless they have work. Will you help me do that and build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'But if you think about the future of Colorado and you look around here in this hallowed place, no two issues more define the future of this State than the decisions we make as a people on the environment and, even more, on education.', 'You know, when I was talking to Tom Strickland before we came out here, I said, ""I can\'t go out there and ask them to vote for you just because you\'re a Democrat. Most people don\'t care that much about it. Why do you want this job? Why do you want this job? Why are you doing this? This other guy\'s a Member of Congress. He\'s got all this money. He\'s hard to beat. It\'s a rigorous endeavor. Why are you doing this?""', 'And he said, ""Because I want my children to grow up in a State and a nation that preserves instead of destroys its natural heritage and because I want every child in this country to have the same chance my kids are going to have. And we cannot afford to continue the direction that the present Congress tried to take to undermine the environment and to walk away from our common obligation to educate all our people."" That\'s a pretty good reason to vote for somebody for the United States Senate. That\'s a pretty good reason.', 'Folks, those Senators get a long term. They get 6 years. That\'s longer than the President gets. And they get to run more than once which means they get to serve longer than a President can serve. And there\'s something I think you all ought to think about, whatever your party or philosophy is, when you look at somebody who wants to go the Senate and says, ""Give me a 6-year term, and by the way, I might ask you for another one and I might ask you for another one after that,"" you have to imagine what will happen to this person in those 6 years. Does this person have the capacity to continue to absorb all the changes that are going on in America, to feel the needs of all the people in this country, to understand when to say yes and when to say no and to grow into greatness in that role? I think Tom Strickland does. And that\'s another good reason to vote for him for the United States Senate, and I hope you will.', ""So let me say to you, the air and the drinking water is cleaner than it was 4 years ago. Our food safety standards are higher than they were 4 years ago. We saved an attack on our national parks, and we've done everything we could to expand them with new important preservation of our previous heritage. But we have more to do."", ""Do you know that two-thirds of our toxic waste dumps are very serious and that 10 million children still live within 4 miles of a toxic waste dump? So if you'll give us 4 more years, among other things we'll do on the environment is clean up those 500 dumps, so our kids will be growing up next to parks, not poison. Will you help us do that? [Applause]"", 'And the last thing I want to ask you to do is to help me implement our education agenda.

But let me tell you, in the next 4 years, if we have the will and vision to do it, we can make 2 years of education after high school just as universal as a high school diploma is today. And I know how to do it. I want to give the American people a tax credit, a dollar-for-dollar reduction on their taxes for the cost of the typical community college tuition in America. It would be the best money we ever spent. Will you help me do that?

Right before the Congress was over, 25 million Americans will potentially benefit from the bill we passed that says you can't lose your health insurance anymore just because you change jobs or someone in your family has been sick. Just before Congress was over, we finally passed a bill that did something you had already done in New Mexico, ending those drive-by deliveries.

And let me say to you, one of the things that I have tried to do is to change the way we think about our purposes and working together as a people, the way we think about our responsibilities as citizens. I don't think like all that debate that goes on, or did go on in Washington for 10 or 12 years: liberal this, conservative that; this is a Democratic issue, that's a Republican issue; this is on the left, that's on the right."", ""You know, if I could go to dinner with any of those 42 people or 67 people Bill says have invited me to dinner—I'd like to do that, by the way—[laughter]—if I could do that and I could just sit there and not say a word, I'll bet you $100 that we wouldn't have that kind of sterile rhetoric. People would be talking about their hopes and their dreams for their children, the challenges they face on the job, how they can succeed in raising their kids and succeed in the work place, what's this country going to be like in 20 years.

Yes, the Government cannot solve all your problems with a big bureaucracy. That Government is gone. It was our administration—not our friends in the other party, our administration—with the support of Jeff Bingaman and Bill Richardson, and the opposition of our friends in the other party, that cut the size of the Federal Government to its lowest since John Kennedy was President and reduced more regulations in 3 years than they did in 12. We did that."", 'But I\'ll tell you what, I believe that the National Government\'s responsibility is to do those things that we must do together. My opponent says, ""Oh, the President thinks the Government knows best."" But I think you know best. Now, if we fall for that one again, we ought to be ashamed of ourselves. Their theory is, you know, that once you get elected to public office you no longer belong to the people, you lose all your common sense, and you become the enemy, unless you\'re a Republican, in which case you don\'t. [Laughter]', 'Their theory is that the Government is always the enemy. Read the Constitution: ""We the people . . ."" The Government is you. It belongs to you. It is a reflection of what you want. It is nothing more or less than yours. And I believe that our role is to create the conditions and then give you the tools to make the most of your own lives. I believe that we\'re supposed to help communities to fulfill their dreams and individuals and families to do the same. I\'m glad to support more communities in doing what Albuquerque had done, for example, in establishing a curfew that\'s lowering juvenile crime and keeping our kids safer. I think that\'s one of my jobs.', ""I want to finish the job of putting 100,000 police on the street. All we're doing is funding it. Those police are working for you on the streets in all the communities of this country, and that's one of the reasons we've got a 10year low in crime."", ""Those are the things that we are doing. The family and medical leave law has helped 12 million American families to get a little time off from work without losing their jobs when a baby is born or a baby, a spouse, or a parent is sick. And we have a stronger economy because of it, not a weaker economy. That's one of our jobs."", ""I believe there ought to be a national program to guarantee that every young person, and now not-so-young people, who want and need to go to college—every single person who is willing to work for it ought to be able to go. I think that's a good thing for our country."", ""I believe we were right to fight against our friends in the other party when they tried to cut the funds for safe and drug-free schools. I think we need to help our kids in the beginning and help them stay out of trouble so we won't have to spend as much time and money and heartbreak and blood when they get in trouble. The safe and drug-free schools program is a good program, and I think we were right."", ""And let me say, because I believe we have to build a bridge to 21st century that will take us into a time full of greater prosperity and greater possibility than we've ever known, a bridge that's big enough for all of us to walk across, I want to say a special word of thanks to another community group that is here. We have hundreds of young people here today from the Bridge Builders to the 21st Century. Hold your hands up, everybody that's here. These young people have joined together to pledge that they will do everything they can to make their schools drug-free and to encourage every single citizen of the State of New Mexico to vote on election day. Let's give them a big hand. I'm proud of them. [Applause] Thank you."", 'So I say to you, there are big consequences to which path we choose to take. My bridgebuilding calls for the following path: Should we balance the budget? You bet we should. It keeps interest rates down, keeps the economy growing, takes the burden of debt off these children. But we have to do it in a way that honors our obligations to each other and continues to invest in the future. So, yes, balance the budget, but we can do it without wrecking Medicare, Medicaid, education, the environment, or abolishing the laboratories of the Department of Energy and undermining our research budget.', ""We should cut taxes, but we shouldn't embrace a big tax scheme that actually raises taxes on 9 million of our hardest working people, blows a hole in the deficit which will increase interest rates and weaken the economy and require bigger cuts than the budget I vetoed when they shut the Government down. Let's try my tax cut. It's targeted to education, to childrearing, to buying a home, to dealing with a medical emergency, and not paying taxes on your home when you sell it if there's a gain. We can pay for that, and we need it."", ""One of the biggest differences I had with our friends on the other side was their obsession with weakening our ability to work together to protect our environment. They said we were hurting the economy by protecting the environment. Well, all I know is that the air is cleaner, the drinking water is safer, we have raised the standards for food safety, we've cleaned up more toxic waste dumps in 3 years than the previous administrations did in 12. And we've still got faster job growth than any administration under the previous party had since the 1920's, in 70 years. It's a good thing to protect the environment, and I intend to continue to do it."", 'Finally, and most important of all, we have got to build a bridge to the 21st century in which the education of every single American is our highest priority. Will you help me do that? [Applause]', 'Forty percent of the third graders in America still cannot read a book independently. I want to mobilize 30,000 volunteers, AmeriCorps volunteers, reading specialists, to work with parents and teachers so that in 4 years, when we start that new century, every 8-year-old in this country can pick up a book and say, ""I can read this all by myself.""

[Applause]', 'I want to make sure we connect every single, solitary classroom and library in America to the information superhighway; to make sure we have the computers, the educational materials, the trained teachers; and most important, that all these classrooms are connected to the Internet, the World Wide Web, all these networks.', ""Now, if you're not a big computer person, you may not understand exactly what that means. Let me tell you what that means in practical terms. It means for the first time in history, children in the poorest rural school districts in America, children in every Native American schoolroom, children in every innercity school, children in every suburban school, children in the poorest, the most middle class, and the wealthiest schools, public and private, in America for the first time ever, they will all have access to the same information in the same time in the same way. Will you help me do that? [Applause]"", 'And finally, we can make a college education available to all Americans. And I propose to do it in three ways: Number one, I want you to be able to save in an IRA but withdraw from it without any penalties if you\'re spending your savings for a college education or medical costs or buying a first-time home. Number two, I propose to make 2 years of education after high school as universal as a high school diploma is today by simply saying, ""You can take off of your tax bill, dollar for dollar, the cost of the typical community college tuition for 2 years."" Will you help me do that? [Applause] And finally, I believe you ought to be able to deduct from your taxes—you ought to be able to deduct up to $10,000 a year from your taxable income for the cost of college tuition, any kind of college, for people of any age. Will you help me do that? [Applause]', 'My fellow Americans, we are better off than we were 4 years ago and not just in economic terms, for this is not just about the economy. This is about what kind of America we want our children to live in. And I think every day— every day I think, what do I want my country to be like when we start that new century? What do I want my country to be like when my daughter is my age, when her children are my age?', 'And before you vote, I hope you will take just a little time and see if you can ask yourself, ""Can I say in 30 seconds or a minute what I want America to be like when we start that new century, when my children are my age, when my grandchildren are my age?"" If you will ask the question, I bet you will get an answer not very different than mine.', 'And then we will build that bridge to America\'s best days. There are 23 days left. I ask every one of you here today to take some time not only to vote but to reach out to others, to be a good citizen, to influence those whom you can influence and say, ""Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century?""', 'Thank you. God bless you. Thank you, New Mexico.']"

You had a pretty good seat at the debate, didn't you?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President The first thing I want to say is, I hope you were proud of your fellow Californians who were the citizens on that debate. They did a good job. They asked good questions and made me feel good about it.', ""I want to thank the people who are here with us tonight. Thank you, Deputy Mayor Valerie Stallings, for your comments and for being here. Thank you, Lieutenant Governor Gray Davis. Thank you, Congressman Bob Filner, the best advocate this county ever had. If you had any idea how much time Bob Filner spends burning my ear about something for this area, you would double his pay and cut his hours. It's amazing what he does. I also want to say a special word of appreciation to Peter Navarro, who is also running for Congress, and I want you to help him get elected. Stand up, Peter. We have some other congressional candidates in the audience. I know Dan Farrell, Rita Tamerius, Darity Wesley—are they here still? Good for you.

And thank you, Kathleen Connell, for your leadership in the State controller's office."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to join me in thanking the people who provided our music. The Lincoln High School Gospel Choir, where are they? The Scripps Ranch High School Marching Band—that's how we build a crowd, you know. You bring a band and all their relatives come and their friends. It's great. And Little Feat, weren't they great? Give Little Feat a hand. [Applause] They were terrific."", ""Folks, I'm so glad to see you here tonight. I'm so glad to see so many young people here tonight. It's your future we're fighting for."", ""You know, I have had a lot of good and some very moving days in California since I have been President. I've had a lot of great days in this county since I first started coming here as a candidate. And I was thinking tonight—hoping that I would get some questions about it—but I want to say to you, the people of this county have worked with our administration, and that's why we've been able to double the border guards here, why we've been able to invest in cleaning up the environment here, why we've been able to help put more police on the street here, why we've been able to guarantee that there will be more contracts with that shipyard here, so that those folks who asked me not to forget them will have jobs into the 21st century. And I thank all of you who had anything to do with that."", ""You know, tonight you heard two very different visions of our future. And what you also heard was what I think is the last debate I'll ever be in as a candidate—unless I run for the school board some day. [Laughter] But while it was my last debate, I hope it was the beginning of a lot of conversations that all of you will have about what our country is going to be like in the 21st century. There are enormous practical consequences to the ideas that we have, to whether you really believe that we're better off on our own or whether we're better off when we work together to give each other the tools to make the most of our own lives and our families and our communities."", 'There\'s a lot of significance to whether you believe we should build a bridge to the future we can all walk across, or just show people the valley and say, ""I hope you can find some way to get over it;"" whether you believe that we\'re out there on our own because the Government is intrinsically our enemy or whether you think that the Government is just another part of this great partnership we call America. And Hillary was right: it does take a village to raise a child and build a community and build a future.', ""I want all of you to know, especially the young people that—I want you to know that, as someone who is not so young anymore, I am more idealistic today about the promise of this country than I was the day I took the oath of office as President. I have more confidence today in our ability to work together to make good things happen for America than I did the day I took the oath of office. I have more conviction today that our best days are still ahead. And I know that 20 days from now, if we decide that together we're going to build that bridge, that our best days are still ahead, and your best days are still ahead, and America will still be the greatest country in human history in the 21st century. Will you help me build that bridge? Will you help me do it for 20 more days? [Applause]"", 'Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you.']"
103,William J. Clinton ,"October 17, 1996","[""Thank you. Good morning. What a crowd! Thank you for being here. Thank you. Mayor Pulido, thank you for that wonderful welcome. Thank you for your leadership of this great city. And let me say that the mayor was a little too modest. I want to brag on him a little more. We have had a great partnership with this city. Among other things, our program to put 100,000 police on our street has brought 54 here, and the crime rate has gone down by 50 percent in Santa Ana. Thank you, Mayor, for your leadership and your work here. I'd like to thank Lieutenant Governor Gray Davis for being here. Senator Chris Dodd is here, all the way from Connecticut, the chairman of the Democratic Party. Thank you, sir, for being here. Thank you, Art Torres, our Democratic Party chair, for being here."", ""I'd like to say a special word of thanks to the mayor of Tustin, Tracy Worley, for being here. She spoke earlier. Thank you, Mayor. God bless you, and thank you so much. I'd like to thank the other congressional candidates who are here, Sally Alexander, Tina Louise Laine, Dan Farrell. I thank Stephen Weber for speaking earlier. And I want to thank the Santa Ana High School Marching Band, the Saddleback High School Road Runners. Thank you both for being here. Thank you both. Thank you."", ""I'd like to thank all the young AmeriCorps volunteers who are here for the work you're doing to make our country a better place. Thank you, Lou Correa, for your speech and for what you're doing. Give him a hand, folks. He did a good job. [Applause] And I was watching Loretta Sanchez give her speech, and I thought, boy, I'm glad she's not running against me. [Laughter] Thank you for running for Congress. Thank you for your commitment to give this congressional seat back to all the people of this congressional district. Thank you, Loretta Sanchez."", 'Ladies and gentlemen, a lot of people have asked me what I thought about the debate last night. And what I thought was that everybody in California should be very proud of those 123 citizens from San Diego and the surrounding area. They did a fine job, and they spoke for all of America, and I was very proud of them. I know you were, too.', 'When I came to Orange County in 1992, many people said, ""Why are you going there? It\'s the most Republican county in the country."" And I said, ""Because I\'m trying to change our country, and Orange County has got to be a big part of America\'s future."" I came because I was tired of the politics of blame and division and name calling that had dominated Washington for far too long, because people being put into little boxes and labeled gave everyone an excuse not to work together to solve our problems and move this country forward. I did it because I believed that you could go beyond the tired rhetoric of yesterday\'s politics, that the real issue was how you could be both good for business and good for working people, how you could both grow the economy and protect the environment. I believe that you could be a fiscal conservative and still be progressive enough to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow for all these young people in the audience. That\'s what I believed then; that\'s what I believe now.', ""And so, in 1992, I came to California and Orange County saying that I wanted to create a country in which there's opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community in which everyone has a place."", ""Do you feel that we're better off than we were 4 years ago? [Applause] You know 4 years ago, the people of California had to take me on faith, but now there is a record. There has never been a partnership between the National Government and the people of any State like the one we have forged over the last 4 years. A lot of it was born of necessity, of earthquakes and fires and floods, of the economic dislocation caused by defense cutbacks, of the terrible recession you were facing when I came here. But little by little, day by day, month by month, we worked together to meet the challenges the people of California faced. And look at the difference 4 years can make."", 'Four years ago, we had high unemployment and rising frustration. We still have a lot of challenges, but compared to 4 years ago, we have lower unemployment, 10 1/2 million new jobs, a 15-year high in homeownership, the biggest drop in childhood poverty in 20 years, the biggest drop in inequality among working Americans in 27 years, the lowest rates combined of unemployment, inflation, and home mortgage interest rates in 27 years. We are on the right track to the 21st century.', ""After inflation, the typical family's income is up over $1,600. Nearly 2 million people have moved from welfare to work. The crime rates have gone down for 4 years in a row. And we have invested more money in education and research and in environmental protection while holding Government spending to slower growth than my two Republican predecessors did. And we brought the deficit down every year for 4 years, the first time in the 20th century any administration has done that."", ""Our friends on the other side, they complain about Government all the time. They set it up as the enemy; it's Government versus the people. The last time I checked, the Constitution said, of the people, by the people, and for the people. That's what the Declaration of Independence says. That's why, even though we have abolished more regulations, ended more programs, and reduced the size of the Government more than our predecessors did, we have also done more to create opportunity, to reinforce responsibility, and to bring the American people into a community together instead of always dividing us. I am tired of that. I want us to go forward together, and I think you do, too."", ""Let me say, I was just looking at this magnificent new courthouse that's coming up up here, and I want to give special credit to one citizen of Orange County, a Republican, Roger Johnson, who worked in our administration and had a lot to do with the progress of the last 4 years. He's not here today, but I want to thank him for what he did."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, the FBI reported last week that our crime rate is at a 10-year low. In California, it's dropped to a 25-year low. We can change this country. You don't have to wonder anymore about whether what we do and you do together can make a difference to make life better. Four years ago, it was simply a matter of faith. Today you have a record."", ""Now, I'm glad we've got some of our friends in the opposition over there, and I understand why they have to try to shout us down every now and then, because for them the evidence hurts. But let's talk about the evidence and welcome them here."", 'But the question is not what have we done, but what will we do? Last night, I was so moved by the questions, because repeatedly what people wanted to know was, what are you going to do about this, that, or the other thing; how does what you do affect how I live; how does what you do, Mr. President, affect the world my children will live in.', ""And I was so impressed because the people who asked questions were not just concerned about what's going to happen next week or next month, they were also worried about what the world would be like in 20 years, in 30 years. And I tell you what I try to think about every day—and I recommend this to all of you, before you vote on November 5th, you ought to try this: Every day I ask myself, can I say in 30 seconds or a minute what my vision is for America in the 21st century? Can I say in a minute what I want my country to look like when my daughter is my age, when our children are our age? What do you want to be able to say about America and be absolutely sure it's true when we go roaring into this new century?"", 'The young people in this audience today, many of them will be doing jobs that have not been invented yet. Some of them will be doing work that has not even been imagined yet. And what we have to do is to create a world that will enable all of them to live up to the fullest of their God-given potential, a world in which all citizens take responsibility not only for themselves and their own families but for bringing us together and moving us forward.', 'As I said, I think you saw two very different visions of the future last night, two honestly different visions. We need not say bad things about our opponents to say we just have different views. We just have different views.', 'I believe the most important things in all of our lives are the personal things—that your individual life, your family life is clearly the most important thing. I believe many things have to be done at the grassroots level by people in the private sector, by religious and community organizations and civic organizations, by local government. But I believe the National Government is not your enemy; it is your servant, your partner. I believe it does take a village to raise our children and build our future.', ""And let me say to you, what does that mean in practical terms? It means I'm proud of the fact that we lowered the deficit for 4 years in a row, but I want to finish the job of balancing the budget, to keep interest rates down and the economy growing. California has not come all the way back. Not everybody who wants a good job has one. We've got to balance the budget, but we do not have to wreck Medicare or Medicaid or cut education or environmental protection or research and turn our back on our future to do it. And we should not blow a hole in it with his $550 billion tax scheme. We should keep going."", ""I believe we have to help our families. I go all over the country talking to people, and whenever I go home, I also spend a fair amount of time talking to people I grew up with. Most of them are just solid middle class citizens leading the lives that we all assumed we would lead when we were children. And everybody I talk to, when they talk about their real concerns, somehow or another it always gets around to: Can I succeed at home and at work? Can I raise a successful family and have a good career? Will I be able to do well enough financially to take care of my family, but will I have enough time with my family so that the money means something to me? I hear it everywhere in different ways. That's why I'm proud the first bill I signed was the Family and Medical Leave Act, an honest difference between my opponent and me."", 'So what are we going to do about it? First of all, we ought to have a tax cut, but it ought to be one we can afford and still balance the budget, one targeted to childrearing, to education, to buying a home, to dealing with medical costs.', ""Secondly, we ought to keep working to protect our children from the dangers of crime and guns and gangs and drugs and tobacco. We need to finish the job. We have only funded about half of those 100,000 police. The opposition believes we're making a mistake putting these police on the street. The mayor knows better. I say let's finish the job of putting 100,000 police on the street. Will you help me do that? [Applause]"", 'The second thing we ought to do—we passed the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban and this country is safer because of it. But our police officers are not as safe as they ought to be, and we ought to ban bullets whose only purpose is to pierce the bulletproof vests that police officers wear, and protect them.', ""We ought to continue to expand the safe and drug-free schools program so that in every grade school in this country there's a D.A.R.E. officer, there's somebody in a uniform telling our kids that drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you, giving them somebody to look up to. We shouldn't cut that program back for 23 million kids, as our adversaries tried to do. I say let's stay with the safe and drug-free schools program. Will you help me do that? [Applause]"", ""We ought to continue until we have finally put into effect a set of legally binding rules that will stop tobacco companies from advertising and distributing tobacco to children. Three thousand kids a day start smoking illegally; 1,000 will die sooner because of it. It is illegal. It is wrong. We should not reverse course. That's another difference between me and our friends on the other side. Will you help us prevail in that fight? Will you stick up for our future? [Applause]"", ""We ought to expand the family and medical leave law so parents can take a little time off from work without losing their jobs to take their children to regular doctors' appointments and to go to parent-teacher conferences at the schools. That's important, too, and our economy will be stronger if our parents are happier at work because they know their kids are doing better. Will you help me do that? [Applause]"", ""We passed health care reform to say you can't have your health insurance taken away just because you changed jobs or someone in your family gets sick. Twenty-five million Americans could be helped by it. We stopped insurance companies from forcing hospitals to kick mothers and newborn babies out of the hospital after just a day. They can't do that anymore."", ""But we have more to do. Our balanced budget plan will provide coverage to families when they're between jobs for up to 6 months, will add another million children to the ranks of health-insured instead of uninsured, will provide mammograms for women on Medicare, and will help families who are caring for a member with Alzheimer's. And it's all paid for in the balanced budget. Will you help me do that? [Applause]"", ""We've worked with States all over the country, without regard to party, including California, to move nearly 2 million people from welfare to work. I signed a welfare reform bill that says, we'll still guarantee to poor families health care and nutrition, but the money that the Federal Government used to send to the States for a welfare check now has to be turned into a paycheck within 2 years for able-bodied people. That's a good thing to say, but you have to have the jobs there if you're going to make people take them. I have a plan to say that this is the beginning, not the end of welfare reform. We have to create at least another million jobs in the private sector with tax incentives and other support. Will you help me do that? [Applause]"", 'We have made the air and the water cleaner. We have made our food safer. We have cleaned up more toxic waste sites in 3 years than the previous administrations did in 12. But 10 million American children still live within 4 miles of a toxic waste dump, and that is wrong. We have a plan, paid for in our balanced budget plan, to clean up the 500 worst sites in this country so that we can say, by the 21st century, the children of America—rich, poor, or middle class—are going to grow up next to parks, not poison. Will you help us do that? [Applause]', 'And finally, and most important of all, we have got to guarantee that every child in this country has access to the finest educational opportunities in the entire world. In part because we are more than ever a nation of immigrants, 40 percent of our children cannot read independently by the third grade. That means that everything they try to learn later on in life, they are handicapped in learning. It is wrong for us to permit children to leave the third grade not being able to read on their own.', 'I have a plan to mobilize 30,000 trained reading tutors, including AmeriCorps volunteers, to enlist a million volunteers across America so that we can go into the schools of America and teach our children. We did this in a rural county in Kentucky, and within a year the average child had increased their reading level by 3 years— 3 years. We can do this.', 'So I ask you, will you help me put a million people out there so that every 8-year-old can say, ""This is a book, and I can read it all by myself""? Will you help me? Will you help us to hook up every classroom and library and every school in the United States—free access to the Internet, to the World Wide Web, so that every child in America can be part of this new technology age? [Applause] And to grownups here who aren\'t as expert in computers as a lot of the kids are, let me tell you what that means. That means—if we can say that every 12-year-old in America can log on to the Internet, let me tell you what that means in practical terms. It means for the first time in the entire history of the United States, for the very first time, we can say that every child in America—rich, poor, or middle class—in every community in America, now has access to the same learning at the same level of quality at the same time. It will revolutionize education in America. Will you help me do it? [Applause]', ""And finally, we must open the doors of college education to all Americans of any age who need further education. I want to give every family the ability to save for an IRA but withdraw tax-free if the money's used to pay for college or health care or buying a first home. I want to make 2 years of education after high school just as universal as a high school diploma is today. And we can do it in only 4 years if we'll simply say we're going to let you deduct from your tax bill, dollar for dollar, the cost of a typical community college tuition. Will you help me do that? [Applause] And we should make any college cost, any college tuition tax deductible up to $10,000 a year for any Americans of any age, including older people who need to go back and get school. Will you help us do that? [Applause]"", ""Now, this election is 19 days away. And they always tell you when you're 19 days away, just come in like this, give a whoop-dee-doo speech, talk 3 minutes, leave—no more issues. But I'm telling you, the big question is 19 days is, who's going to show up. Are you going to show up? Are you going to show up? [Applause]"", 'And example, after example, after example— some of which I was able to cite last night— the people of the State of California can say, ""There is a direct consequences between the vote I cast, the person who is in charge in Washington, and the decisions made here on the streets of Santa Ana and every other city in this State that affect my life.""', ""So I ask you—I talk a lot about our responsibilities—it is your responsibility to go vote, your responsibility as a citizen, your responsibility to be there, your responsibility to build that bridge to the 21st century. In 19 days let's do it."", 'Thank you, and God bless you. Thank you.']"
104,William J. Clinton ,"October 20, 1996","['Thank you. Thank you so much, Reverend Carter, Reverend Thomas, Congressman Payne, Mr. Mayor, Mayor Collins, Congressman Torricelli.', ""Ladies and gentlemen, first of all I'd like to say, you know, about this time of year people in our line of work are tired on Sunday morning. [Laughter] They hurt from head to toe. I'm not tired anymore. [Laughter] I thank the choir for its magnificent music. And I'm glad to see all of you out here in this historic church. Dionne Warwick, it's good to see you."", ""Now, when Reverend Thomas said I lived in America's house and he made that remark about the White House—[laughter]—well, that got my attention. But I've tried to make it your house, too."", ""I want to say a special word of thanks to this church for something else, and that is that the chief operating officer of our whole national campaign is a member of this church, Ted Carter, and he's here with me today. Ted, where are you? Stand up. Where's Ted? There he is, back there. He's a very modest person that has such an important job, but you raised him up right here. Congratulations."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, the message we have already heard is the most important message we will hear today. But when he was alive, President Kennedy used to say that we must always remember that here on Earth, God's work must be our own. And there are many questions before us now in this last Presidential election of the 20th century, and the first Presidential election of the 21st century. You know them all: Will we have more jobs; will we have better education; will we continue to expand health care; will we give the little children that came to the airport to visit me today a cleaner environment to grow up in, whether they're in the inner city or in small towns?"", 'But there are two great questions in which all others can be answered. The first is whether we\'re going to keep trying to go forward to build a bridge to the future together, a bridge that everybody can walk across, or are we going to say, ""You\'re on your own, New Hope; I hope you do well. I\'ll come back and see you every now and then""? Or are we going to say, ""No, no, no, we\'re all in this together; we\'re going forward together""? We have to decide that.', 'The great British poet John Donne once said that ""No man is an island. Every man\'s death diminishes me. Never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee."" We have to ask whether we believe that. I believe that. And I believe that all of us will be better when each of us has a chance to live up to our Godgiven capacity.', ""I am glad that there are 10 1/2 million more people working than there were 4 years ago, but I'm not glad that there are so many million who still want to work who don't have jobs. And I won't rest until they do. I'm glad that there are more educational opportunities than there were 4 years ago, but I'm sad that there are still so many children who don't have what they need in their schools and for their future. And so I say to you, this will be a better country if that bridge to the future is wide enough and strong enough for everybody to walk across. Our obligation is to help each other live up to what God meant us to be. That's our obligation."", ""The second thing we have to do is to decide whether we think it is a blessing or a curse that we're all so different. That's really the meaning of the pastor's reference to the White House. [Laughter] You know, when Hillary and our daughter, Chelsea, and I went to open the Olympics in Atlanta, it was a wonderful thing. Maybe you saw it on television, where they're all walking out there and there were all these groups were going by, holding their flags, in their different uniforms. They were from 192 different nations and national groups. In our biggest county, Los Angeles County, in one county in America there are people from over 150 of those places. It used to be in America all the racial issues were black and white. Now, like everything else in life, it's hard to see black and white. That's another reason we need to show up in church, to be reminded what some things are."", ""So there we have it. Now, you look at the whole world. Pick up the paper this morning. Where are they fighting and killing each other around the world? Where are they even killing each other's children because they're of different religions, different races, different ethnic groups, different tribal groups? Is it in the Middle East, is it in Bosnia—no more, thank God—is it in Rwanda and Burundi, where tribal battles led people to slaughter each other's children and parents, or Northern Ireland, where the Catholics and the Protestants still fight over what happened 600 years ago?"", ""And people say to me, why are you so upset because a few little churches burned in the South? Because I know that deep inside every heart there is a dark spot with a capacity to define ourselves and our lives not by who we are, as children of God, but by who we are not: Who can we look down on today, who can we feel better than today. It's a big issue in this country today. And everything I have said about every issue, whether it was affirmative action or immigration or education, has been driven by my vision that this country is blessed by God to have so many people in it from different places, different races, different religions, different points of view."", 'We are living in a global society. It won\'t be very long before the children in Newark will be getting on computers and they will be able to research their papers when they\'re in high school out of libraries in Australia or Asia. The world is getting smaller. What better place to live than the greatest democracy in human history that has people from everywhere in it, when the only thing you have to do to be American is to say, ""I believe in the principles of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. I will obey the law, and I will show up tomorrow for work."" That\'s the other big question.', ""Now, whether it's me or Mr. Torricelli or Congressman Payne or the mayor or anybody else, there's a thousand different issues. But the real question is, as we look toward that tomorrow of the 21st century, whether we're all going to go there together or just let those who already have it go there, and whether we believe that we still are one nation under God, even though we're one nation of many different faiths and religions and creeds and tribes and backgrounds. And if we make those two decisions right, everything else will come out all right. We'll make all the other decisions right."", 'This preacher up here preached a message today. He doesn\'t have to tell you the answer to every question. He told you, ""You get the first question right, everything else will come out all right.""', 'God bless you. On November 5th, be there.

Well, the bishop has prayed over us so well, and my longtime friend Reverend Jones, who shares my roots in Arkansas, has spoken with such passion, and you've made Senator Levin more energetic than I ever heard him before. He's on fire. [Laughter] And Mayor Archer is on his way to becoming the world's greatest mayor. He did so well, I think I should quit while I'm ahead. He was wonderful."", ""I want to thank all the religious leaders behind me and all those in front of me. I thank Senator Levin for being here, along with the other Members of Congress who are here: Congressman Conyers, Congressman Dingell, Congressman Levin. I'm not sure if Congressman Bonior is here or not, but if he's not, you pretend like he's here. He's been working for you in Washington overtime. Our nominee for Congress, Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, thank you for being here, Carolyn. Thank you, my good friend Governor Blanchard, for being here."", 'I want to thank the people who performed before I came out, Witness and the Craig Brothers. And I want to thank the people who did that remarkable and unique job of our national anthem, Mr. Benjamin Pruitt and Sister Nancy Bradley. Thank you. If she had gone up one more ""America,"" I was going to volunteer to withdraw from the campaign and become her agent. [Laughter] It was so amazing.', ""Ladies and gentlemen, we have a wonderful array of people of faith here. We have Christians who are Catholic and Protestant; we have American Jews here; we have American Muslims here. And there is one person I think I know would be here if his health permitted him to be, Father William Cunningham, who does a brilliant job. You all know him. And I've been to a lot of places in my career in public service all across America where people are keeping hope alive and giving people a chance to make the most of their God-given abilities. But the work that Father Cunningham has done is truly unique. And he's had a pretty tough time lately, and he's doing a little better. But I'd like to ask if we could each in our own way just take a few seconds in a moment of silent prayer for Father William Cunningham and his health and God's will."", '[At this point, a moment of silence was observed.]', 'The President. Amen.', 'Audience members. Amen.', ""The President. Let me say to all of you how glad I am to be here. I thank the mayor for mentioning the opportunity I had. I thought it was an opportunity to give the Nation's highest civilian award, the Congressional Medal of Freedom, to Rosa Parks. She symbolized the empowerment that will come to every American on election day."", ""And the mayor went through the issues, and I think you know what the differences are in the choices we face. So what I want to say to all of you is that we're going into a big, different, brilliant new world. I was just with the mayor and Wayne County executive Ed McNamara out at the airport. We were breaking ground on this new $1.6 billion project that will bring you 20,000 jobs and companies from all over the world coming here to the Detroit area to invest, putting people to work. And I was thinking about that on the one hand and then, on the other, what has been done here by the businesses in this area when Detroit won in a competition, fair and square, the right to become one of our first six urban empowerment zones and then put together $2 billion worth of private commitments to invest in the city and then in a matter of a couple of years cut the unemployment rate by more than 50 percent in this city—in just a matter of a couple of years."", ""Those are the two great things I want you to focus on. One is we're going into a big new world full of new possibilities, dominated by technology, information, and the raw speed of transfer of information, ideas, money, technology, and people around the world and across national borders. The second is that if we want to make the most of those developments, we've got to do a better job of developing ourselves from the grassroots up. That's what the Detroit empowerment zone represents, making the most of the human potential. The greatest untapped economic market for America is still the Americans that aren't working up to the fullest of their capacities, learning up to the fullest of their capacities, or living up to the fullest of their capacities. And the great choice before us is whether we believe that we have an obligation to work together to make the most of this new world and to meet the challenges that remain or whether we would be better off sort of on our own or with our own little crowd."", ""I do believe it takes a village to raise a child, build a city, build a State, and build a nation. And I do believe that we have to build a bridge to the future that's big and strong enough for all of us to walk across and that all of us will do better if everybody has a chance to get on that bridge and go right on across into that new century. That's what I believe."", ""When I became President, I told you when I came here that I would give you an administration that looked like America but that I would do my best not to give any person a job for which they were not qualified. I said I'd try to do both things. And it was amazing to me that when I got to Washington some of the people wrote about this as if this was some strange and radical idea, some crazy notion."", ""But all I know is, after 4 years, we've given more women and people of color a chance to serve in the Cabinet, on the Federal bench, in high positions in the White House and other places than any previous administration—[Applause]—than any previous administration by far. And yet my nominees to the Federal court have received the highest ratings from the American Bar Association of any President since the ratings system began. You can have excellence and diversity; you can have high standards and give everybody a chance to live up to those high standards."", ""I said that I would try to find ways for everybody to participate in the bounty of America. That's what the empowerment zones were all about. That's why we're setting up community development banks all across the country to make loans to people who normally can't get loans. I've discovered—nearly a decade ago now—a man by the name of Mohammed Yunis who was educated in the United States and went home to Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries in the world, who's made loans through neighborhood banks to over a million poor village women to help them start enterprises in one of the poorest countries in the world. And he's got a higher repayment rate than the commercial banks do in the country. I figured if it was good enough for Bangladesh, it ought to be good enough for Detroit and Little Rock and every other place in the country where people ought to be given a chance to work. And they're working out there. They're working to give people a chance to tap into the free enterprise system."", ""We just put, for the first time, $5 million of our campaign funds which we have to save and invest in minority banks, four leading minority owned banks, two African-American and two Hispanic. Nobody had ever done that before. I'll bet you—I shouldn't be gambling with people of the cloth. [Laughter] Let me rephrase that. [Laughter] If I were a betting man— [laughter]—I would bet that that money will be cared for just as well and will earn just as much interest for our campaign as if we put it somewhere else. Meanwhile, it can be invested in communities where people really need the money to create jobs and go to work."", ""So—and let me just mention one or two other things. When I was confronted with the question of what to do about affirmative action, I said it may not please some of my friends, but I don't think all those programs have worked the way they're supposed to. And we're going to have to tighten the standards on some; we even got rid of one or two. But the idea that there's no more discrimination in this country and that there's no more burden that people bear, it seems to me there's no evidence to support that. And I favor not quotas, not preferences for anybody that's unqualified, but I do favor making an extra effort to give everybody a chance to prove whether they're qualified. And that's what this is about. And I might say that there is an enormous amount of opinion of people who run big business operations, many of them in the other party, who have had the same experiences I have, who have the same position I do about this. We need to be bringing the people together, not dividing."", ""One of the things I—because we have people of different faiths in this room, I want to say something else that I really have cared a great deal about. One of the great honors of my Presidency that many people didn't hear about because there wasn't enough controversy associated with it—[laughter]—was to sign a bill called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. And let me tell you what this bill did. This bill basically says that the Federal Government cannot interfere with, undermine, or weaken the practice of anybody's religion in the United States unless there is some overwhelming reason for it and the public interest cannot be protected in any other way whatsoever. In other words, the first amendment means what it says: We will not interfere with the practice of the freedom of religion. This has changed a lot of things in America."", ""For example, in a white evangelical church, a man had made his tithe payment after he'd gone bankrupt, and the Government was going to get the money back. And we said, no, no, no, we signed a law. We're not taking that money back from that church; they've got it. For example, we have respected the religious practices that are the oldest in our country, the practice of the Native Americans, our Indian people, more than ever before. We have tried to bend over backwards to respect the religious practices of Muslims wherever they live in America, even if the people involved are converts who happen to be in our penal institutions. Everywhere we have tried to work to say, the most important amendment in the Constitution is the first one: freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of assembly, and freedom of religion."", ""So all these things—I think it made a difference to America. And that brings me to the point I want to make most strongly. The mayor has gone over most of our record and there's lots of other stuff that's good, but he did as good a job as I could. I'll just leave that alone. [Laughter]"", 'There\'s a big idea here. Do you believe that we\'re better off if we go forward together with mutual respect for each other, with all of our diversity? Or are we better off having a fight every time we disagree with somebody over something instead of saying, ""If you share the values of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence, if you\'re willing to respect me even though I\'m different from you, and if you\'re willing to show up for work tomorrow and be a law-abiding citizen, that\'s all I need to know about you. You\'re part of my America. We\'re going forward together into the 21st century."" That\'s what I think our position ought to be.', ""Lest you get carried away here, this is not a simple thing. This seems self-evident to you. This is a big deal. Look at the world. Look at how the world is convulsed by the—how children, innocent children still being killed on the brink of the 21st century because of tribal, ethnic, racial, and religious differences around the world. Consider the Holy Land, the home of the three great religions of the world who all believe we are all created in the image of one God, our Creator, our Judge. How shall He judge us for keeping on killing each other into the 21st century because we're different from somebody else?"", 'Some people said they thought I had overreacted when these churches were being burned, when synagogues were being defaced with swastikas, when there was an Islamic center destroyed in South Carolina. Congressman Conyers went with me down to South Carolina to see one of these churches that had been burned and then rebuilt. And I said, no, I don\'t think so, not just because churches have been burned in my region in my lifetime and we did this before and it didn\'t work out very well, but because all over the world you see the logical conclusion of human affairs if we define ourselves primarily in terms of what we are not instead of what we are. If we start looking at other people and say, ""Thank God I\'m not them,"" then it\'s not very long before you say, ""Well, maybe God wants me to do away with them."" Is that right? [Applause] That\'s right. You think about it.', ""So in America we—there's a connection, a direct connection between this fundamental religious concept we're talking about here, whether we're all the creation of God and all equal in the eyes of God, and the much more secular event I just came from, dedicating that new airport. Why? Because this is the only great democracy that's got somebody from everywhere. This county has nearly got somebody from everywhere in it. When Hillary and Chelsea and I went to open the Olympics and there were people from 192 different groups there, national and ethnic groups around the country— our biggest county, Los Angeles County, has people from over 150 of those groups in one county. And I'll bet you're over 100 here in Wayne County."", ""So if you want to take the benefits of the modern world, you have to embrace the values in their purest form of honoring other people as equals in the eyes of God, if they behave, treat you with respect, even if they do things you think are dead wrong, if they don't break the law and they treat you with respect and they're part of our country."", ""This is very important. And that's why I have spent so much time on religious freedom, why I've spent so much time on this church burning, why after the Oklahoma City incident I tried— first of all, you remember, there were all these people who said, oh, this must be some terrorist attack from the Middle East. I said, don't jump on those people; there's no evidence of that yet. And it turned out to be a problem here at home."", ""And so I ask you all to think about that. Yes, there are these issues. Yes, I believe I'm right about family leave and our opponents are wrong—the leaders of the Congress and my opponent in the race. Yes, I think I'm right about college loans and our opponents are wrong. I believe all that. Yes, I think we were right on the empowerment zones and they were wrong to oppose us. Yes, I think we were right on trying to prove you can grow the economy and still clean up all these toxic waste sites in our cities and give our kids safety, and they were wrong to oppose it. I believe all that."", 'But you have to understand that underneath every one of those specific things there is this— these big ideas. Are we going to treat each other with respect and bring our country together and build one community and say, ""Thank you, God, for giving the United States all this diversity on the brink of the 21st century, and if we do what is morally right with this great challenge You\'ve given us""—it\'s challenging for all of us to get along. It\'s challenging for all of you in one family to get along, and challenging to get everybody in this church to get along. It\'s a challenge. So you say, ""Thank you, God, for giving us this burden."" If we can meet this challenge, there is no country better positioned for the 21st century than the United States, because it\'s going to be a global society and we\'ve got somebody from everybody here already—from everywhere.', ""So I say to you, when I talk about opening the doors of college education to all or hooking up every classroom in America to the information superhighway so that children will be talking to each other in the poorest school districts and the richest and the most middle class in America—they'll be talking to kids halfway around the world in Africa and Asia and the Middle East, in Europe, by E-mail before you know it. We'll have—for the first time in American history all of our children will have access to the same information in the same time in the same way. All those things—every one of these issues you have to think about—this is a way to let people live up to the fullest of their God-given potential and to live by our values."", ""And we have to live by our values and treat each other with respect; otherwise, we can't take advantage of all this. The two things go together. We can't build that bridge to the future unless we're going to let everybody walk over it. It won't be strong enough."", ""And there's so many things where you will be called upon to meet those challenges; I just want to mention two. One is we have to do more to help families succeed at work and at home. That's what the Family and Medical Leave Act was about. All of you will know this, but let me just put it out there anyway. The average American parent is spending more time at work and less time at home today than in 1969. People are working harder. That's why I wanted the Family and Medical Leave Act. That's why I want to expand it so people can go see their children's teacher or take their kids or their own parents to the doctor without losing their jobs—just a little expansion. I want to do that."", ""But it's also why we passed a law to say new television sets have to have this V-chip in it so a parent can determine what the children are watching when they're too young to make their own judgment, so they shouldn't be exposed to things they shouldn't see."", ""And it's why we've tried to protect our children from the dangers of tobacco being advertised to them. You know, 3,000 kids a day start smoking in this country even though it's illegal, and 1,000 will die sooner because of it. And it's illegal to do. So, yes, I plead guilty; we're trying to stop those companies from advertising, marketing, and distributing tobacco in a way that inevitably goes to kids. I think that's good. We need to finish that work."", ""It's why we have supported the safe and drugfree schools program, so there will be somebody for our 10-year-olds in a uniform standing in front of every class in the country, and people can look up to him and say, well, if they're not getting it at home, at least they ought to get it in school, somebody telling these children these drugs are wrong, they can kill you. They're not just illegal; they're wrong and they can kill you."", ""And let me just say in that regard, I want to ask you for your support about a specific thing I recommended on Saturday. We have a particularly troubling time because there's still too many of our children out there raising themselves. A lot of you know that better than I do. And I am proud, as the mayor said, that we've increased child support collections by nearly 50 percent. We're going to increase it a lot more in the next 4 years. But getting the check is not the same thing as having mama and daddy at home talking about right and wrong. It's not the same thing. It's important, but it's not the same thing."", ""Now, consider this: The crime rate has gone down in America for 4 years in a row. The violent crime rate has gone down for 4 years in a row, but the juvenile murder rate didn't start going down until last year. And the juvenile rate of violence didn't start going down until this year. Isn't that awful? Who would have ever believed that our kids under 18 could be in worse shape when it comes to violating the law than a lot of people older."", ""The drug rates in this country—the rates of casual drug use, marijuana use, and cocaine use have all gone down substantially in the last 4 years. But the rate of drug use in our country among juveniles has gone up substantially. I want to say—let me—let's get this clear: About 90 percent of our kids are still drug-free, and they're not experimenting, they're not doing anything wrong. But still, 10 or 11 percent of the people fooling around with drugs is terrifying. It's terrifying. And last weekend, I said one of the things I think we ought to do is to say to our young people, if you want to get a driver's license, we want you to pass a drug test. And if you don't pass it, you can't have a driver's license. I think that's important."", 'Now, I want to ask you—[applause]—I want to ask you to support that because some of our young people say, ""Well, what\'s that old, cranky President doing that to me for? I\'d never think of doing that."" I want you to ask the 90 percent of our kids who hadn\'t done anything wrong to take this on as a personal responsibility. They are—we are inconveniencing them to help us identify those kids that are in trouble before it is too late.', ""And I hope you will support me from the pulpit on this because this is important. We cannot afford to have a country where all the young adults—where people normally take a lot of the risks in life—are getting smarter about drugs, and the juveniles, the kids under 18, are still getting dumber about drugs. We have to do something about it. So that's one idea we have I hope you'll support."", ""The other specific thing I want to ask you for is this: I am proud of the fact that because of the strength of our economy, that we all did together, and because of special work I've done with States and communities around the country, the welfare rolls have almost 2 million fewer people on them than the day I became President—people moving from welfare to work. I'm proud of that."", 'Now, there has been a lot of controversy about this welfare reform law I signed, but I want to just ask you to think with me for about 2 minutes about that. Let me tell you what the law says. The law says the National Government will continue to guarantee to poor families and little children medical care and food and if the parent, the mother goes to work, more child care than ever. The money that used to be in the welfare check itself, which is part Federal and part State—it used to go out every month in the check—that money will now go to the States, and the States and the communities will have 2 years to figure out how to turn the welfare check into a paycheck for ablebodied people. That is a good and honorable thing to do. But we can only do it if there is a job there to earn a paycheck from.', ""So to me this is not a matter of rhetoric. I want to take poverty out of politics. I want poor people to be treated like other people. And to do that, we've got to take it out of politics. And to do that, we have to develop community- and neighborhood-based programs to treat people like individuals and families like individual families with dignity."", 'Now, let me give you an example of what can be done. And I want every one of you to think about whether your church, your synagogue, your mosque, your Islamic center could participate in this. Under the law now, it is now legal for every State in the country to say to any employer, including a religious institution, if you will add one person to your work force and you will pay them something above the minimum wage and guarantee them a job for a while, you can have their welfare check as a wage supplement.', ""In addition to that, I'm going to offer to the Congress a special targeted tax cut for people to hire people off welfare. Now, consider this. A welfare check on average in most States for a family of three is worth about—I don't know—three bucks an hour. If somebody gets hired at $7.50 an hour, $8 an hour, or whatever, the employer gets the check as a subsidy to take people and train them and care about their children and end the physical isolation that happens to people who get trapped without opportunity."", ""But don't kid yourself; this law will be a flop if the rest of us don't do our responsibility. All the people that criticized me for signing this bill, if we do a lousy job they'll be right, because poor people will be worse off after the bill than before. The problem is before, we tried it that way and half the people were always stuck. So there was a limit to how much good we could do before, and the real value of these monthly checks is much lower than it was 20 years ago."", 'Now we\'ve got a chance to take the politics out of poverty, to make it into a people problem and a challenge, and the new system will literally permit every business person in the country, every nonprofit employer in the country, every religious institution in the country to get one family and say, ""You\'re mine."" And then if the State has got any sense at all, they would do this, every State, to give the communities the power to say, here\'s the check. It\'s a supplement. We\'re going to pay you to prove that this person and her children can be just like everybody else in life if they get the right kind of help. And I ask you, I want you to help me do that. Will you think about helping me do that? Will you prove that we can give poor people another chance? Will you help us do that? [Applause]', ""The last thing I want to say is this. If you don't show up November 5th, all this is a highly academic conversation. I have worked as hard as I could to show the American people—whenever I go to a big rally—I don't know if you've ever seen them on television—I am always introduced by a citizen who has done something related to something I'm working on in Washington, because I want people like the folks that show up with you every week to see the connection between what we do in Washington—Senator Levin and I and these Members of Congress—and what you do here. That's what I want. And I'm just saying, anything you can do to increase that voter turnout, you ought to do. We talk a lot about politicians' responsibility; voting is the citizens' responsibility. That's the price you pay for democracy."", 'And I will end with this story. I was in Cleveland before I came here today—a great American city. And I drove by a church—just by total accident, it wasn\'t planned—I drove by a church that 4 years ago, about this time, I was in. And the pastor, a great American pastor—a lot of you know him—his name is Otis Moss, a great American preacher. And Otis Moss was talking to the flock that night, and he said, ""A lot of you don\'t think you ought to vote."" He said, ""Let me tell you a story."" He said, ""I grew up in the South when we weren\'t allowed to vote. And finally, after people going to jail, and people going to court, and Congress passing laws, my daddy got the right to vote. And he walked 10 miles to the polling place. And those people looked at him, and they\'d say, ‘I\'m sorry, Mr. Moss, you\'re at the wrong polling place. You got to go someplace else.\' And he said he had to walk 4 or 5 miles to the next polling place. And he said when he got there, they said, ‘I\'m sorry, Mr. Moss, the polls are closed.\' He said he\'d been waiting all his life to vote."" He said, ""The first time my daughter was old enough to vote, I took her to the polling place and we both got into the place at the same time and we closed the machines."" And he said, ""Before I could vote, I put my ear up next to my voting booth and I listened to my daughter vote, and I thought about my daddy walking all those miles all those years."" He said, ""Nobody in my family has ever missed a vote.""', ""And so I ask you to think about that bright new day that's out there before us and the many, many miles people walked without the right to have a say about that new day, and do everything you can with everybody you know to make sure that on November 5th we build that bridge to the 21st century."", 'Thank you, and God bless you.']"

I am delighted to be back here.', ""Let me say, all of you know that 4 years ago when I ran for President we had a time of high unemployment and rising frustration. And all of you know that compared to 4 years ago, we are better off. We have 10 1/2 million more jobs. The unemployment rate in Ohio has gone from 7 percent to 4.8 percent. Average family income in the last 2 years is up $1,600 after inflation, after being stagnant for a decade. We are moving in the right direction. The crime rate has come down for 4 years in a row. The welfare rolls have dropped. Child support collections are up almost 50 percent. We're moving in the right direction."", 'This election will determine what direction we take into the 21st century. That is the decision before all of you. Will you help me build a bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', ""If you compare the work we've done in the last month since you had your voices heard, compared to the last 2 years, when I vetoed a budget that would have cut education for the first time in American history, weakened environmental protection, undermined the commitments of Medicare and Medicaid—and you stood by me and made your voices heard. Now, in the last month, we raised the minimum wage for 10 million working Americans. We passed the Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform bill that says you cannot lose your health insurance anymore because somebody in your family has been sick or because you changed jobs. We gave a $5,000 tax credit to families that would adopt some of these hundreds of thousands of children out there who need a home and support of a family. And we made it easier for small-business people to take out pensions for themselves and their employees. We are moving in the right direction."", 'But now you have to make a decision in about 2 weeks. Your vote will decide whether we balance our budget and protect Medicare and Medicaid, education and the environment, and give targeted tax cuts to families to help them raise their children and educate them, to help them save for that first-time home or deal with medical costs, or whether we blow a hole in the deficit with a risky tax scheme that will raise taxes on the 9 million working people, increase the deficit, and cut education again. I think the answer is clear.', 'Your vote will decide whether we continue to support families, whether we continue to fight crime, whether we really finish the job of reforming welfare. Yes, we passed a bill that says people on welfare have 2 years to turn that welfare check into a paycheck. Now we have to make sure the jobs are there so that they can take the jobs and build good families.', 'Your vote will decide whether we continue to clean up the environment or give in to those who say we have to weaken our environment to grow our economy. You know better than that. I want to clean up 500 more toxic waste dumps in this country so every American child will be growing up next to parks, not poison, and I think you do, too.', ""Most of all, your vote will decide whether we continue our struggle for world-class education for the schoolchildren who are here, whether we continue to expand Head Start, whether we continue to raise standards, whether we hook up every single classroom in the United States of America to the information superhighway—the Internet, the World Wide Web— by the year 2000, so that for the first time in history every child in America, in a private, parochial, or a public school, whether in a rich, a middle class, or a very poor district—for the first time ever we'll have every child able to hook into the same amount of learning in the same time in the same way from all over the world. It will revolutionize opportunity for every child in the United States."", ""And above all, your vote will decide whether we make the opportunities you enjoy here available to all Americans. In the last 4 years we've had the biggest increase in Pell grant scholarships in 20 years. We had a huge increase in work-study in just the last month approved. We created the AmeriCorps program, which has helped 69,000 young people to serve their community and work their way through college. We have created the school-to-work program for young people who don't go to 4-year colleges, and that includes the Cuyahoga Community College's Tech Prep program right here. That's the kind of thing we have tried to do."", ""Now, what I want to tell you is we have more to do. One of the things we did that you heard your president talk about is pass the direct loan program. It made it quicker and cheaper for young people to get college loans. Sixteen hundred schools now participate in that program, including Cuyahoga Community College and 69 others in Ohio. And what that has meant is that 10 million Americans have saved an average of $190 each on their college loan. And even more important, it means you can borrow money to go to college without worrying about how you're going to pay it back, because you cannot be required to pay more than a certain percentage of your income every year. That means every young person in this program can afford to borrow the money to go to college. But there is more to do. I propose the following three things. It's a big part of your decision on November 5th."", ""Number one, look around you here. I want to make 2 years of education after high school as universal in America by the year 2000 as a high school diploma is today. And there's a simple way to do it. I propose to give every family a $1,500 tax credit—that's the cost of a typical community college tuition—a dollarfor-dollar reduction on their tax bill if they're going to a community college or another 2-year institution. Will you help me do that? [Applause]"", 'And I propose to give every family a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year for the cost of any college tuition, undergraduate, graduate, you name it. Will you help me do that? [Applause]', ""Finally, I propose to let families save more in IRA's and withdraw from them without any penalty if the money is being used for a college education or for health care or to buy a first home. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'Folks, even in the rain we know that the key to our future is investing in the minds of our people. This decision, more than anything else, will determine whether we together as a nation recommit ourselves to the proposition that in the 21st century if we want every American to live up to the fullest of his or her Godgiven ability, we must guarantee every American a world-class education, and I need your help to do that. Will you help? [Applause] Will you support that? [Applause]', 'The program that I have outlined altogether will make sure that the money saved by a middle class family for college need never be taxed, that we are going to invest together in a college education.', ""Now, as all of you know, my opponent has a different view. He opposed the creation of the Department of Education, and now he says that he and Speaker Gingrich will eliminate it. I believe they're wrong and we're right. We need a Department of Education. Just imagine what it would be like in the United States, alone of all the great nations, to start the 21st century with no one in the President's Cabinet to speak up for the education of our children. I say let's keep it, let's make it better, let's expand educational opportunity for all of our children."", ""Thirty-one years ago, my opponent voted against the creation of the student loan program in the first place. Three years ago, he opposed the direct lending program, which your president just praised and which you know has improved college loans right here at Cuyahoga Community College. He's tried to cut it back and cripple it ever since."", 'And the budget I vetoed last year would have cut Pell grant scholarships for hundreds of thousands of students for the first time ever. Instead, we fought them back and we got the biggest increase in Pell grants in 20 years. Will you support the direction we are taking for education for all Americans? [Applause]', ""I want you to be clear about that. Your vote is going to decide whether we continue to expand access to college and student loans or whether we eliminate the Department of Education, cut college aid, and tell our young people to fend for themselves. I don't know what all the family circumstances of all those young people in the band are over there, but I know one thing: All of us will be better off if every single one of them, without regard to their family income, can get a college education. And I want you to help me do that."", 'I want you to help me make sure we have an America in 4 years at the dawn of a new century where every 8-year-old can read, every 12-year-old can log on to the Internet, and every 18-year-old in America can go on to college. We just have 2 weeks and a day. Will you help me for 2 weeks and a day build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', 'Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you.']"
107,William J. Clinton ,"October 22, 1996","['The President. Thank you. Thank you very much. Let me, first of all, say I have had a lot of introductions in my life—[laughter]—I have had a lot of real good introductions in my life, but I have never been introduced better than Jerry Sawyer did it just then. And he was up here, you know, talking, and he got a real head of steam up, and he started talking about how the other side said my economic program would fail and they all voted against it and they said the sky would fall, and then all the good things that happened. I thought to myself when he was up here really wound up, I thought, now, where were you when I was preparing for that debate last week? I could have used you, Jerry Sawyer.', 'President Eduardo Padron, thank you for having us here at this wonderful place. Governor Chiles, thank you for your leadership for Florida and your friendship and advice to me. And the same for you, Lieutenant Governor MacKay. Congresswoman Carrie Meek was up here. She told me that she started out here at Miami-Dade Community College. And I could tell that you are still her people, and she is still yours, and you should be very proud of her—very proud of her.', ""I'd also like to thank some other folks who are up here with us today: Attorney General Bob Butterworth; our insurance commissioner, Bill Nelson; Congressman Peter Deutsch; and of course, the chairman of your board of trustees, Martin Fine. Thank you all for being here. Thank you, gentlemen, for coming. Thank you."", ""I have wanted to come here for a long time to the largest community college in the entire United States of America. I am grateful to you for many things. But some of you may not know it—I actually have a member of my Cabinet who went to school here, whose parents taught here, and whose mother, I believe, is still in the audience. Carol Browner went here and then on to the University of Florida and wound up being head of the Environmental Protection Agency, where she is helping us to save the Florida Everglades. Thank you, Miami-Dade. And I'd like to thank her mother if she's here in the audience."", 'Ladies and gentlemen, this is college day for us. The First Lady is at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. The Vice President is at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. I got to come here to America\'s largest community college because I believe that community colleges work the way America has to work in the 21st century. If you just think about it, this is not a bureaucratic organization; it\'s a flexible, creative organization. You change from year to year the programs you offer. And you have to meet a high standard of excellence; otherwise you\'ll be punished for what you don\'t know in the marketplace. It is a purely democratic organization—that\'s small ""d"" democratic—in the sense that it\'s open to all. Nobody asks you what your race, your religion, your ethnic background is. All you\'ve got to do is be willing to work hard, learn what you\'re supposed to learn, take the exams, make the most of your own lives. If you show up, you\'re a part of the community college, and you ought to be a part of the American community as well. This is the way America ought to work, the way these community colleges work.', ""Today I came here to talk about expanding opportunity to colleges. But I want to say something about what Jerry mentioned. Today we got some more evidence that America's economy is on the right track with low unemployment, low inflation, and low mortgage rates. We now have 4 1/2 million new homeowners in the last 4 years, and lower interest rates have helped 10 million more Americans to refinance their old mortgages at lower rates, saving huge amounts of money for those families. Homeownership is an idea that ought to be available to every working American. We now have the highest rate in 15 years. And by the 21st century, if you'll give us 4 more, Secretary Cisneros and the rest of us who are working on this will have an all-time high of homeownership. By the year 2000, more than two-thirds of the American people will be living in their own homes if you will work with us and help us to build that bridge to the future."", 'My fellow Americans, you\'ve got a big decision to make on November 5th. Are we going to build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past? Are we going to build a bridge wide enough and strong enough for everybody to walk across together, or will we say, ""There\'s the future out there. I hope you can make it""?', 'Audience members. No-o-o!', 'The President. Are we going to tell the American people, ""You\'re on your own,"" or are we going to say that, yes, it does take a village to raise and educate our children and build our country and go forward together? [Applause]', ""You heard Jerry say it, and you know we're in better shape than we were 4 years ago: 10 1/2 million more jobs, the deficit cut by 60 percent, nearly 2 million fewer people on welfare, the lowest violent crime rate in 10 years. We are moving in the right direction. But your vote will decide what bridge we take to the future and whether we build one wide enough for everyone to walk across."", ""I want to ask every one of you who's here tonight—this afternoon, this beautiful Florida afternoon, to do something tonight when you go home. I want you to do this, not for me but for you. Just take a few minutes and see if you can say to yourself the answer to this question: What do I want my country to be like when we start that new century? What do I want my country to be like when my children are my age, when my grandchildren are my age? What is my dream for America?"", ""For 4 years I've been working on that dream for America, mine. It's simple and straightforward. I want the American dream alive and well for every single person who is responsible enough to work for it. I think everybody should have the chance to live out their dreams and to live up to their God-given capacities. I want this country to be the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity. And I want us to go forward together, where families can succeed at home and at work, where we're living in harmony with our environment, and most important, where we're living in harmony with each other. That is my vision."", 'And so I have worked to create more opportunity for all, to reinforce the principles of responsibility from all, and to create an American community where every person, without regard to race, color, creed, gender, you name it, believe they have a place at the American table and in the American future. That is what I have worked for.', 'But now you will decide. You will decide by how you vote. You will decide by whether you vote. You have to decide. You will decide whether we balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education, the environment, and research; whether we have targeted tax cuts to help people educate their children and themselves, raise their kids, buy a home, deal with medical costs; or whether we adopt that big, risky tax scheme that would blow a big hole in the deficit, weaken our economy, and force even bigger cuts in education, in the environment, in Medicare and Medicaid than those I vetoed a year ago. You will decide.', ""You will decide by how you vote. You will decide by whether you vote. You will decide whether we can help more people to succeed at home and at work. Twelve million families have taken a little time off from work without being fired when a baby was born or a parent was sick. It's helped the American economy, and I want to keep it and do more. I want to say that parents ought to get a little time off to go to those regular conferences with their children's teachers or to take a family member to the doctor, to a regular appointment. You will decide whether we do it and whether we build that bridge."", 'We have started to protect our children from the dangers of guns and gangs and drugs and tobacco. Over the intense partisan opposition, we passed the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban. We extended the Brady bill to say if you beat up your spouse or your child you should not be able to buy a handgun; you\'re a danger to society. We said to the tobacco companies, ""You may sell your products to adults, but it\'s illegal for children to smoke, so stop marketing, advertising, and delivering cigarettes to our children.""', 'We passed tough new laws against drug dealers, including the death penalty for drug kingpins. We dramatically increased funds to help our schools keep our kids out of trouble in the first place with safe and drug-free schools programs. We said to the States, ""We want you to start drug testing parolees."" If people want to be out on the streets, they ought to stay off of drugs. If they\'re going to get back in trouble, they ought to lose their rights to walk the streets. Don\'t get any more kids in trouble. Your vote will decide whether we finish this work with tobacco and drugs and guns and gangs or whether we walk back on it.', ""We passed the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, which says to 25 million Americans we can't take your health insurance away from you anymore just because you changed jobs or somebody in your family's been sick. We stopped— we passed a law that said insurance companies cannot force hospitals to kick new mothers and their newborn babies out of the hospital after one day anymore. But your vote will decide whether we keep on doing that, whether we provide health insurance to another million children, whether we help families who lose their jobs keep their health insurance when they're between jobs, whether we continue to work with States like Florida to help offer affordable health insurance to working people with limited incomes. Your vote will decide, and whether you vote will decide."", 'We passed a historic welfare reform bill. And I want to applaud Governor Chiles on being one of the first three States in the country to submit a plan to actually move people from welfare to work, not to abandon poor families and poor children. Thank you, Governor.', ""Now, we moved 2 million people from welfare to work. The new law says every State and every community has 2 years for every able-bodied family to turn that welfare check into a paycheck. Meanwhile, we'll guarantee health care; we'll guarantee food on the table; we'll spend more for child care if you go to work. But if you can work, within 2 years, you've got to turn the paycheck—the welfare check into a paycheck. That sounds good. But to do it, there has to be a paycheck. I've got a plan to create a million more jobs for people on welfare in partnership with the private sector. Your vote will decide whether we walk away from those people or create those jobs so they, too, can be part of the American dream."", ""We have made our streets safer with 100,000 more police on the books but not all on the streets. We've only funded about half of them. And our friends on the other side—just as Jerry said with the budget—they fought us every step of the way with the crime bill. But we have saved that, and that's why the crime rate's gone down for 4 years in a row."", ""But it's still not safe enough on Florida's streets. And we don't want to just catch criminals, we also want to prevent crime in the first place. That means you need people out there working with the kids, being strong role models, and preventing things from happening in the neighborhoods and on the streets. You need to help us finish the job of putting the rest of those police officers on the street. And your vote will decide whether we do that or go back. It is up to you. Will you help us do that? [Applause]"", 'We have taken more chemical pollutants out of the air. We have made our drinking water safer. We have raised the standards for food. We have done more to protect national parks and to expand national parks. We have begun the work, but not finished the work, of protecting the Everglades. You will decide. You will decide whether we will keep up this work and finish the job on the Everglades. You will decide whether we will clean up 500 more toxic waste dumps because there are still 10 million American children growing up within 4 miles of a toxic waste site. That is wrong. I want them growing up next to parks, not poison. You will decide. Will you help us do that? [Applause]', 'But most important of all, you will decide whether we build an America in which we have a world-class education system open to all Americans. I have worked hard, from expanding opportunities for Head Start, to giving our schools more tools for the kids to meet higher standards, to creating the national service program, AmeriCorps—some of the people are here—that have allowed people to work in their communities and earn their way to college, to the biggest increase in Pell grants in 20 years, to the direct student loan program.', ""And thank you, President Padron and others, for supporting that. We are saving the average college student on the direct loan program about $200 a year. But more important, we're saying to every student who borrows money in that way, you don't have to worry about your college loans anymore because you can pay it back as a percentage of your income. No one can ever make you go bankrupt because you borrowed the money to go to college. That is a good thing."", 'Every step along the way, we had to fight our opponents on the other side. They tried to kill the student loan program improvements. They tried to cut back on Head Start. They tried to kill the national service program. Now they even have promised to eliminate the Department of Education.', 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. Your vote will decide, and whether you vote will decide. That's their program: go into the 21st century with not a single soul in the President's Cabinet speaking for the education of our children. Is that the future you want?"", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', 'The President. Well, you have another alternative. Jerry talked about it, but I want to say again, I want to emphasize four things to you that I want to do in education, all important to Florida.', 'Number one, 40 percent of the 8-year-olds in America cannot read a book on their own today. Part of that is because we\'re a nation of immigrants, we have a lot of young kids whose first language is not English. But everyone needs to be able to read in order to keep learning. I want to mobilize 30,000 people, the AmeriCorps volunteers, trained reading tutors, and others, to get a million volunteers across America to go into the schools, to work with the parents so that in 4 years we can say every 8-year-old in America can pick up a book and say, ""I can read this all by myself.""', ""I was in Tampa the other day at a school which was so crowded they had folks meeting in trailers next to the school, a beautiful old school. We have the largest number of schoolchildren in America today ever in history, almost 52 million. The United States Government has never helped schools with their building problems. But children cannot learn if they're in impossible, rundown, beat-up, substandard conditions without adequate equipment. So I have a program to lower the interest rates and therefore cut the costs to the taxpayers in the school districts of building those facilities or repairing them. If local people are willing to make an extra effort to help their schools, the Federal Government should be a partner and lower the cost of doing it. And I want you to help me do that."", ""The third thing I want to do—now, when Jerry said this, all the young people clapped, and I couldn't tell whether those of us who are older were or not. Let me tell you what it means to hook up every classroom and every library to the information superhighway by the year 2000. It means for the first time in the history of America, children in the poorest school districts, children in the richest school districts, and children in all the school districts in between for the very first time will all have access to the same information in the same way at the same time. Will you help me do that? [Applause]"", ""Folks, this is a big deal. We can't turn our backs on learning. Learning is generating more jobs for us. More than half of these new jobs are high-wage jobs. That's the good news. The challenging news is if you want them, you have to know something and you have to be able to keep learning."", 'Just in the last 4 years, learning has done the following things: We have more than doubled the life expectancy for people with HIV. We have discovered two genes that cause breast cancer, giving us hope that we can not only cure it earlier but actually someday prevent it. In the last 4 years, we have developed the first real treatment for people who have strokes— never any real medical treatment before. These are things that are happening.', 'A lot of you heard Christopher Reeve talk at the Democratic Convention, and he talked about medical research, sitting there so bravely in his wheelchair. About the time he spoke, for the first time ever, a laboratory animal with its spine completely severed had movement in its lower limbs because of a nerve transfer to the spine from another part of the body. Learning is the answer to so many of our problems and the key to our future and to our prosperity and to our quality of life.', ""We are working to build a supercomputer with IBM that will do more calculations in one second than you can do on your own calculator in 30,000 years. That's how much learning is going forward."", ""So I say to you, the last thing we have to do is open the doors of college education to every American of every age at any time who needs to go. And I want you to help me do it. I want you to be able to save in an IRA and withdraw from that IRA without any tax penalty at all if you use the money on a college education. I want you to be able to do just what Jerry says: I want every community college student in America to know that we have to make at least 2 years of education after high school as universal by the year 2000 as a high school education is today, and we're going to do it by letting you just take off your tax bill dollar for dollar the cost of a tuition at any community college in the country. That's what I want you to do. And I want you to help us do it. And finally, for people that go on to college, I think you ought to be able to deduct up to $10,000 a year for the cost of any college tuition, anywhere, at any level. And I want you to help me do that."", 'Now, I say again, your vote will decide, and whether you vote will decide. This is not a small election. The world is changing too much. The best days of this country are ahead. You will have more opportunity than any generation of Americans before if you make the right decision. But you have to decide.', 'And the last thing I leave you with is this: We will never be what we ought to be unless we prove that our diversity is a great asset, not a liability, unless we reject the religious, the racial, the tribal, the ethnic hatreds that are consuming people all around the world. Pick up the newspaper any day and you can see it. In America, that is not for us. We stand for freedom. We stand for equal opportunity. We stand for the responsibility of every citizen and the right of every citizen to be treated equally under the law. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause] Will you be there on November 5th? [Applause] I need you.', 'Thank you. God bless you. Thank you.']"
108,William J. Clinton ,"October 22, 1996","[""Thank you very, very much. Thank you so much. Mayor and Mrs. Archer, Congressman Dingell, Congressman Bonior, Congressman Levin, Governor and Mrs. Blanchard, Mayor Stanley—[applause]—you can clap for anyone you like, it's an informal day—Mayor Stanley, Bishop, Mayor Bob Kozaren of Hamtramck, welcome. [Applause] Thank you."", ""I'd like to welcome the fourth-grade students from the Hiller Elementary School from Lapeer, Michigan. They're here somewhere. Where are they? Welcome. We're glad you're here. And students from the Academy of Military Science in Detroit are here somewhere, I think. Where are you, back there in the back? Welcome."", ""I want to thank Senator Carl Levin for his extraordinary work. As you know—I'm sure everyone in Michigan knows that in January Senator Levin will become at least the ranking Democratic member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and perhaps the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. We wish him well. In addition to his vigorous representation of the people of Michigan on all kinds of domestic issues, he has been a great leader for keeping our Nation strong and secure in this time of remarkable change. And the State, the Nation, and the President are in your debt, Senator. Thank you very much."", ""I am delighted to be here in Detroit to discuss the challenges we face as we enter the 21st century, to make sure that we remain the world's strongest force for peace and freedom, for security and prosperity. Detroit is a city meeting the challenges of the future and is the perfect place for me to have this opportunity to visit with you. Yesterday I couldn't help thinking that in the empowerment zone that the mayor and others have worked to make so much of, which has generated $2 billion in private capital to develop the resources of the people of Detroit here, and in the ground we broke yesterday for a $1.6 billion new airport to give you the capacity to reach out to the rest of the world, Detroit is doing what all of America must do. We must develop ourselves and reach out to the rest of the world. Congratulations, Mayor, and to all the other local officials here. We're delighted to be here."", 'From its very founding, our Nation has stood for the idea that people have the right to control their own lives, to pursue their own dreams. In this century we have done far more than just stand for these principles; Americans have acted upon them and sacrificed for them, fought two World Wars so that freedom could triumph over tyranny, then made commitments that kept the peace, that helped to spread democracy, that brought great prosperity to ourselves and helped to win the cold war.', 'Now the ideas we struggle for, democracy and freedom—freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, open markets, respect for diversity—these ideas are more and more the ideals of humanity. When we adopted democracy as our form of government in 1776, and then when we ratified our Constitution a few years later, it was an unusual choice that we made. Democracy had largely vanished from the Earth for nearly 2,000 years, since ancient Greece.', ""In this century, amid all the wars and bloodshed, we have struggled to advance the cause of democracy and to support those who are seeking it. And now, for the first time in history, 61 percent of the world's nations, and for the very first time in the last couple of years, over half of the people on the face of the globe live under democratically elected leaders in free countries. That's a remarkable thing. This never happened before."", ""Four years ago when I sought the Presidency I said that to build a strong community based on opportunity and responsibility here at home, to be both prosperous and secure, we would have to continue to lead abroad in this new era. The burden of American leadership and the importance of it, indeed, the essential character of American leadership is one of the great lessons of the 20th century. It will be an even more powerful reality in the 21st century, a century in which the blocs and barriers that defined the world for previous generations will continue to give way to greater freedom, faster change, greater communications and commerce across national borders, and more profound innovation than ever before, a century in which more people than ever will have the chance to share in humanity's genius for progress."", ""As walls come down around the world, so must the walls in our minds between our domestic policy and our foreign policy. Think about it. Our prosperity as individuals, communities, and a nation depends upon our economic policies at home and abroad, on Detroit's empowerment zone and your commitment to an airport facility that will connect you better to the rest of the world. Our well-being as individuals, communities, and a nation depends upon our environmental policies at home and abroad. Our security as individuals, communities, and a nation depends upon our policies to fight terrorism, crime, and drugs at home and abroad. We reduce the threats to people here in America by reducing the threats beyond our borders. We advance our interests at home by advancing the common good around the world."", ""Let me just give you one example that I'll return to in a moment. In the last 4 years the American people, working together, have created 10 1/2 million new jobs. Now, that is good news. But perhaps even more important, more than half of those jobs are in high-wage categories. That is one reason that real wages for the typical working family have started to rise again for the first time in a decade."", ""Now, that has to be seen in terms of what is happening to the American economy becoming connected to the rest of the world. We've had an all-time high in exports, an increase in exports of about 35 percent, and we know that export-related jobs, on average, pay considerably higher than jobs which are totally confined in their economic impact to the domestic community."", ""The 200-plus agreements we've made in trade, including over 20 with Japan, we've seen an increase of 85 percent in the export of American products to Japan. I visited, as many of you know, an American auto dealership in Tokyo. And just yesterday we learned that our exports of American cars to Japan increased 40 percent in just one year last year. I say that simply to make the point that our economic policies at home and abroad affect the wellbeing of America's families."", 'And in a world that is increasingly interconnected, we have to just sort of take down that artificial wall in our mind that this is completely a foreign policy issue and this is completely a domestic issue, because increasingly they impact one on the other. That is why I think, among other things, we have to resist those who believe that now that the cold war is over the United States can completely return to focusing on problems within our borders and basically ignore those beyond our borders.', ""That escapism is not available to us because at the end of the cold war, America truly is the world's indispensable nation. There are times when only America can make the difference between war and peace, between freedom and repression, between hope and fear. We cannot and should not try to be the world's policeman. But where our interests and values are clearly at stake, and where we can make a difference, we must act and lead."", 'We must lead in two ways: first, by meeting the immediate challenges to our interests from rogue regimes, from sudden explosions of ethnic, racial, and religious and tribal hatreds, from short-term crises; and second, by making longterm investments in security, prosperity, peace, and freedom that can prevent these problems from arising in the first place and that will help all of us to fully seize the opportunities of the 21st century.', 'We have approached the immediate challenges with strength and flexibility, working with others when we can, alone when we must, using diplomacy where possible and force where necessary.', ""When I took office, the bloodiest war in Europe since World War II was raging in Bosnia. Thanks to U.S.-led NATO air strikes, American diplomacy, and IFOR's peacekeeping efforts, the war is over. Elections have been held. The Bosnian people are now getting on with the very hard work of rebuilding their lives, their land, their economy, and their capacity to deal with each other in an atmosphere of respect. None of it will be easier, but America acted, our partners and allies acted. And think of what would have happened if we had walked away."", ""When I took office, dictators terrorized Haiti. They forced tens of thousands of refugees to flee. Because we backed American diplomacy with military force and the power of an international coalition, the dictators are gone; Haiti's democracy is back; the flight from fear has ended. Difficulties remain, but think what it would be like if America had not acted."", 'As Senator Levin said, when I took office North Korea was moving forward with a dangerous nuclear program it had been working on for more than a decade. Thanks to our diplomacy, and with the help of Japan, South Korea, and China, North Korea has frozen that program under international monitoring. I wish that more progress were being made in North Korea toward openness, but think how much worse it would be if we had not acted.', 'Two years ago the collapse of the Mexican peso jeopardized our own economy and the sanctity of our borders. Because we stepped in immediately and rallied others to join us, Mexico has rebounded. Three-quarters of our loans have been repaid ahead of schedule. We are earning interest on the deal. I believe we have made about a half a billion dollars so far. I know that was one of the more unpopular decisions of my Presidency, but think what would have happened if we had allowed our neighbor to the south to collapse economically without a supporting hand from the United States for their efforts to reform their political and economic systems and, therefore, to be able to work with us in a supportive way.', ""In each of these cases we were able to succeed because, first, we accepted the responsibility to lead. But it isn't enough just to handle these immediate crises. We also must set our sights on a more distant horizon. Through our size, our strength, our relative wealth, and also through the power of our example, America has a unique ability to shape a world of greater security and prosperity, peace, and freedom. These are long-term efforts and often they take place behind the headlines. But only by pursuing them can we give our children the best possible opportunity to realize their own Godgiven potential."", ""That's why we have worked patiently and pragmatically to reduce the threat of weapons of mass destruction, to take on the challenge of terrorism, to build an open trading system for the 21st century, to help secure the gains that peace and freedom are making around the world. We are making the future more secure by lifting the danger of weapons of mass destruction."", 'It has taken hard negotiations and persistent diplomacy. But consider the results. Today, not a single Russian missile targets America. We are cutting our nuclear arsenals by two-thirds. We are working to keep the remaining weapons safe and secure. We helped to convince Ukraine, Kazakstan, and Belarus to give up the warheads left on their lands after the Soviet Union dissolved. We won the indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, our most powerful tool in keeping nuclear weapons from spreading. And just a few weeks ago, after literally decades of discussion that began under Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy, I was proud to be the first head of state to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Once enforced, it will end nuclear testing for all times.', 'There is, to be sure, more hard work ahead of us. We must secure the ratification in the United States Senate of the Chemical Weapons Convention, to make it more difficult for rogue states and terrorists to acquire poison gas. We must strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention to help prevent the use of disease as a weapon of war. And we must succeed in negotiating a worldwide ban on antipersonnel landmines, which murder and maim more than 25,000 people a year.', 'As we keep our focus on these goals, we must also keep the heat on terrorists who would darken the dawn of the new century. Piece by piece, we have put in place a strategy to fight terrorism on three fronts: toughening our laws at home, tightening security in our airports and airplanes, and pressing our allies to adopt with us a strict policy of zero—zero—tolerance for terrorism.', ""In the congressional session just concluded, two important pieces of legislation were passed to help give us the tools to fight terrorists at home. And almost all the Vice President's recommendations for increased security at our airports and on our airplanes were adopted in a billion-dollar bill designed to help us move immediately and aggressively to improve airport and airline security. I am encouraged by that."", 'When I met last summer with the leaders of the G-7 nations in France, they agreed to work with us to try to get a zero tolerance for terrorism policy around the world. While we can defeat terrorists—and we have been successful in thwarting attempted terrorist attacks in the United States, attempted attacks on our planes flying out of the West Coast; recently there was a conviction in a United States court of a person we extradited back to the United States who was charged and then convicted of conspiring to blow up a number of airplanes flying out of our West Coast over the Pacific— it will be a long time before we defeat terrorism. But we have to remain determined and strong. If we do, we know we can prevail.', 'It took a while for the cold war to be resolved in a way that was favorable to humanity and freedom, but we stayed the course, and we must stay the course against this. And our allies must help us. We simply cannot be doing business by day with people who are supporting terrorists who will kill us by night. That is wrong, and we must work to develop a common policy on that.', ""We are building prosperity at home by opening markets abroad, as I said earlier. I believe that decades from now people will look back on this period and see the most far-reaching changes in the world trading system in generations. More than 200 trade agreements we have negotiated have led to more than a million new jobs. They've helped to make America the number one exporter again. You know that here in Detroit. You led the Nation here with the fastest recent growth in export trade. And today, for the first time since the 1970's, the United States is again the number one producer of automobiles in the world."", ""It is not easy to both expand trade and keep the rules fair. It has to be done issue by issue, agreement by agreement. It is hard work, dayin and day-out, month-in and month-out, yearin and year-out. But we must continue to do it. Next month I will travel again to Asia, to the Philippines, for the fourth annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, because a lot of America's future is tied to Asia's future. As a Pacific power, we have a responsibility to work for stability and security in Asia, and an opportunity to benefit from that region's extraordinary economic growth."", ""We are also working to advance the cause of peace and freedom around the world. This also is a mission rooted in both our ideals and our interests. After all, when people live free and they're at peace, they're much less likely to make war or abuse the rights of their own citizens, much more likely to be good trading partners and partners in the struggle against terrorism, international crime, and drug trafficking, working with us to prevent global environmental decay. From the Middle East to Northern Ireland, from Cuba to Burma, from Burundi to South Africa, those taking risks for peace and freedom know that the United States will stand at their side."", 'Nowhere are our interests more engaged than in Europe. When Europe is at peace, our security is strengthened. When Europe prospers, so does America. We have a special bond because our Nation was formed from the hopes and dreams of those who came to our shores from across the Atlantic seeking religious freedom, fleeing persecution, looking for a better life. From the Pilgrims of 1620 to the Hungarian freedom fighters of 1956, whose struggle we commemorate tomorrow, they gave America the strength of diversity and the passion for freedom.', ""Remarkable generations of Americans invested in Europe's peace and freedom with their own sacrifice. They fought two World Wars. They had the vision to create NATO and the Marshall plan. The vigor of those institutions, the force of democracy, the determination of people to be free, all these helped to produce victory in the cold war. But now that that freedom has been won, it is this generation's responsibility to ensure that it will not be lost again, not ever."", 'President Reagan gave strength to those working to bring down the Iron Curtain. President Bush helped to reunify Germany. And now, for the very first time since nation-states first appeared in Europe, we have an opportunity to build a peaceful, undivided, and democratic continent. It has never happened before; it can be done now, a continent where democracy and free markets know no boundaries, but where nations can be assured that their borders will always be secure and their sovereignty and independence will always be respected.', 'In January 1994, during my first trip to Europe as President, I laid out a strategy for European integration: political integration around democracies, economic integration around free markets, security integration around military cooperation. I urged our enduring allies and new friends to build the bonds among our nations that are necessary for this time, through the European Union, through NATO, through the other institutions of a new Europe. I challenged all our people to summon the will and the resources to make this vision real.', ""The United States and Europe are answering that challenge. With our help, the forces of reform in Europe's newly free nations have laid the foundations of democracy. They have political parties and free elections, an independent media, civilian control of the military. We've helped them to develop successful market economies and now are moving from aid to trade and investment."", ""Look at what has been achieved by our common efforts. In the 7 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, two-thirds of Russia's economy has moved from the heavy grip of the state into private hands. Poland has now one of the West's highest rates of growth. You're as likely to read about Poland on the business page as the front page today. The private sector produces half the national income of an independent Ukraine. From the Czech Republic to Hungary to Estonia, the same forces of freedom and free markets are creating bustling prosperity and hope for the future."", ""The bedrock of our common security remains NATO. When President Truman signed the North Atlantic Treaty 47 years ago, he expressed the goal of its founders plainly but powerfully: to preserve their present peaceful situation and to protect it in the future. All of us here today, every single one of us, are the beneficiaries of NATO's extraordinary success in doing just that."", 'NATO defended the West by deterring aggression. Even more, through NATO, Western Europe became a source of stability instead of hostility. France and Germany moved from conflict to cooperation. Democracy took permanent root in countries where fascism once ruled.', ""I came to office convinced that NATO can do for Europe's East what it did for Europe's West: prevent a return to local rivalries, strengthen democracy against future threats, and create the conditions for prosperity to flourish. That's why the United States has taken the lead in a three-part effort to build a new NATO for a new era: first, by adapting NATO with new capabilities for new missions; second, by opening its doors to Europe's emerging democracies; third, by building a strong and cooperative relationship between NATO and Russia."", ""To adapt NATO, we have taken on missions beyond the territory of its members for the first time and done so in cooperation with nonmember states, shifting our emphasis to smaller and more flexible forces prepared to provide for our defense but also trained and equipped for peacekeeping. We're setting up mobile headquarters to run these new missions more effectively and efficiently. We're giving our European allies a larger role within the alliance, while preserving NATO's vital core, which is an integrated command military structure."", ""The United States will continue to take the lead in NATO, especially in the southern region where the most immediate threats to peace exist. But we welcome our allies' willingness to shoulder a greater share of the burden and to assume greater leadership."", 'Bosnia has been the first major test of the new NATO. At first, NATO could act jointly only with the United Nations. But once NATO took charge, once its lead, its air power, together with its diplomatic leadership, was available fully, it pushed the Bosnian Serbs from the battlefield to the bargaining table. The NATO-led Implementation Force has restored security to Bosnia. It has given the Bosnian people a chance—not a guarantee but a chance—to build a lasting peace.', 'But for NATO to fulfill its real promise of peace and democracy in Europe, it will not be enough simply to take on new missions as the need arises. NATO must also take in new members, including those from among its former adversaries. It must reach out to all the new democracies in Central Europe, the Baltics, and the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union.', 'At the first NATO summit I attended in January of 1994, I proposed that NATO should enlarge steadily, deliberately, openly. And our allies agreed. First, together, we created the Partnership For Peace as a path to full NATO membership for some and a strong and lasting link to the alliance for all. I think it would be fair to say that the Partnership For Peace has exceeded what even its most optimistic supporters predicted for it in the beginning. There are more than two dozen members now.', ""The more than two dozen members and the astonishing amount of cooperation and joint training and partnership that has developed as a result of this Partnership For Peace has made it something of significance—I believe enduring significance—beyond what we ever imagined when we started it. And the strategy is paying off. The prospect of membership in or partnership with NATO has given Europe's new democracies a strong incentive to continue to reform and to improve relations with their neighbors."", 'Through the Partnership For Peace, prospective new members are actually gaining the practical experience they need to join NATO. Thirteen partner nations are serving alongside NATO troops and helping to secure the peace in Bosnia. There are Polish and Czech combat battalions, Hungarian and Romanian engineering troops, soldiers from Ukraine and the Baltic States, forces from Sweden and Finland, and a full Russian brigade. Just 7 years ago, these soldiers served on opposite sides of the Iron Curtain. Today, their teamwork with our troops and other European NATO allies is erasing the lines that once divided Europe while bringing an end to the bloodiest conflict in Europe since World War II.', ""We have kept NATO enlargement on track. Now it is time to take the next historic step forward. Last month, I called for a summit in the spring or early summer of next year to name the first group of future NATO members and to invite them to begin accession talks. Today I want to state America's goal. By 1999, NATO's 50th anniversary and 10 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the first group of countries we invite to join should be full-fledged members of NATO."", ""I also pledged for my part, and I believe for NATO's part as well, that NATO's doors will not close behind its first new members. NATO should remain open to all of Europe's emerging democracies who are ready to shoulder the responsibilities of membership. No nation will be automatically excluded. No country outside NATO will have a veto. We will work to deepen our cooperation, meanwhile, with all the nations in the Partnership For Peace. A gray zone of insecurity must not reemerge in Europe."", 'Now, I want to say that as we go forward the American people should be aware that this plan is not free of costs. Peace and security are not available on the cheap. Enlargement will mean extending the most solemn security guarantee to our new allies. To be a NATO member means that all the other members make a commitment to treat an attack on one as an attack on all. But mark my words, if we fail to seize this historic opportunity to build a new NATO in a new Europe, if we allow the Iron Curtain to be replaced by a veil of indifference, we will pay a much higher price later on down the road. America will be stronger and safer if the democratic family continues to grow, if we bring to our ranks partners willing to share the risks and responsibilities of freedom.', ""By overwhelming majorities this summer, both Houses of Congress passed a NATO enlargement facilitation act. I greatly appreciate this bipartisan support for our efforts to forge a broader alliance of prosperity, of security and, as the First Lady said in Prague on the last 4th of July, an alliance of values with Europe. I look forward to working with Congress to ratify the accession of new members, to provide the resources we need to meet this commitment, to secure the support of the American people. NATO enlargement is not directed against anyone. It will advance the security of everyone: NATO's old members, new members, and nonmembers alike."", 'I know that some in Russia still look at NATO through a cold-war prism and, therefore, look at our proposals to expand it in a negative light. But I ask them to look again. We are building a new NATO, just as we support the Russian people in building a new Russia. By reducing rivalry and fear, by strengthening peace and cooperation, NATO will promote greater stability in Europe and Russia will be among the beneficiaries. Indeed, Russia has the best chance in history to help to build that peaceful and undivided Europe and to be an equal and respected and successful partner in that sort of future.', 'The great opportunity the Russian people have is to define themselves in terms of the future, not the past, to forge a new relationship with NATO as enlargement moves forward. The United States has suggested that Russia and NATO work out a formal agreement on cooperation. We should set up a regular mechanism for NATO-Russia meetings at all levels. We should consult on European security issues so that whenever possible NATO and Russia can act jointly to meet the challenges of the new era, just as we have acted jointly in Bosnia.', 'Just think about it. In Bosnia, Russia and NATO are already partners for peace. We should set our sights on becoming full partners and bringing all of Europe together. Together we can help to turn the main battleground for the bloodiest century in history into a continent whose people remain secure and prosperous, free and at peace.', ""These past 4 years it's been one of the greatest privileges of my life to represent America around the world, from the halls of Kremlin to the hillsides of Port-au-Prince, from the deserts of Jordan to the Tokyo Harbor, from the Charles Bridge in Prague and Riga's Freedom Square to the DMZ in Korea. I have heard the voices and shaken the hands of presidents and prime ministers and, just as important, citizens on the streets of distant lands. Wherever I go, whomever I talk with, the message to me is the same: We believe in America. We trust America. We want America to lead. And America must lead."", 'I wish every American could see our country as much of the world sees us. Our friends rely upon our engagement. Our adversaries respect our strength. When our family went to open the Olympics in Atlanta, I was so moved by the statements of young people from around the world about the efforts the United States had made to foster peace in Bosnia, peace in Northern Ireland, peace in the Middle East, things these young athletes felt personally because it was their lives, their future, and the children they still hope to have on the line.', ""As we enter the 21st century, we must make a commitment to remain true to the legacy of America's leadership, to make sure America remains the indispensable nation, not only for ourselves but for what we believe in and for all the people of the world. That is our burden. That is our opportunity. And it must be our future."", 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"

Congratulations on your great seasons."", ""Mayor Asher, I am delighted to be back in Daytona Beach, and I must say I thought it was beautiful when I was here 4 years ago. We spent the night, and we started out one of our bus trips here. But this beautiful downtown area is even more beautiful this year. Congratulations. I'm glad to be here."", 'I want to thank the people who appeared on the pre-program before we came: our congressional candidate, George Stuart; Ted Doran, Janet Bokum, Susanne Kosmas—Janet Bollum, let me say it right—and Susanne Kosmas, who are running for the legislature. I want to thank those who came with me here: Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson and Attorney General Bob Butterworth. I want to thank your wonderful Congresswoman, Corrine Brown, one of the most energetic people that I have ever worked with; your great Senator, Bob Graham, who served with me as Governor and is one of the most intelligent and gifted and far-sighted public servants I have ever worked with. Thank you, Bob Graham, for being here with me. And thank you, Governor Lawton Chiles, for so many things, but for proving that we can work together to make Florida and America a better place in so many ways. Thank you, sir, for your leadership.', ""I want to say more about the other two folks that are up here with me in a moment, but let me just say to Brian DeMarco, thank you, sir, for taking the time out of a different and busy career as a football player to stand up for the responsibility that all fathers have to pay child support for their children if they're not supporting them directly. You could be doing a lot of other things with your time, and you've set a great role model, a great example for America. And I thank you and the other athletes that are doing that."", 'And thank you, Ana Armstrong. Before I came out here I met with Ana and three other young women who are working and educating themselves off of welfare so that they could succeed as parents and in the work force— Lizette Riveria, Karen Watson, and Joyce Meinert—along with Marcia Bush and Gerald Frisby, who work with them. And I want to talk more about them in a moment, but I just wanted to thank them for the work they have done.', ""I'd also like to thank the people who provided our music today: Time, the Mark Hobson Band, and the Bethune-Cookman College Gospel Choir and Concert Chorale; thank you."", 'Ladies and gentlemen, I came here to Florida less than 2 weeks from the election which will elect the last President of the 20th century and the first President of the 21st century. It is your choice. You have to decide whether we\'re going to build a bridge to the future or try to build a bridge to the past. You have to decide whether to tell the American people they have to get into that future on their own, or whether that bridge is going to be big enough and wide enough for all of us to walk across together. You have to decide whether we\'re going to say to folks, ""You\'re on your own,"" or whether we\'re going to say, ""Yes, it does take a village to raise our children and build our future.""', 'Four years ago I came to Daytona Beach amid a time of high unemployment, rising frustration, and increasing division. Compared to 4 years ago we are better off, and we are on the right track to that 21st century. The unemployment rate in Florida has dropped to an 8year low. We have 10 1/2 million new jobs, a 15-year high in homeownership. We have declining crime rates for 4 years in a row and almost 2 million people fewer on welfare than there were when I took the oath of office. We are moving in the right direction.', 'Now it is for you to decide what path we will take to the 21st century. I want to ask all of you—there are a lot of young people in this audience today, and I thank you for coming. There are a lot of parents who brought their children here today and their grandchildren; I thank you for doing that. And I ask all of you when you go home tonight to take a little time in a quiet moment before you go to bed and see if you can answer this question: What do you want your country to look like when we start the 21st century, and what do you want your country to be like when your children are your age?', ""For me, it is a simple but profound issue, and it's a question as your President I deal with every day. I know what I want for America. I want us to start that new century with the American dream alive and well for every person responsible enough to work for it. I want us to keep leading the world for peace and freedom and prosperity. And I want us, amidst all our diversity, to be coming together, not to be torn apart. I want us to have families where people can succeed in raising their children and at work. I want us to live in harmony with our natural environment. And I want us to live in harmony with each other. I do not want America to be torn apart by the racial, the religious, the ethnic, the tribal hatreds that are consuming so much of the rest of the world. That is what I want for America."", ""Now, you'll have to decide what path you want to take. Your vote will decide whether we balance the budget while we protect our obligations to the future through education and the environment and protect our obligations to each other through Medicare and Medicaid, or whether we adopt a dangerous scheme that would increase the deficit, weaken the economy, and undermine the very values we seek to advance. Your vote will decide whether we build on the family and medical leave law and our efforts to protect our children from drugs and guns and gangs and tobacco, or turn back to a course that has failed in the past."", 'Your vote will decide whether we build on our efforts, so far successful, to tell people, ""No more can you lose your health insurance because somebody in your family has been sick or because you\'ve changed jobs. No more can a new mother and a newborn be kicked out of a hospital after 24 hours by an insurance company\'s office."" Your vote will decide whether we continue to add people to the ranks of health insured, whether we continue to help people, as I propose, by helping people when they are unemployed to keep their health insurance for several months more, or whether we stop that.', 'Your vote will decide whether we continue to put 100,000 police on the street, continue to follow those strategies which have brought the crime rate down for 4 years in a row until we bring it down 4 more years and everybody feels safe on our streets, in our schools, in our neighborhoods again. Your vote will decide.', ""Your vote will decide whether we keep on cleaning up the environment. We have made the air purer, our drinking water and food safer. We've cleaned up more toxic waste dumps than any administration before. We have moved to save the Florida Everglades and other national precious possessions. Your vote will decide whether we can continue to do that, or whether we will weaken our commitment to our common environment and our children's future."", ""Your vote will decide whether we can continue to advance the cause of education. Yesterday I was in south Florida at the Miami-Dade Community College, where I pointed out that we have just increased Pell grants by the largest amount in 20 years. We made 10 million American students eligible for lower cost college loans with better repayment terms so you can't go broke repaying your loans."", 'And your vote will decide which of two competing visions of education we adopt. My vision is an America in which every 8-year-old can read. We\'re going to mobilize a million volunteers to help people teach their children and to help teachers teach children to read so that every 8-year-old in America in the year 2000 can pick up a book and say, ""I can read this all by myself.""', 'Your vote will decide whether the United States, for the first time in history, helps desperately overcrowded schools in substandard conditions to build new facilities adequate to the 21st century. The United States has never helped school districts and States do this. My plan will lower the interest rates to save money for taxpayers if you make the efforts to meet the needs of your children. Your vote will decide whether we do that.', ""Your vote will decide whether we connect every classroom and every library and every school in America to that information superhighway, to the Internet, to the World Wide Web—to give all of our children access to it. And to those of you who, like me, didn't grow up in the computer age and may not understand what that means, let me tell you in plain language. If we can hook up every classroom with good computers, good educational materials, trained teachers, and access to the Internet, it means for the first time in the entire history of the United States, for the first time, every child in every school, public or private, rich, middle class, or poor, in every school, will for the first time have access to the same world of information in the same time at the same level of quality. It will revolutionize opportunity in America. Your vote will decide."", 'Your vote will decide whether finally we take a step we should have taken long ago and open the doors of college education to every single American who is willing to work and go. Under my plan, Americans will be able to deduct from their tax bill, dollar for dollar, the cost of college tuition for the first 2 years of community college after high school. I want to make at least 2 years of education after high school as universal in 4 years as a high school diploma is today.', '[At this point, an audience member required medical assistance.]', 'The President. We need my medical team over here. Hold up your hand, folks. I bring a doctor with me wherever I go. The medical team over here, right here in front.

Your vote will decide. Your vote will decide.', ""Now, let me say your vote will also decide where we go on welfare reform. Weren't you proud of Ana Armstrong when she stood up here and talked about her future and what she's going to do? [Applause] Folks, most people I've met on welfare over the last 20 years—and I've met a lot of them—are like Ana Armstrong. They don't want to be on welfare, they want to work. And they want their children to be able to look up to them and say what they do for living. They want to have a good future. But we have been saddled for too long by a system that promotes dependence and undermines people's ability to live up to their dreams, instead of one that promotes independence."", ""I ran for office in 1992, and I told you here in Daytona that I would work to end welfare as we know it and to convert it to a system that promotes independence, good parenting, and successful work. And that's exactly what we're doing. We've moved almost 2 million people from welfare to work. In Florida alone the welfare rolls have dropped 25 percent in the last 4 years, thanks to the leadership of Governor Chiles and people like those with whom I met today."", 'Brian DeMarco wants people to pay their child support. We launched an unprecedented crackdown on child support. We have used every resource available to the Federal Government. And today the National Government is releasing its statistics. Compared to 4 years ago, child support collections are 50 percent higher, almost 4 billion more dollars for the children of America—from their parents, not from the taxpayers.', 'And again, Florida has done even better. Child support collections in Florida are up over 60 percent over 4 years ago. Last month, Governor Chiles announced a program with the Miami Dolphins, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the Jacksonville Jaguars called Don\'t Drop the Ball. Brian DeMarco is saying simply to the fathers of this country, ""If you don\'t live with your children, you still ought to help support them. Don\'t drop the ball."" We\'re going to keep going until we raise child support more and more and more. We will move hundreds of thousands of people off welfare by making sure that the parents do what they ought to do, take responsibility for their children and their future. Thank you, Brian DeMarco. Thank you, Governor Chiles. Thank you, Florida.', 'Now, I signed a new welfare reform bill, and here is what it says. It says the National Government will continue to guarantee to poor families health care and food for the children and, if they go to work, more for child care than ever. But within 2 years people must move to turn that welfare check into a paycheck. Florida was one of the first three States—one of the first three—to be approved by the National Government to go forward with welfare reform.', ""Now, you have to decide, what are we going to do? It's fine to tell people they have to go to work, but there has to be work there for them and education and training. The jobs have got to be there. If you want more stories like Ana Armstrong, we have a plan, not rhetoric but a plan, to work with the private sector, to work with States, to work with communities like Daytona Beach, all over America, to move at least one million more people from welfare to work in the next 4 years. Will you help us build that bridge to the future? [Applause]"", ""So there it is. It's your choice. It's your decision. Your vote will decide, and whether you vote will decide. Don't let anybody in this community, don't let anyone you know anywhere in America believe that their vote doesn't make a difference. This is a different country than it was 4 years ago. Our country is stronger than it was 4 years ago. And 4 years from now, on the bills that we're—on that bridge we're all going to build together, we will go roaring into the 21st century with our best days ahead. Will you help us build that bridge?

And you have to decide how we're going to walk into that 21st century."", ""This is the last election for President of the 20th century and the first election for President of the 21st century. And you have to decide. Many of you young people in this audience, in a few years you will be doing jobs that haven't been invented yet. Some of you will be doing work that has not even been imagined yet. And you have to decide, what kind of America do you want? From all the way over here to way back yonder down the street, I want to ask you to do something when you go home tonight. Before you go to bed, just take a few minutes with a piece of paper and a pencil and see if you can write down the answer to this question: What do I want my country to look like when we cross that bridge into the 21st century? What do I want my country to be like when my children are my age?"", ""You know, if you ask the right question, America nearly always gives the right answer. We only get in trouble when we let ourselves get confused and start asking the wrong question. That's the right question. And when you ask that question—I tell you, I've been asking myself that question since before I made the decision to run for President in 1991. And for me the answer is simple but profound. I dream of an America in the 21st century where every person, without regard to race or region or income or religion or gender or background, who is responsible enough to work for it, can have a shot at the American dream."", ""I want an America that is still leading the world for peace and freedom and prosperity. And I want an America which is coming together, not being driven apart by our differences. And that is important. How long did we live in the shadow of our differences in the South? How much do we see around the world today, from Bosnia to the Middle East to Northern Ireland to Africa and Rwanda and Burundi, everywhere around the world, to the problems of terrorism and people sending each other dangerous weapons. What is driving it all? Racial, ethnic, religious, and tribal hatred. That's why I said the church burnings were wrong. That's why I said we couldn't go back down that road again. When we respect each other and work together there is no stopping America. There is no stopping America."", ""Now, that's my vision. You ask yourself tonight what your vision is. If you ask the right question, you'll get the right answer. What I have tried to do is to expand opportunity, increase responsibility from all citizens, and bring us together in an American community. And even though our friends on the other side don't like to admit it, we are better off than we were 4 years ago. And we are moving in the right direction."", ""The unemployment in Alabama has dropped from 7 1/2 to 4 1/2 percent. We have 10 1/2 million more jobs. The other side said they were fiscal conservatives, but our administration, with the help of Howell Heflin, reduced the deficit in all 4 years. That's the first time a President's done it in every year of his administration in the 20th century. We're moving in the right direction."", ""Incomes are on the rise again. The typical family income is up $1,600 in the last 2 years. And we're growing together again. The inequality of incomes among working people, which had become so deep in the last 20 years, had the biggest drop in 27 years last year; the biggest drop in child poverty in 20 years; the lowest rate of poverty among senior citizens ever reported since we've been keeping statistics. We are moving in the right direction to that 21st century."", ""You heard the police chief and the mayor talk about it, but we've had 4 years of declining crime rates. We've also had 4 years of declining welfare rolls. We have almost 2 million people fewer on welfare and more at work than we did 4 years ago. And child support collections have been increased by 50 percent in 4 years. People are paying for their kids more."", ""Just in the last few weeks, we raised the minimum wage for 10 million working Americans because they couldn't live on $4.25 an hour. We made 25 million working Americans eligible to keep their health insurance by saying that you can't lose your insurance anymore just because you change jobs or someone in your family has been sick. If somebody like Roger Bedford gets sick and has a spouse working, they ought not to have their insurance taken away from them; that's what health insurance is for, and that's what we have done. We also said that insurance companies can't make hospitals kick new mothers and their newborn babies out of the hospital after 24 hours anymore."", 'So we\'re moving in the right direction. And you have to decide whether you like this direction, whether you want to build a bridge to the future wide enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across, or whether you want to say, ""There\'s the future. You\'re on your own. I hope you make it; good luck."" You\'ve got to decide whether we\'re all in this together or we\'re just a swarm of isolated individuals. You\'ve got to decide, in short, whether you think it takes a village to raise a child and build a community and build a future.', ""You know, there is a lot of talk here about these labels. You know, our adversaries love labels. I'll bet you there are good professors here at Birmingham Southern who would tell you that you start throwing labels at people and calling them names when you don't have anything to argue about any more and you can't win. When the evidence is not on your side, when all else fails, call somebody a name. Maybe it'll work. That's what Senator Bedford's up against."", 'I am proud to be running on the same ticket with a person like Roger Bedford who supported our efforts to lower crime and improve education and who would represent good, old-fashioned mainstream Alabama values and modern Alabama economic, educational, and environmental interests in the United States Senate.', ""But you have to decide. When they call names, you've got to look at the facts. I want to balance the budget. I want to finish the job. We have cut that deficit 60 percent in 4 years. I want to finish the job. But we can do it while protecting Medicare and Medicaid and investing in education and investing in environmental protection. They want to pass this big, risky tax scheme that will increase the deficit, require bigger cuts than I vetoed when they shut the Government down, raise taxes on 9 million hardworking people, and allow companies to raid their workers' pension funds."", 'You have to decide. I don\'t think you need a label on that. You don\'t need to call anybody any names, just say, ""I\'m for the right kind of balanced budget, and I\'m for targeted tax cuts."" We can afford tax cuts, but they need to be targeted to help you pay for education, childrearing, buying a first home, paying for health insurance. We can afford that, and we can pay for it in our balanced budget plan. But you have to decide. Will you help us build that bridge? You have to decide.', 'Everybody is for family values, but do we value families? You heard Roger Bedford talk about the Family and Medical Leave Act. Twelve million families have benefited from that, taken a little time off from work when a baby was born or a family member was sick.', 'The other day I was down in Longview, Texas—no hotbed of liberalism—[laughter]— and I\'m shaking hands in the crowd and this woman\'s there with tears in her eyes, saying, ""Mr. President, my husband had cancer, and I was the only one in our family working. And he was desperately ill. Because of the family and medical leave law I did not lose my job, our family was not ruined, and we were able to keep going."" That was a good thing for America. That\'s not against American values; that\'s for American values.', ""The other side led the fight against it. My opponent still says it was wrong. I say it ought to be expanded to let parents go see their children's teachers once a semester and take their kids to the doctor. You have to decide."", ""You have to decide what we're going to do in health insurance. We worked hard for the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill to expand that health coverage. Now we want to say in our balanced budget plan, paid for, if you lose your job, you're between jobs, we're going to help you keep your family's health insurance for 6 months. We're going to add another million kids in low-income working families to the ranks of those who have health insurance. We're going to help families who are taking care of their parents with Alzheimer's get a little respite care so they can care for their families and still survive and keep their sanity and keep going. We're going to help women on Medicare get regular mammograms. And we're not going to turn away from medical research."", ""We're going to put a billion dollars more in medical research. Why? In the last 4 years we've doubled the life expectancy of people with HIV. We've uncovered two genes that cause breast cancer, two genes that will enable us to detect it earlier and maybe to prevent it. We have used technology that we use in space and intelligence for imaging that will help us to detect all kinds of cancers early. We have detected unbelievable things about strokes; for the first time we've got some treatment for strokes, all from medical research. We now have for the first time in history seen movement in the lower leg of laboratory animals whose spines were completely severed, because nerves were transferred from the rest of the body to the spines. We must continue to pass legislation that pushes the frontiers of knowledge and have medical research. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause] Will you help us, way back there, build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", ""Most important of all are two things to me. One is education. We are living in a world— let me just give you one example, one tiny example of how fast knowledge is exploding. We've just signed a contract, the United States did, to do a research venture with IBM to build in the next couple of years a supercomputer that will do more calculations in one second than you can do on your hand-held calculator in 30,000 years. Now, I would say in a world where knowledge is increasing like that, education is pretty important. I just want to talk about three things today."", 'Number one, kids can\'t learn if they can\'t read. Forty percent of the 8-year-olds in America today cannot read a book on their own. I have a proposal to mobilize 30,000 people— reading tutors, AmeriCorps volunteers—to get a million volunteers to go in and help parents and teachers teach our young children to read so that by the year 2000, every 8-year-old in American can pick up a book and say, ""I can read this all by myself.""', 'Secondly, I want to hook up every classroom and every library in every school in the United States to the information superhighway by the year 2000, with computers, with educational materials, with trained teachers, on the Internet, on the World Wide Web. Now, for all of you older folks like me who are not great computer geniuses, let me tell you what that means in practical terms. It means that for the very first time in history—and this is important to us in the South—for the first time in history, the children in the poorest inner-city schools, the most remote rural schools will have access in the same way at the same time at the same level of quality to the same learning that the children in the wealthiest school districts in the United States have. It has never happened before. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', ""And finally, as Senator Bedford said, we are going to make college education available to every single American of any age who needs it. I want to be able to say in the year 2000 that we've made 2 years of education after high school just as universal as a high school diploma is today. And I propose to do it not by a big, bureaucratic program but simply by saying to every American, if you want to go to a community college for 2 years, you can deduct from your tax bill, dollar for dollar, the cost of a typical community college tuition. It will revolutionize opportunity."", ""I want to say to people, you can save in an IRA, and more families can save in an IRA, but they can take the money out without any tax penalty if they use that money to educate their children or themselves, to buy a house, or take care of medical care. And yes, I'll say it again: I want to make for every form of college tuition a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year from now on. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", ""And finally, will you help me build an environment of security and good values for our children? We have to make our children safe from gangs and guns and violence and drugs. And for our children, it is illegal for them to be exposed to tobacco as well, and I'm proud that our administration has tried to stop that."", 'We are putting 100,000 police on the street. We supported the safe and drug-free schools program so that our children could hear early that drugs are wrong, drugs are illegal, drugs can kill you. We have done what we could to strengthen our control of our borders more than any administration ever has. We have also supported, as the mayor said, local initiatives like school uniforms for younger children, truancy law enforcement, curfews at night.', 'You know why? Because the crime rate was going down all 4 years I was President, but the crime rate among juveniles, people under 18, only started going down last year; because the violence rate has been going down all 4 years, but the rate of violent crime among juveniles only started going down last year; because drug use in America has dropped dramatically in the last 4 years, cocaine use down 30 percent, but drug use among children under 18 is still going up.', 'There are too many of our children out there raising themselves on the street. We need to take them back into our bosoms, into our homes, into our hearts, and give them a chance to live good, positive lives. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', ""I said the other day, and I expected to get a lot of grief from it from a lot of young people in America, that even though 90 percent of our children were clearly drug-free and had never experimented with drugs, I wanted to ask them to do something really responsible to help us find the other 10 percent before it's too late and they're too much trouble. I think we ought to have a drug test as part of the driver's license process in America to find those kids and help them before they're in trouble and before it's too late. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'Now, folks, my opponent has a different vision, and I don\'t want to get into what they said. You don\'t have to believe anything bad about him to disagree. I was raised to respect people. I told somebody the other day—they started doing all this, ""He\'s a better person""— I said, ""I don\'t know, but where I was raised, my mama would have whipped me if I ever said I was better than anybody else."" We were taught never to look down on anybody but to look up to everybody and try to lift everybody up. We were taught it in church and at home. This has nothing to do with who\'s a good or a bad person.', ""I've been in this business for some time now, although I've only lived in Washington 4 years. Let me tell you something, folks, nearly everybody I've met in public life works harder than average and tries to make a difference. This is not a question of who's good and bad, it's a question of what's right and wrong for our future. I was for the 100,000 police, and he was opposed to it. I was for the Family and Medical Leave Act, and he led the fight against it. I'm for making college education tax deductible, and he wants to eliminate the Department of Education, so that there will be nobody to speak for education in the President's Cabinet as we stand on the brink of the 21st century."", 'Our economic policies are working. Our crime policies are working. And our partnership with America for opportunity and responsibility is working. So I want to say to you, Alabama has to decide. Go home tonight, ask yourself, ""What do I want my country to look like when we cross that bridge to the 21st century?"" I know what the answer will be. Will you help us build that bridge? [Applause] Will you help us build it wide enough and strong enough for everybody to walk across? [Applause] Are you proud to be an American on the brink of America\'s greatest days? Do you believe we can make America even greater? Then you be there on November 5th, and we\'ll do it.', 'Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you.']"

Thank you. Can you hear me way in the back, back there?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Thank you. Can you hear me over by the school buses? Somebody up here can hear real well. [Laughter]', ""Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be back in Lake Charles. I did not know until I came up on this platform that I'm the first sitting President in history to visit your community. All I can say is, if the others had seen what I see here today, they would have been here a long time ago. Thank you very much. Thank you."", ""I want to thank Senator Bennett Johnston for his career, for his service to Louisiana and to the country. I will miss him very much. But you know, he was having a good time up here. I think he's enjoying this retirement. Thank you, John Breaux, for being my friend and supporter and for a great leader for Louisiana. Thank you, Congressman Cleo Fields and Congressman Bill Jefferson, for being here. Thank you, Lieutenant Governor Kathleen Blanco, Treasurer Ken Duncan, Insurance Commissioner Jim Brown, Agriculture Commissioner Bob Odom. Thank you all. Thank you, Police Jury President Allen August."", 'I know that there was speaking here earlier for the congressional candidates, Hunter Lundy and Chris John. As a Democrat, I like this Louisiana system, finally, because we have two people in our party running for the congressional seat here. Congratulations to the voters here in this parish.', 'I want to say a special word of thanks to Mayor Willie Mount for her leadership of this community and for what she said about Lake Charles and your motto, ""Moving forward together."" I want to say a little more about that in a minute. But you made us feel very welcome here today, Mayor, and we thank you.', ""I want to thank my good friend Mary Landrieu for running for the Senate and thank her for embracing and sharing the ideals that we're trying to create for America in the 21st century. And I hope every one of you will help her to help you in the United States Senate in January."", ""Let me thank Kent Kresea, the CEO of Northrup Grumman, and Jami Lowe. And also I'd like to thank Stanley Leger, the director of the SOWELA Tech College, for giving Jami the education, the opportunity and so many others the opportunity to learn the skills they need to get good jobs for the 21st century. Let's thank all three of them. [Applause]"", ""Let me say—I want to ask you to do one other thing. I asked Jami Lowe—every place I go I ask a citizen to introduce me. And the reason we do that is because I want the American people, the young people here in this audience, those of you who are registered voters, to understand every day that there is a connection between what we do a long way away in Washington and how you live in Lake Charles, and the decisions we make together shape the future we have together. But that's the first speech Jami Lowe ever made, and she had to make it to over 20,000 people to introduce the President. Let's give her another hand. I think she did a remarkable job. [Applause]"", ""I want to thank all of you here at Northrup Grumman who work on the J-STARS program. I did see it in action in Bosnia. Last month, our Department of Defense decided to acquire 19 more J-STARS for the United States Air Force, and we are trying to persuade our NATO allies to buy them for NATO. This morning the NATO Military Committee agreed that we needed an air surveillance system; now it's my job to tell them what air surveillance system we need, the J-STARS, and I'll do my best."", ""In 1992 I came here to Lake Charles and had a town meeting, and I told you if you would give me a chance to create more opportunity, create more responsibility among the American people, and bring us together more, we would be better off in 4 years. There were 100 people working at Northrup Grumman in 1992; there are 1,400 people working here today. And that story is repeated all across America as 10 1/2 million more Americans are at work, more than half of them in higher wage jobs. America's on the right track to the 21st century. We've got a 15-year high in homeownership, a 20-year low in child poverty. We've got drops in the crime rate and 2 million fewer people on welfare. This country is moving in the right direction."", ""I want to talk to you a little bit today about some of the things we need to do. And let's start with Jami Lowe. Most of the people in America who get on welfare do not want to stay on it forever. They want to get off and go to work. They want to succeed at home and at work, the same thing most families want in America. We have worked hard with States to reduce the welfare rolls. And I signed a new welfare reform bill which requires every State and every community to turn the welfare check of every able-bodied person in America into a paycheck within 2 years. That's exactly what we're going to do with more people like Jami Lowe."", ""One thing we've done is to make more absent parents pay their child support. We've increased by 50 percent the child support collections in only 4 years. Think of it; we've gone from 8 to $12 billion a year in just 4 years, and we're going to do better in the next 4. We can move 800,000 people off welfare tomorrow if people would just pay the child support they owe and they're legally bound to pay, and we intend to see that it is done."", 'But we also know that we have to create jobs if we want people to take them. That means where there are jobs available, like those here at Northrop Grumman for people like Jami, there must be education and training. That\'s why the tech college here deserves a lot of support. We intend to continue to support people with more investments in the education of the American work force. I want to make it easier for people to go back to work and get the education and training they need. I have asked Congress to pass a new ""GI bill"" for America\'s workers, to create a skills grant worth over $2,000 a year to every unemployed and grossly underemployed person in the country so everybody can go back and get the kind of training that Jami had. And I hope you will support me in that as we try to build our bridge to the 21st century. I have offered the American people a specific plan to move another million folks from welfare to work by giving special tax credits, bonuses to businesses to place people in work, by allowing local communities to actually give the welfare check to employers for a while as a job supplement to train people on the job.', ""Folks, we do not have to have a welfare system where half the people are trapped in dependency forever. We can move all the people who are able-bodied from welfare to work and make them a part of America's mainstream society if we're committed to doing it together. We're going to make people go to work; we've got to create those jobs out there for people to have. I hope you'll help me to create those jobs and change welfare forever."", ""I'd like to say a special word of thanks here in Louisiana to the Goodwill Job Connection. They have worked very hard here and in Florida to move 1,500 people from welfare to work. In Louisiana, 80 percent of them are still off welfare after 2 years. I'm telling you, folks, don't believe we can't change the welfare system. We can change it forever and for good, and we'll have every American in the mainstream, working, raising their children, being part of one society, not having some isolated forever and trapped in poverty, if you will help us and we decide to do it together in every community of America. Will you do that? [Applause]"", ""My fellow Americans, this is an important election, and you have to decide. The people you vote for and the decision you make whether to vote will determine what kind of future the children in this audience have. The kids here today, before you know it, they'll be doing jobs that haven't been invented yet. A lot of these young kids will be doing jobs that have not even been imagined yet. The world is changing rapidly."", ""You will decide whether we balance our budget and keep our economy going, whether we do it without gutting our commitment to the future through education and environmental protection, whether we do it without undermining the commitments of Medicare and Medicaid. You will decide whether we have targeted tax cuts to help families educate their children and raise them and buy a first home and deal with medical emergencies. You will decide. That's a big part of building a bridge to the 21st century. And I hope you will decide, yes, that's the way we have to build that bridge. Will you do that? [Applause]"", ""You will decide whether we continue to support policies that help our families succeed at home and at work. Twelve million people have taken a little time off from work when a baby was born or a family member was sick. And we still have record numbers of new businesses, record job growth. The family and medical leave law has made us a stronger, better country. I want to see it narrowly expanded so people can go to parent-teacher conferences with their kids and take their family members to doctor's appointments. That will make America a stronger country. You will decide. I hope you will decide to do it ."", ""You will decide whether we continue to move forward on health care reform. Just before I left, Congress—we passed a law which I've been working for hard, which says now to people, you cannot be taken—your health insurance can't be taken away anymore just because you changed jobs or somebody in your family gets sick. That could protect 25 million Americans in their health insurance. And we also passed a law that says insurance companies can't force new mothers and newborn babies out of the hospital in 24 hours anymore. We're going to protect that."", ""Now, you will decide whether we adopt my balanced budget plan, which helps families that lose their jobs or between jobs keep health insurance for their children for 6 more months. That is your decision, and I hope you will decide to help us build that bridge to the 21st century. You will decide whether we keep putting 100,000 police on our streets. It's led to 4 years of decline in our crime rate. You will decide whether we continue to help keep our kids away from drugs and gangs and guns and violence. You will decide whether we continue to support the safe and drug-free schools program as we have or cut back on it as our opponents have proposed."", 'Most important of all for these young people here, you will decide whether we make a major new commitment to guarantee every child in America a world-class education. I want you to help me do three things.', 'Number one, 40 percent of the 8-year-olds in this country can still not read well enough on their own, and we know if our children can\'t read, they can\'t keep learning. I propose to take 30,000 AmeriCorps volunteers and reading specialists to go across this country and mobilize a million volunteers to go and help the parents and the schools of this country, so that by the time we start that new century, every single 8-year-old in America can pick up a book and say, ""I can read this all by myself.""

Now, if you're older like me and you don't understand all that computer stuff, let me tell you in plain language what that means. If we make sure all of our classrooms have computers, educational materials, trained teachers, and they're hooked up to the Internet and the World Wide Web and all these other networks, here's what that means. It means for the first time in history, in the poorest school districts in Louisiana and Arkansas, in the most remote rural districts in the high plains of the United States, in the toughest inner-city school districts—for the first time ever in those school districts—in the middle class districts, in the rich districts, in the schools, public and private, for the first time ever, every child will have access to the same information in the same way at the same time. It will revolutionize education in America, and I want you to help me do it for our children and our future."", 'And the last thing I ask you to do is to help me open the doors of college education for all. I want to make sure every person in this country, of any age, who wants to go back to school can do it. I propose to give families in this country a tax credit, a dollar-for-dollar reduction on their taxes for the costs of the typical tuition at a community college or a technical school, for 2 years of education after high school. I want to let families save in an IRA for years but then be able to withdraw from it without any tax penalty if they use the money for education or buying a home or health care. And I want to give the families of Louisiana and America a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year for the cost of any college tuition. It should not be taxed, the education of our children and of their parents, as we move into the information age. Will you help me do that? [Applause]', 'Folks, when the mayor opened the program, she said that Lake Charles\' motto was ""moving forward together."" And then I saw this editorial in the morning newspaper that says, ""Mr. President, this area is a success."" And the editorial said, ""Oh, yes, we\'ve had some help from the Federal Government, but most of it we did ourselves with citizen spirit."" Well, I agree with that. I agree with that.', ""But you have to decide whether we're going to move forward together and whether the President, the Congress, and the National Government are going to be your partner to help people have the tools to make the most of their own lives, to build strong careers, strong families, and strong communities. I've tried to be that kind of partner. I'm proud that this country is better off than it was 4 years ago. I'm glad we're on the right track to the 21st century.

You have to decide."", ""If you want Lake Charles to move forward together; if you believe that in order to have a successful work environment, you have to move forward together; if when you go to church on Sunday, you like to be sitting there with people who are committed to moving forward and learning together; if you believe your family has to work by people working together, shouldn't your country work that way too? Shouldn't your country work that way too? [Applause]"", ""You know, there's been a lot of debate about it in this country. But I believe the First Lady was right; I think it does take a village to raise a child, to build a community, to build a country, to build a future.

We dare not walk away from our children and their future. We do not need to sacrifice our environment to grow our economy.', ""All we need to do is to make a commitment to build that bridge and to move forward together.

My good friend Congressman Bill Jefferson, who plays both sides of the river here, and that's good politics. Sometimes it's not good in public life to straddle the fence, but I picked up pretty quick it's a good thing to straddle this river. [Laughter] If his in-laws hadn't been from here, I think he would have moved them over here just to make sure he was covered."", ""Thank you, my good friend Senator John Breaux, for all you do for Louisiana and all you've done for me. Thank you, and God bless you, sir. Thank you, Mary Landrieu, for running for the Senate and for standing up for what is right and supporting our crime programs. Thank you."", ""And Sheriff, thank you. I want to thank everybody in the sheriff's department who's worked on this program. I understand that Deputy Chief Gus Clavery has done a lot of work on it and others have. But this STAR program is an example of an issue that I think is very important."", 'When I ran for President, I found people all over America frustrated and angry by the crime problem but nearly resigned to it. There were no new ideas in many places, so people said, ""Just throw the book at them and leave me alone, and I\'ll duck and dodge the bullets""— everywhere. But there were, thank goodness, a number of local leaders in law enforcement like Harry Lee—there isn\'t really nobody like Harry Lee, but you know what I mean. [Laughter]', ""People that—I wasn't going to say this, but I'm going to say this. As you know, it's fairly well known throughout the country that I enjoy a meal now and then. [Laughter] And last time I came to New Orleans—I always love to come here, and I'm always angry if they make me leave without eating when I'm in here. So Harry took John Breaux and me to lunch, and I was finally with somebody I didn't have to be a bit embarrassed by enjoying my lunch with. I loved it. I loved it. And we had a good one, didn't we, Sheriff? [Laughter]"", ""But the important thing—let me get back to this. Law enforcement leaders like Harry Lee who understood—and I found them all around America—that it wasn't only important to do things right, it was important to do the right things, which is very different. It was one thing for a person with a badge and a uniform on to look tough, be strong, and not do anything wrong, and quite another thing for a person to always be searching out new ideas, ways to involve people in not only solving crime but preventing crimes in the first place."", ""You heard him say up here when he talked— he just picked up on something I mentioned at lunch about the way New York City had dramatically lowered the crime rate by radically increasing its ability to move law enforcement officers around every day among neighborhoods based on where the crime was moving. So I come—the next time I come to Louisiana, he tells me he's instituted the same thing. That's what we need, local leadership, citizens like Yvonne McPherson, dedicated officers like Renee Washington, and law enforcement leaders like Harry Lee who want to do the right things as well as do things right."", ""And I was astonished when I ran for President the extent to which people on the one hand were screaming for something to be done about crime and on the other hand, absolutely believed nothing could be done about it. Deep down inside they had sort of given up, but they wanted us to make the right moves and make some right noises but they didn't really believe we could take our streets, our schools, our neighborhoods, and ultimately, our children back."", ""And I began to see things that changed my mind. I've told this story a lot of times, but I made a good friend one night early in 1992 when I was dropping in the polls in New Hampshire and people were writing my obituary. I went to New York City to a fundraiser, and frankly, I was a pretty sad case. I was feeling sorry for myself. And I was walking through the kitchen to get around like we sometimes do, to get around to where I was going to give the speech."", 'And a Greek immigrant with a waiter\'s uniform stopped me. And he said, ""Now, Mr. President, my son is 10. He\'s in the fifth grade; he studies this election. He says I should vote for you, so I think I will vote for you, if you will do one thing for me."" I said, ""What do you want? "" He said, ""I want to make my boy free."" And I said, ""Well, sir,"" I said, ""Mr. Theofanis, this is a democracy."" He said, ""Yes it is, but my boy is not free."" He said, ""Where I lived before, I was poor, much poorer than I am here in New York. But at least we were free. Here, across the street from our apartment in New York, there is this beautiful park. I can\'t let my child go to the park unless I go with him. I\'m lucky I live only 2 blocks from the school and it\'s actually quite a good school, but my boy can\'t walk down the street to the school unless I go with him. So I\'ll vote for you, but you have to make my boy free.""', 'And I heard stories like this all over America. But I also saw neighborhoods in Los Angeles where the police had cut the response time down to 2 minutes. I saw streets in Philadelphia that had been infested by gangs and drugs, where neighborhood groups had worked with the police to take their streets back. And just a little bit, here and there I would see these glimmers of hope, and I promised myself that if I got elected President, I was going to take the politics out of crime and try to put the police and the people back into the business of lowering the crime rate and bringing safety back to America and restoring fundamental freedom.', ""Now, the crime bill that you've heard everybody brag on—I appreciate that, all the credit they're trying to give me. All I did was take the politics out of crime. All we did was to let law enforcement people and community activists, like the folks that have spoken tonight, tell us what the Federal Government ought to do to be a good partner to help communities take their streets back and give their kids a future back. That is all we did."", ""But as it turned out, that was quite a lot, because for 6 years, the debate in Washington had been a bunch of rhetoric and who could talk the toughest and who could do the least because we didn't want anything to make any of the organized groups mad. And the problem was, nothing ever got done. So all we did was to let law enforcement officials, in effect, tell us what ought to be done, let community activists tell us what ought to be done; that's what the '94 crime bill was about."", 'It\'s been a remarkable 4 years in the area of fighting crime. In this crime bill, we agreed that over a 5-year period, we\'d fund 100,000 police. After only 2 years, we\'ve funded almost half of them, so we\'re ahead of schedule and under budget. As the sheriff said, there were no strings in this bill except one. There was just one string; the money had to be spent to hire law enforcement officers who would go on the street, not behind a desk. That was the only string. We said, ""You figure out who to hire; you figure out how to train them; you decide how to deploy them; you decide how you\'re going to relate to the community. It\'s all your decision. We don\'t know in Washington how to do that.""', ""But we do know that in 30 years the violent crime rate has tripled and the police forces have only gone up by 10 percent in this country. There's no way you could do it. We had place after place after place that were more violent without any more police officers and they were covering less because they had to go around two at a time and then they had to get in the car, so nobody was on the street. And we were losing the battle because we weren't doing the right things. So that's all we tried to do."", 'We also passed the ""three strikes and you\'re out"" law for people who are prosecuted in Federal court for serious crimes. They do it a third time, they\'re not eligible for parole, not ever— and life in prison. We passed the capital punishment for drug kingpins and people who kill our law enforcement officers in the line of duty. We passed a strong safe and drug-free schools program to give our little children something to say yes to, to put more of those D.A.R.E. officers and other people out there in the classrooms when the kids were in grade school, saying drugs are wrong, drugs are illegal, drugs can kill you.', ""We're giving schools more funds to stay open later. I've fought to maintain the summer jobs program. I've fought to try to give our young people something to say yes to. I'm now trying to make sure we open the doors of college education to everybody, so no young person has to worry about whether they'll be able to afford to go to college if they stay in school and stay off drugs and stay out of trouble and make their grades. I think that's important. That's important."", ""We've also tried to support more people like Yvonne in citizens groups. Over the next 4 years, we're going to try to mobilize another million volunteers to work with the police to get the crime rate down. San Diego, California, has the lowest crime rate of any of the 10 big cities in America, even though it's right on the border where we're constantly fighting illegal immigration and people trying to bring drugs across the border. In any of the 10 biggest cities, they've got the lowest crime rate. Why? One reason is, they have hundreds and hundreds of retired people who work in these citizens groups with the police not only to catch criminals but to keep crime from happening in the first place, watching out for the little kids on the street, watching out for their neighbors. They know whenever somebody's gone on vacation, they watch their home, they work together. So this is something we've got to do together."", ""There's more to be done. We have to continue to support these police officers. You know, Harry Lee and I were laughing—I once had a lifetime membership in the NRA; I think it's been revoked now because I stood up for the Brady bill. But we didn't take any guns away from hunters or sportsmen, not a single one. We haven't done that. But at least 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers couldn't get guns. Now if you beat up your wife or your kids, you can't get a handgun under the new law. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. I would oppose any effort to undermine my ability to duck hunt— [laughter]—or anybody's ability to be a championship skeet shooter or to do anything else that's appropriate and legal. But I still think we ought to ban those bullets that are built only for one purpose, to pierce the bulletproof vests that our police officers wear. I don't see why we need those things out there."", ""Let me tell you, we just started this program 2 years ago, as I said, when I signed the crime bill in 1994. Today I met with the first—the family of the first one of the police officers hired under our crime bill killed in the line of duty. I met here in Louisiana, in Lake Charles—I met with that officer's widow and two beautiful, beautiful young sons. And I thought to myself, you know, if people like these folks here are going to put their lives on the line for us, the least we can do is tell them if they put on a bulletproof vest, it will protect them from being killed. That's the least we can do for them."", ""What I want you to believe is, number one, this is not an accident, what Harry Lee said about reducing the violent crime rate and the crime rate by 85 percent. That is not an accident. That happened because people did the right things. The second thing I want you to believe is the Federal Government—your President and the Congress—we can make a difference, and we are. But we're not doing it because of our political connections or philosophy. We're doing it because we took the politics out of crime. The third thing I want you to know is this could all be reversed. In the budget I vetoed last year, that the majority in Congress passed, they eliminated the 100,000 police program. Again, I had to stop them from trying to cut back on it. For reasons I do not understand, they do not believe in it. They tried to cut the safe and drug-free schools program in half. Drug use is going down in America, folks, big time. But drug use among children under 18 is still going up. The last thing we need to do is to cut back on safe and drugfree schools effort. We need more adults in those schools talking to those kids."", ""And my newest proposal, which is probably going to get me in trouble with some of the young people in America, but I want to say, look, 90 percent of our kids are drug-free and we need to support them and we need to lift up the good kids and we need to give them something to say yes to. I want to say that again. We need to say it. But I'm going to ask those 90 percent to do something that may be unpopular with them. I'm going to ask them to go along with my proposal to get every State in the country to make a drug test part of getting a driver's license so we can find the other 10 percent and save their lives and help them and give them a chance for the future."", 'I say again, you deserve most of the credit here, the sheriff, Lieutenant Washington, Yvonne McPherson, all of you that work in this, these police officers. You deserve the credit. But we have to do our part. And we have tried to do our part. And I want you to sustain this effort by what you say on November 5th.', ""And I know what Mary Landrieu will say; she'll stay with us. She'll support us. And that's important. So I want you to help by sending people to Washington who will continue to take crime fighting out of politics and give it back to the people of every neighborhood in America. That's important, and Mary will do that. That's important."", ""And I want you to continue to support these efforts here. But just remember this—if you don't remember anything else, remember this: This is an example of what we can do when we stop talking and start acting and when we reach across the lines that divide us and join hands and agree on things that we all agree on. We do not have to put up with unacceptable rates of crime and violence. We do not have to put up with what I have seen in America."", ""We're almost to Halloween now. Just a couple of years ago in Baltimore—where the mayor has labored mightily on this—there was this wonderful young man, 17 years old, his whole life before him, took two little kids out trickor-treating so they would be safe. And somebody shot him from across the street and ended his life just for kicks. Last year in Washington, in a suburb, a 13-year-old honor student standing innocently at a school bus stop—a city bus stop, shot down just because he happened to be standing in the wrong place in a drive-by shooting. You don't have to put up with that. You don't have to give up your children to that. You don't have to do that. We can make a difference."", ""We are making a difference, and you're making a difference here. And I will do my best for 4 more years to make sure we have 4 more years of declining crime here in Jefferson Parish."", 'Thank you, and God bless you.']"

Mayor Campbell, thank you for your indefatigable enthusiasm and for your positive leadership of this great city. Billy Payne, thank you for your support and for making the Atlanta games the greatest games in the history of the Olympics. You did a brilliant job.', ""To all the political leaders who are here, the State elected officials, Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney and the others who are here—she's still fighting, and she's going to be rewarded on election day—I thank you all."", ""Georgia has given many great leaders to America: Martin Luther King; President Jimmy Carter; my great friend of many years John Lewis, who talked about building his own bridges today; Zell Miller, who has given the Nation an idea with the HOPE scholarships in Georgia. But when the history of this era is written, there will be few people who have made the contribution to our security and our future that Senator Sam Nunn has, and we are all in his debt. Sam Nunn was one of the first people who convinced me that we ought to have a national service program to give young people a chance to serve in their communities and earn their way through college, and 60,000 young Americans have been part of AmeriCorps. Thank you, Sam Nunn, for that. Sam Nunn led the fight to get Congress to appropriate funds to help the Russians pay to tear up their nuclear missiles and their nuclear missile sites. And he's one of the big reasons that there are no Russian missiles targeted at the young people of the United States of America today. Thank you, Senator Sam Nunn."", 'And Georgia is about to be given a chance to add another person to the list of distinguished nationally significant servants of the people of this great State and our country. And I hope you will send Max Cleland to the United States Senate. You know, every time we have an election, someone stands up and starts talking about sacrifice and serving your country. I think we all know that Max Cleland knows something about sacrifice and serving our country. And yet, he just kept on giving. He never quit giving to America. And——', '[At this point, there was a disturbance in the audience.]', ""The President. You all relax. When people don't have a side of their own to make, they try to shout their opponents down. Just relax. Just relax."", ""Let me tell you, Max Cleland has kept on giving for a lifetime, with a smile on his face and a song in his heart, always reaching out his hand to other people. Now, the other side, their idea of sacrifice is to take Head Start away from 5-year-olds, college loans away from students, to take the environment away from all of our people, and to weaken our future economy for short-term promises. I think Max Cleland's idea of service to America is the right one, and I believe Georgians will agree. [Applause] Thank you."", ""Now, you know, I want to talk most, if anything, to the young people today. This is your election, and we need you. You have most of your tomorrows in front of you, you have your future out there ahead of you, and you have to decide about that. I appreciate what Senator Nunn said about the last 4 years. It is true that we're better off than we were. It is true that we have more jobs, that the other side talked about being conservative but our administration is the first one to take the deficit down in each of our 4 years in the 20th century. It is true that the other guys talked about how bad the big old Federal Government was, but it's our administration working with our allies in Congress who has cut the size of the Federal Government, the number of regulations, the number of Government programs, and we have privatized more Government operations than the last two Republican administrations did in 12 years combined. That's the truth."", 'But there is a difference. We still believe that we have responsibilities to move forward together. And that\'s what you have to decide, all you young people, whether you want a future in which you\'re told, ""You\'re on your own, and we hope you have a nice life,"" or whether you believe it does take a village to raise a child, protect the environment, and build a future. You have to decide. You have to decide.', ""What is this future of yours going to be like? Well, we know it will be dominated by information and technology. We know that ideas and information and money and technology will move around the world in a split second. We know that the borders that divide us will increasingly come down and we'll be drawn closer together with people all around the world. We know there will be new security threats even as the cold war fades away: terrorism, the proliferation of chemical and biological and other sophisticated weapons. We know that ethnic and racial and religious hatreds can cross national borders. We know all that."", 'And we know that there will be new challenges to the way we work and live and relate to each other. We know today, already, that most parents, even parents with very comfortable incomes, face repeated challenges in fulfilling their obligations to their children as parents and succeeding in the workplace. We know there will be a lot of changes.', ""When Becky Ahmann was up here talking, she told you how she was able to leave her business in New York, move to Georgia, and keep working for her business in New York by working at home. When I became President, there were 3 million Americans doing that; today there are over 12 million Americans like Becky Ahmann. When we start that new century just 4 years from now, there will be 30 million Americans like her. That's how fast we're changing."", ""We know we're pushing back the frontiers of knowledge. We have funded a project with IBM to develop a supercomputer in the next couple of years that will do more calculations in a second than you can do on your handheld calculator in 30,000 years."", ""We have seen for the first time in history laboratory animals with their spines completely severed having movement in their lower limbs because of nerve transplants from other parts of their body to their spines. It's just a matter of time until we can do that for Americans and for people all over the world. We have uncovered, in the last 4 years, two of the genes which cause breast cancer. It's just a matter of time until we have the earliest possible detection and eventually prevention. Because of the space program, we have developed sophisticated imaging technology that soon we can put across human bodies and find cancers in their very incipiency so that we'll be able to save more lives than ever before. We have more than doubled the life expectancy for people who have HIV and AIDS in the last 4 years; it's on the verge of becoming a chronic illness."", ""These things have happened. That is the world we have to prepare for. And that is the world you must decide about. And so I say to you: If you want to have a future and a world like that, like I do, where everybody has a chance to live up to their God-given capacity, where everyone who is responsible should have a chance to live out their dreams, where everybody respects everyone else's right to work and live and we come together in a community, we're not divided, race against race, man against woman, among each other, if that is the America you want, then you have some responsibilities, too."", 'You must decide whether you want to balance the budget to keep our economy growing while we protect our investments in education, the environment, Medicare, Medicaid, and research or whether you want to adopt a risky scheme that will blow a hole in the deficit, require bigger cuts in those things, and take us backward. That is your decision. The young people of America must decide that.', ""You must decide whether you believe we can improve the environment and grow the economy. I know we can. Today, the air is cleaner, your drinking water is safer, your food is safer. We have set aside more lands for national parks. We are saving the Florida Everglades. We protected Yellowstone Park from a gold mine. But we are also making America economically healthier. And if you will help me, I'll do something I know is close to John Lewis' heart. In the next 4 years we're going to clean up 500 more toxic waste sites so our kids will be growing up next to parks, not poison."", ""This is an important election for young people. You will have to decide whether we are going to reform a welfare system in a way that gives poor people a real chance. It's one thing to say to people, you must go to work if you're able-bodied.

You will have to decide."", ""More than anything else, you will have to decide if you really believe now that we've gotten the crime down to a 10-year low—the crime rate has gone down 4 years in a row in America. We can actually make our streets safe again if we do more to prevent our kids from getting in trouble in the first place, to finish the job of putting 100,000 police on the street, to keep the safe and drug-free schools program alive in our schools.

I also challenged these young people to take some time to serve in their communities, especially to teach young children to read.', ""And I guess that I'd like to begin by saying I ran for President not only to enact certain policies that I think are important for the 21st century—to give us a strong economy, a clean environment, the world's best educational system, a way of dealing with the problems abroad to make America safer and more secure, and a way of driving down the crime rate and the violence rate here at home—I had certain policies I wanted to implement, but I also wanted to change the way our country was working."", ""Politics for so long in America has been about dividing people, and at the national level especially, the whole rhetoric, the language that you use, the labels that are put on people, always about dividing us one from another, whereas that's not the way we run anything else. Those of you that are listening to me, you couldn't run a church that way. Atlanta couldn't have put on the Olympics that way. We're having a brilliant Major League World Series; if all of a sudden one of the teams starts calling their own team members names in public, they're not going to win. I tell you, whichever team does that, the other team is going to win. And so our national politics had gotten to the point where we were running it the way we wouldn't run our families, our businesses, our churches, our common community endeavors."", 'Yesterday I was in the town of Lake Charles, Louisiana—has a very dynamic young woman mayor named Willie Mount. And she got the community, which is a very biracial and increasingly multiethnic community, to adopt the slogan of ""moving forward together."" Atlanta now, I think, is one of the, literally, the urban centers of the world because 40 years ago it became the city too busy to hate. And yet, national politics was dominated essentially by negative political ads and name-calling. And we changed all that.', ""I wanted to have an administration that looked like America and an administration that worked more like the other things that work in America. And one of the reasons I spend so much time on community colleges and one reason I try to open the doors of college to every American, to make sure every person would be guaranteed at least 2 years of education after high school is that I think our country ought to work more the way these community colleges do. If you go to one, they're not bureaucratic; they're flexible; they're changing all the time. They have to meet high standards of performance or they go broke. Everybody that graduates from them gets hired. And they're open to everybody, and everybody is treated the same. That's what I'm trying to do for America."", ""So I'm proud of the results we've achieved. It's not only true that the overall economy is better, but we have, according to the Government statistics from the Census Bureau just last month, the biggest decline in inequality among working people in 27 years, the biggest drop in child poverty in 20 years, the biggest drop in poverty among female head of households in 30 years, and the lowest overall poverty rate among African-Americans and American senior citizens ever recorded."", ""Now, African-Americans have had a higher increase in their average earnings in the last 2 years, even in the overall economy. And things like homeownership, which is at a 15-year high overall, are much up among African-Americans. The Small Business Administration has doubled its loans overall and tripled its loans to women and minorities. And we haven't been making loans that violate our standards of quality. We're just outreaching, working hard, trying to move this country together and move this country forward."", ""I'm sure most of you on this phone call know we have appointed more African-Americans to important positions in the Cabinet and the White House, in the administration, on the Federal bench than any other administration in history by a good long ways. And yet, I'm proud of the fact that my Federal judges, even though there have been more women and minority appointments by far than any previous administration, the American Bar Association has given higher ratings to my Federal judges than any other President since the rating system began, which proves we can have excellence and diversity, which proves you can have affirmative action and equal opportunity and high standards."", 'When we were fighting for the battle over affirmative action, the battle which still rages in our country, and it became all the rage to just say, ""Let\'s get rid of it,"" I said, ""No, we ought to mend it, not end it."" And I believe my view is beginning to prevail in the world and in the United States.', 'I was in Houston the other day, which is hardly a bastion of strength for the Democratic Party. And the mayor there, who is a very talented mayor, explicitly, forthrightly, and aggressively defended the city\'s affirmative action policy and still won support for reelection from over 80 percent of the people in his city. And so I think our ""mend it, not end it"" policy in the end will prevail.', ""I believe that the economic efforts we have made are important. You know, our campaign became the first campaign ever to invest some of the money that we have to save—that we get from the taxpayers and we have to save to pay bills and make up for any mistakes that have been made and make sure all the accounting is right—Peter Knight, our campaign chairman, announced that we were going to deposit millions of dollars in four leading minority banks in America. No campaign had ever done this— two African-American banks, including the Citizens Trust here in Atlanta, and two Hispanic banks—and I'm proud of that."", 'The empowerment zones that we created and the enterprise communities we created, and the community development banks that we created, including one worth almost $500 million in Los Angeles, these are beginning to loan money to people and to create jobs. In Detroit, under the leadership of Mayor Archer—when I took office, the Detroit unemployment rate was nearly 9 percent. Today, the unemployment rate in Detroit is 4 1/2 percent. The empowerment zone has generated $2 billion in private sector capital.', 'So we can turn our cities around. In virtually every city in the country there has been a big drop in the violent crime rate as we put more police officers on the street and adopt strategies to prevent crime from happening in the first place.', ""So I believe we're moving in the right direction there. We still have a lot of challenges in the future, and I'd just like to mention two or three, if I might, that you can play a particular role in."", ""Our young people are still faced with a lot of challenges. And you know that as well as I do. If anyone had told me 4 years ago we could bring the violent crime rate in America down 4 years in a row to a 10-year low, but we just barely make a dent in crime among young people, people under 18, I would have had a hard time believing that. If anyone had told me 4 years ago our efforts would stem a lot of the flow of drugs into America, we'd have a 30 percent decline in cocaine use and a 13 percent decline in overall casual drug use among adults, especially young adults, but drug use would go up among children under 18, I would have had a hard time believing that. So we've got some challenges to meet there, and let me just make some suggestions."", ""First of all, we should do no harm; we should keep doing what we've been doing, getting that message out in our churches and in our schools that drugs are illegal and wrong and can kill you. We definitely should not do what the other side wants to do, which is to cut the safe and drug-free schools program. We need more things for our children to say yes to. We shouldn't cut our school programs that—we're giving funds now to schools to stay open after school so kids will have something else to do. We're trying to help our cities start things like sports leagues to give kids positive things to be involved in, to increase recreational opportunities."", ""And so the fight I had with folks in the other party when they wanted to cut out the summer job program or cut back on the safe and drugfree schools program and undermine that is that I just don't think you can punish these children into obedience. I think we have to lead them into a good, harmonious, positive life. If somebody does something terrible and they need to be punished and put in jail, fine, let's do that. But first we have to try to give them a chance to have a better life."", ""And let me just say one other thing. Last week, I asked our young people to make a little sacrifice to serve our country, and I hope you will help me sell it, because I know a lot of them won't like it. But it's important to point out that 90 percent of our children are still drug-free. Ninety percent of these kids are out there doing the right thing, trying to be good citizens. But still, to have 10 percent, or nearly 11 now, having experimented with drugs is too many, when we had it down to about 5 1/2 or 6 percent just a few years ago."", ""And so I think that we ought to make a drug test a part, a regular part, of getting a driver's license. Now, we know that for 90 percent of the kids, they don't need it, but if they'll do that and be responsible and help us, how many of these other children are we going to be able to find and save before they get in serious trouble and before it's too late? I think this is very important."", ""And the last point I'd like to make is this: We have to keep growing the economy, and we have to keep moving people into work, and we have to do it in the right way. In the last 4 years, I'm very proud of the fact that we've moved about 2 million people from welfare to work and we've increased child support collections by almost 50 percent, right at $4 billion a year."", ""The welfare reform bill poses a special challenge to all of us, but it also give us a terrific opportunity. Because what it says is, we'll keep paying for the health care and the food for poor families as a national guarantee for all poor families. If someone moves from welfare to work we will spend more on child care than ever before. But that portion of the Federal Government's money that used to go to the welfare check will now go to States and by extension, the local communities. And everybody will have 2 years to figure out how to turn that welfare check into a paycheck."", ""Now, this is a terrific opportunity for us. And let me give you an example—Mayor Cleaver is on the phone here—in Kansas City 2 years ago we gave them the chance to do something I've been begging every State in America to do. We gave them all the welfare funds, and we said that you could have permission to give employers a welfare check as a wage supplement for up to 4 years if they will hire people off welfare in creating new jobs, not replacing people. And we'll guarantee that they'll be able to keep their Medicaid for several years if they go to work in a business that doesn't give health insurance."", 'Almost immediately hundreds of people got jobs. And businesses that never thought they would even consider hiring anybody off welfare before did it and could afford to help train the people because they were getting the welfare check as a wage supplement.', 'Now, I want to challenge all the pastors here—you can think about that, if that option were given to you, you might be able to do such a thing as that. You might be able to add to the church staff if the local folks would give you the welfare check and say, ""Here is the welfare check; this is the premium we\'re paying you to train folks, to see after their kids, and make sure they\'re all right and they\'re going into the future.""', ""We can do this. This is the right way to do it. We're going to give special targeted tax credits to private sector businesses to do the same thing. This is the right way to do it. We don't have the ability to have a big Government public works job, and we want all these families to be brought into the mainstream. They need homes and neighborhoods and support systems. And we can do this."", ""Now, all of this depends upon this election. And that's the last thing I want to say. Your vote will decide this election. But whether you vote will also decide this election. And I can do a pretty good job of saying no if I have to. I've shown that I know how to sign that veto pen pretty good."", ""But we also want to say yes to America— to a new direction, to keep this economy growing, to keep preserving the environment, to clean up these toxic waste sites in our cities so our children will be growing up next to parks, not poison, to continue to expand health care coverage to people when they're unemployed for 6 months, to expand coverage to a million more children—all this is in my balanced budget plan—to provide mammograms to women who are on Medicare, to help families care for a member who has Alzheimer's, to give them a little time off. All this is in our balanced budget plan—to open the doors of college education to all. All these things require affirmative steps to move America forward."", 'And you can look at these races all across America, and you can look—a lot of States in the Presidential race are very close, and the outcome will be determined by the turnout.', ""Don't be fooled by the polls. In the first place, the polls don't count much in Presidential elections; it's who wins the largest number of States. You know, I could win one State by two to one and Senator Dole could win two States by one vote, and I'd have lots more votes, and he'd have more electoral votes."", ""And let me tell you, that's not an accident. We've had two times in American history where the person with the most votes lost the White House. This turnout question is not an academic question. Twice already in American history, the President—the person that ran for President, got the most votes, actually lost the White House. The choice of the people didn't serve. The choice of the States served. We still have the system we started with."", ""We won Georgia in 1992 by eight-tenths of one percent. The last poll had us 6 percent ahead on Saturday night before the election. And you may remember, I came here, and Senator Nunn and Governor Miller and Hank Aaron and I did a rally in a stadium outside Atlanta. We had over 25,000 people there. But on election day—and the 6-point poll was right, but on election day they showed up in higher numbers than we did. That's what happened. We won New Jersey by one percentage point. We won Ohio by 2 percentage points. And I could go on and on and on and on."", ""So in the President's race, in the Senate races, in the House races, in the governorships, it's not—the choice people make for their future is not just for whom they vote, but it's whether they vote."", 'Now, you know what to do. You know how to do it. I think every one of you listening to me today understands the profound historic significance of this vote.', ""But I just sit here—I'm in Georgia today, we just left this rally, so I'm thinking especially about Max Cleland. It's hard to imagine an American serving in public life today who sacrificed more for his country than Max Cleland, a man who nearly gave his life, gave up three of his limbs to serve America in the war in Vietnam. But he's still out there with a smile on his face, a song in his heart, trying to serve the public—being attacked as being too liberal? Is he? I don't think so."", ""It's just that his idea of sacrifice is not taking Head Start away from children or telling people they can't have a college loan or telling young people who live in poor inner-city neighborhoods they have to go on living by their toxic waste dumps because we're going to cut environmental enforcement and environmental protection. His idea of service is helping other people to make the most of their own lives so that the sacrifice he made so many years ago is for the America of his dreams. And that's why I so—I want Max Cleland to win. He is a remarkable man. I've known him many, many years. He's a wonderful man."", ""It all depends on the turnout. So I ask you all to think about that. Do what you can. You know what to do. You know how to do it. And if we all show up, we'll have a real celebration on November 5th."", 'Thank you.']"

Zell Miller spoke at the '92 convention about growing up in a house his mother built herself with her own hands. It was about the most moving talk I ever heard at one of those political conventions, maybe because it was so personal, so human, and because the political positions that Zell Miller holds flow out of the experience of his life. He's been a teacher, a United States marine, and a brilliant, brilliant Governor of Georgia. He wrote the new platform that the Democrats are running on."", 'And I got so tickled when our friends met in San Diego and their nominee, my opponent, said—they said, ""Well, what about this platform.

There are some AmeriCorps folks out here; Sam Nunn was out there supporting national service before I became President. And when I got in office I was able to take the advocacy that Sam Nunn had had for so long, and now we've given 60,000 Americans a chance to serve in their local community, to solve problems at the grassroots level, and pay their way through college. Thank you, Sam Nunn."", 'Senator Nunn told you that very moving story about seeing the Russian nuclear sub destroyed. But he was characteristically too modest. I wrote him a letter the other day and I said, ""Senator, when the history of this era is written and people talk about how the cold war came to an end and how we moved into a bright new day of security, the name of Sam Nunn will loom large."" Because it was Sam Nunn\'s leadership, along with Senator Dick Lugar, that got the funds through Congress that helped us to contribute to the effort to make sure that the nuclear missiles were removed from the non-Russian Republics of the former Soviet Union and helped us to reduce nuclear arsenals by twothirds and helped make sure that today, as we stand here in Macon, Georgia, there are no Russian missiles targeted at the United States of America. Thank you, Sam Nunn.', ""I want to thank those of you who have anything to do with Robins Air Force Base. It did win the President's award as the finest Air Force base in the world last year.

We would stop pointing our fingers and saying who's to blame, and we would start saying, what are we going to do to make America a better place together? And that's what we've done."", ""If we could build a new majority in America on three principles, opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where if you show up for work tomorrow and you believe in our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, our Declaration of Independence, we don't need to know anything else about you.

We have incomes going up for the first time in 20 years for middle income working people. We have the lowest rate of poverty ever recorded for American seniors and for African-Americans. We've got the biggest drop in childhood poverty in 20 years. We're moving in the right direction. There are nearly 2 million fewer people on welfare than there were the day I became President of the United States, and I'm proud of that.

The family and medical leave law, which our opponents oppose, has given 12 million Americans a chance to take a little time off from work when a baby was born or a parent was sick or a spouse was sick without losing their jobs. We're a stronger country because of it. And I want—I want to expand that law in a modest way to say that folks ought to be able to take a little time off to take their kids to regular doctor's appointments or go to the school twice a year and see the teacher and see how their kids are doing.

Our veterans should not be punished through not being able to take care of their kids who were injured through their own service.', ""So we're moving in the right direction.

And for families that are taking care of family members with Alzheimer's, over a million and a half of them in America today, we'll give them a little respite care so they can keep their parents at home and still keep their families together and their sanity.

All over the world today American companies are creating jobs for Americans here at home helping other countries to avoid their environmental problems with new technologies.

It\'s the right thing to do. We\'re making progress. But we\'ve got more to do.', ""And let's just talk about that. We've got to first finish the job of putting 100,000 police on the street. Our opponents led the fight against it; then they tried twice to kill it. I say we ought to finish it. It's your decision. You want some help in Macon to deal with your gang problem? You've got to vote for our administration because we've got a plan to give it to you."", 'The other thing we ought to do is use the full power of the Federal prosecutors to go after these violent gangs with the same laws that we used to break the mob, the Mafia, years ago.', ""They should not take our children's future away from us, and we can't let them do it."", ""The third thing we ought to do is to remember that the best thing we can do is to save our kids in the first place and keep them out of trouble. I've worked hard to promote the safe and drug-free schools program, so that there would be a D.A.R.E. officer or somebody else that young kids can look up to in every grade school in America, telling these kids drugs are wrong, drugs are dangerous, drugs can kill you. Our opponents, they tried to cut it in half and take those services away from millions of kids. You have to decide. I think you want more people telling your kids to stay off drugs and keeping them out of trouble, not fewer. It's your decision. I think I know what you want."", ""This won't all be easy, folks. I asked this last week—I might get booed a little by the young people here, but I'm going to say this again: Even though youth drug use has gone up dramatically in the last 4 years, 90 percent of our kids are still drug-free. They're good children. They're not doing the wrong thing. They deserve to be protected."", ""But I'm going to ask those young people to make a sacrifice for their country and the kids who aren't drug-free. I'm going to ask every State in this country to make a drug test a part of driver's licensing so that we can identify the kids that are in trouble and save them before it's too late, get them out of trouble and save them. And I think the young people will accept the challenge to help their fellow boys and girls to have a better life."", ""But you have to decide. This is your decision. And we are going to build the best education system in the world for everybody. Today in Atlanta, I said something I want to say again. Forty percent—we all know education is the key to the future, but 40 percent of our 8year-olds still cannot read a book on their own. If you can't read, what good is it to have a computer? How can you learn anything?"", ""I have a proposal to take AmeriCorps volunteers and other trained reading tutors—30,000 of them—to go across this country and mobilize a million volunteers. The Congress finally appropriated our recommendation on work-study funds. We're going to have a couple of hundred thousand more college students drawing workstudy. And I'm going to try to dedicate 100,000 of those college students to teaching young children to read."", 'I want to be able to say—think about it— by the year 2000, we want every 8-year-old in America—every single 8-year-old—to be able to hold up a book and say, ""I can read this all by myself."" Will you help us do that? [Applause]', 'The second thing we want to do is to hook up every classroom and every library and every school in every community in America to the information superhighway by the year 2000— computers, educational software, trained teachers hooked up to the Internet and the World Wide Web.', ""Now, for all of you who are older like me and you're not just computer geniuses, let me tell you what that means in practical terms for your kids. It means that, for the first time in the history of this country ever, that children in the poorest inner-city and rural school districts, that children in the middle class school districts, that children in the wealthiest districts—public or private—for the first time ever will have immediate access to the same learning at the same level of quality in the same way as every other child in America. It has never happened before. Will you help us do that? [Applause]"", ""And lastly, we're going to follow Georgia's lead and Governor Miller's lead and open the doors of college to every American who needs to go—every American. We propose to give every student who will work hard and maintain decent grades access to 2 years of education after high school by simply letting you deduct, dollar for dollar, the cost of the typical community college tuition from your tax bill. That's our HOPE scholarship. Do right and you can have 2 years of college."", ""We propose to let every family save in an IRA and save and save and save, but to withdraw from that without any tax penalty if you're using that money to pay for college education or for medical costs or to buy a first-time home. And we propose to give families in this country a $10,000 tax deduction for the tuition in any kind of education after high school, anytime in America—for graduate school or undergraduate, of whatever age."", ""Now, that's what's at stake. That's what we're going to do for the next 4 years. And it's your decision. So I ask you to go out 11 days from now and vote your convictions about your future. And I ask you to talk to those who are not here and tell them that, if you stay home, you're voting too. You're making a decision. The idea that you don't make a decision as a citizen if you don't vote is not true; you do."", 'So just think about this beautiful day and look around this crowd. And let me leave you with this last thought. How long have we seen America divided by politicians at election time for their own benefit? How long have we seen people pitted against one another?', 'I will say again, the most important thing we have to remember is that we are all better off when we all have a chance—not a guarantee but a chance—to make the most of our Godgiven abilities. We are all better off. We are all better off when we help each other have the tools to build strong families and strong futures and strong communities.', 'So I say to you, I want you in 11 days— for Bill Clinton and Al Gore, for Max Cleland, for Jim Wiggins, for Sanford Bishop, for the people that are interested in building a bridge to the 21st century wide enough and strong enough to make sure our best days are still ahead—to go out there and help us build that bridge.', 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"
116,William J. Clinton ,"October 27, 1996","['The President. Thank you very much. Thank you. Well, ladies and gentlemen, Senator Robb called me about a week ago, and he said, ""You know, my father-in-law was the last Democrat to carry the State of Virginia. But I think if you\'ll come across the river and see us, you might be the next."" And here I am.', ""I want to thank Chuck Robb and his wonderful wife, Lynda, for being such great friends to Hillary and to me for, well, a long, long time now. I want to thank him for his courage, his character, and his integrity in serving the people of Virginia and setting a model for people all across America. I want to thank Congressman Jim Moran and Congressman Bobby Scott for the work they've done for you and for America, and I'm glad you're sending them back to the Congress to serve for 2 more years."", 'Thank you, Lieutenant Governor Don Beyer, for your leadership and for your future leadership for Virginia. Thank you, Senator Yvonne Miller. Thank you, Kate Hanley. Thank you, Sue Wrenn, and thank you, Ellen Malcolm. Thank you, Bruce Hornsby, for playing the national anthem and for always being there for us.', ""And I want to thank the Lee High School Band over here. Let's give them a hand, the high school band. [Applause] Thank you for being here. I'd also like to tell you today, since our campaign is about the 21st century, I brought with me the President's adviser on science and technology—a key to the 21st century—a seventh generation Virginian, Dr. Jack Gibbons. Thank you for coming with me, Jack."", 'Folks, on any day this would be a great crowd in Virginia. But on this beautiful fall day, when the Redskins are playing and on a streak and the Marine Corps Marathon is going on, this is an unbelievable crowd. Thank you for being here.', ""Of course, you know, ever since I saw that ad with Chuck Robb's body and Mark Warner's head, I thought maybe you showed up to see if some medical miracle had been developed. [Laughter] I didn't know there was anything wrong with Mark Warner's body or Chuck Robb's head until I saw that. I'm still trying to figure out what it's all about. I'll tell you one thing, I don't think it was about you and your interests and your future."", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. But Mark Warner is committed to you and your interests and your future. Mark Warner supports the Family and Medical Leave Act that's allowed 12 million families to take some time off when their babies were born or their family members were sick. He supports our efforts to put 100,000 police on the street and our violence against women program in the Department of Justice. He supports our targeted tax cuts to help people pay for a college education. He does not support the other party's agenda of abolishing the Department of Education. So I say to you, this election is about the future. It is not about the Democratic or Republican Party; it's about which vision is right for our future."", ""Thomas Jefferson was elected President as the first President of the 19th century. Three distinguished Virginians, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe, not only helped to found our country, they led us into a new century. Thomas Jefferson made the most important decision of my political life, a long time before I showed up; he bought the Louisiana territory. If he hadn't done it, I wouldn't be an American and I couldn't be here running today."", ""I say that to make this point. Believe me, when he bought the Louisiana territory for $15 million and more than doubled the land size of the United States—and by the way, that was the entire annual budget of the Government at the time. Can you imagine what you'd do to me if I tried to spend the annual budget of the Government on anything? [Laughter] And a lot of people thought he had lost his famous reason. He could not have foreseen the full implications of everything that would flow out of that decision. He could not have known that there would be all the things that happened in the 19th century, a great Civil War, two great World Wars and a depression in the 20th century, and that somewhere in a small town in that vast expanse of land that he bought, 150 years later some other young American would be born who would have a chance to grow up and be President. He did it because he had this vision of the future. And that's what I want to talk to you about today."", 'Just before I came over here, I met with a lot of cancer advocates, people who have worked on research and treatment and prevention, people who have worked especially on breast cancer. I announced $30 million in extra funding for breast cancer genetic research because we just discovered two of the genes that cause breast cancer. It may enable us to prevent it forever.', ""Now, let me just talk about some of the other things that have happened in the last 4 years. Because of research and faster approval of drugs, we have more than doubled the life expectancy of people with HIV and AIDS. It's on its way to becoming a chronic illness. We developed the first treatment for stroke ever. We have seen, for the first time ever, in laboratory animals whose spines were totally severed, movement in the lower limbs by the transfer of nerves from other parts of their bodies to the spine. This has enormous implications for military veterans, accident victims, and others who have been confined in their movements because of damage to their spines. We just signed a contract with IBM not very long ago to develop a supercomputer in the next couple of years that will do as many calculations in a second as you can do on a hand-held computer in 30,000 years."", ""Now, that is the world we're going into. I appreciate what Senator Robb said. We are better off than we were 4 years ago. We are moving in the right direction. But the issue is, where are we going? What is our philosophy?"", ""Again, I say, this is a period not all that unlike 200 years ago. It's not about party; it's about vision. Mark Warner, Chuck Robb, Bobby Scott, Jim Moran, Don Beyer, we share a vision about the things we must do together as a nation, in our States, in our communities to help each other make the most of our own lives, to seize those opportunities for the 21st century, and to move this country forward. That's the issue. Are we going to build a bridge to the future big enough and strong enough for us all to walk across? Are you willing to help? [Applause] Do we really believe we would be better off if their vision had prevailed for the last 4 years?"", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', 'The President. Would we be better off if there were no family and medical leave law?', 'Audience members. No-o-o!', 'The President. Would we be better off it we cut student loans instead of increasing them?', 'Audience members. No-o-o!', 'The President. Would we be better off if we cut Head Start instead of increasing it?', 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. Would we be better off it we hadn't made those 300,000 loans to women business owners?"", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. Of course not. Would we be better off if we hadn't cleaned up those toxic waste dumps—more in 3 years than they did in 12?"", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. This is not about party; it's about you, how we're going to live together and whether we should work together to give each other the tools to make the most of our future. Do you believe we'd be better off, as they say, if you were left on your own? Or do we believe it takes a village to raise our children and build a country and build a future? [Applause]"", ""In Virginia, the State with the longest and proudest and richest history of all in leading America in the right direction, the State which gave us the people who led us into a new century 2 years ago, your votes will decide whether we balance the budget and move away from the dangerous and reckless fiscal policies that quadrupled our debt in the 12 years before I came to Washington and whether we balance that budget in a way that keeps interest rates coming down and the economy growing but still protects the fundamentals of educational investment, research investment, protection of the environment, Medicaid's guarantee of health care to people with disabilities, to poor children, to seniors in nursing homes, and the integrity of the Medicare program, which has given us the longest living—the highest life expectancy for senior citizens of any country in the entire world. You have to decide."", ""You have to decide, now that we have passed the family and medical leave law, whether you agree with me that we ought to extend it a little bit so that parents can go to see their children's teachers twice a year without losing their jobs or take their family members to the doctor, whether people who work for overtime should have the decision in their hands about whether to take their overtime in cash or time with their families if their families need them at home."", ""You will decide about where we go in health care. We've now said you can't lose your health insurance just because you change jobs or someone in your family has been sick. We have said you cannot have an insurance company force a mother and a newborn baby out of a hospital in just 24 hours. We've said we're finally going to give some equal treatment to families with mental health problems. They deserve treatment, too. And after long, long years of advocacy by veterans like Chuck Robb, we have finally said to our veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam and whose children got spina bifida as a result, finally you're going to get the health care support—and the disability—you have deserved for so long."", 'Now you must decide. Their dangerous tax scheme would blow a hole in the deficit; require bigger cuts in medical programs, education, the environment, and research; and weaken our economy.', ""Our balanced budget goes further in health care. We want to give people help in keeping their health insurance for their families when they're between jobs. We want to make mammograms free for women over 65 on Medicare. And we want to say to the over 1 1/2 million families who are courageously caring for family members with Alzheimer's, you ought to have some respite care; you're saving the health care system money; you're keeping your families together; we know how tough it is, and we're going to help you. That's all in our balanced budget plan. You have to decide."", ""We have worked to reduce the welfare rolls by 1.9 million, while our friends on the other side were just talking about it, acting as if all you have to do is pass a law. Before there ever was a new welfare reform, we took the rolls down 1.9 million, moving people from welfare to work, working with 43 States. Now there is a new law. Here's what it says: The National Government will continue to guarantee to poor families health care and food for the children and more for child care than ever when someone moves from welfare to work. But every State and local communities now will have 2 years in which to turn, for an able-bodied person, a welfare check into a paycheck."", ""But that's just a law. Are we going to walk away now, or are we going to say, if we're going to require poor people with little children to go to work, we've got to make sure the work is out there? I have a plan to create those jobs; we have to decide whether we want them or not."", ""Compared to 4 years ago, we have taken unbelievable amounts of dangerous chemicals out of our air. We've lifted the quality of our drinking water. We've improved the safety of our food. We've cleaned up more toxic waste dumps in 3 years than they did in 12. We have worked to protect our precious national heritage and beat back their ill-advised plan to actually sell off some of our national parks. Now we have to decide whether we're going to go forward, continuing to clean up waterways that need to do it, continuing to uphold high environmental standards, and cleaning up 500 more of those toxic waste dumps so our children will be growing up next to parks, not poison. Let's don't turn back on environmental protection. Let's go forward and prove we can grow the economy and protect our environment."", 'Most of important of all, here in Virginia, where Thomas Jefferson first envisioned the need for free public school for all people, before others even thought most people should go to school, we are now on the threshold of an era in which what we earn depends on what we can learn, in which whether we can solve the medical problems of our time depends on what we can learn, in which our ability to preserve world peace and promote harmony depends in part on how much we can learn.', 'I want to give this country the finest educational system in the world when I leave office in the 21st century. I want us to have high standards, high accountability, and more freedom for principals, teachers, and parents to create those conditions in every school in America where those standards can be met. I want us to see a time when—different from now—today, 40 percent of our 8-year-olds still cannot read a book on their own. Part of it is because we\'re blessed by having so many 8-year-olds whose parents come from other places and whose first language is not English. But I have a plan to mobilize AmeriCorps volunteers and reading tutors, 30,000 of them, to go out and generate a million volunteers to help our parents and our schools teach every 8-year-old so that by the year 2000 every single third grader in America can pick up a book and say, ""I can read this all by myself."" You have to decide.', ""We have to create a world where for the first time all our children have access to the same quality education. And we can do it. If we can hook up every classroom and every library and every school in America to the Internet by the year 2000—for those of you who aren't great computer experts, what it means is that for the first time in the history of the country, kids in the smallest rural community in southwest Virginia, kids in the poorest innercity school districts will have access for the first time ever to the same quantity and quality of information in the same time in the same way as children in the richest districts in America do. It has never been done before. It is high time we did, and we're going to do it if you'll help us to stay with it."", ""And finally, you have to decide whether we are going to open the doors of college education to all. In the last 4 years, we've given 60,000 young people a chance to serve their communities in AmeriCorps and earn their way to college. Our friends on the other side opposed it. We have given 10 million young people the opportunity to get lower cost college loans and to pay those loans back now as a percentage of their income, so that no one can ever be bankrupted by borrowing the money to go to college. Our friends on the other side opposed it."", 'Now is the time to finish the job. And I want to do three simple things to help you, whatever your age—whatever your age—go on and get a college education.', ""Number one, I propose to let families save more for IRA's and withdraw from the money without penalty if they're using it to pay for education or buying a first home or dealing with medical costs."", 'Number two, I want 2 years of education after high school to become as universal in 4 years as a high school diploma is today. And we can do that—no bureaucracy, no program— simply say to people, we will let you deduct dollar for dollar from your tax bill the cost of a typical community college tuition. If you will go, work hard, make your grades, and be a good citizen you can go to community college—everybody, without regard to income.', 'And finally, in this State which has such a fabulous tradition of higher education, it is long since time that we gave our families a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year for the cost of any tuition at any institution of higher education, graduate or undergraduate. That is what I propose to do.', 'Now, that is what we are working for. What is their education vision? Abolish the Department of Education.', 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. No word about standards, no word about accountability, no word about empowerment of teachers and principals and parents, no word about teaching our children to read or hooking them up to the Internet or opening the doors to college for all. This is not about party. This is about people; this is about the future of America.', 'And I leave you with this thought. Thomas Jefferson said—and if you go to the Jefferson Memorial you see it inscribed there—""I tremble for my Nation, to think that God is just when I consider slavery."" We spent an enormous amount of our blood and time and effort getting over the racial discrimination that was at the core of our creation. We fought a Civil War to keep the country together. We went through a civil rights revolution to live up to the meaning of the Constitution. We had to amend the Constitution to do it. And we\'re still struggling with it.', 'But for the last 100 years—starting about 100 years ago, we have become increasingly a nation of greater racial and ethnic and religious diversity, so that now, in northern Virginia alone, there are more people from more countries, with more native languages and more different religions, than any of our Founders ever could have imagined. That means, however, that we have both the greatest challenge the modern world is facing today in our borders and the most fabulous opportunity.', 'Consider how much of your time I spend as President dealing with other people around the world who simply cannot get along because of their religious, their racial, their ethnic, or their tribal differences. Consider how many people there are in the Middle East, in Northern Ireland, in Burundi and Rwanda, in Bosnia, the bloodiest battleground of Europe since World War II, and countless other places who draw all their strength in life by saying, ""Well, whatever\'s wrong with me, thank God I\'m not them,"" who get up every day and think, ""My life has meaning because there\'s somebody who\'s different from me I can hate.""', ""And what has it led to in Bosnia? People killing other people's children. What has it led to in the Middle East, the home of the three great monotheistic religions in the world? On this Sunday, I called the leaders of the talks now going on in the Middle East and pleaded with them again to resolve their differences, to preserve what is a holy land for so many of us so that their children can grow up in peace and dignity and honor."", ""America's soldiers went to Rwanda and to Somalia to save hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people who should have been able to get along. America's soldiers are today in Bosnia, saving the lives of people who should have been able to get along."", 'On the other hand, if you look at how small the world is getting, and if you look at our base, our economic base, our resources, our capacity to produce, our educational system, our connections with the rest of the world, our diversity is a miracle of opportunity as we stand on the threshold of the 21st century.', 'And so I say again, as important as all those specific policies are, it\'s also important that we make up our mind that we\'re going to build that bridge to the 21st century together, we\'re going to walk across it together, we\'re going to say to each other, ""If you believe in the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, if you\'re willing to show up tomorrow and do your job or go to school and do what you\'re supposed to do, we don\'t need to know anything else about you. You\'re part of our America. We\'re going forward with you. We\'re going forward with you.""', 'So I ask you to decide. This election is not very far away. Most people in Virginia have been voting against members of my party for President for over three decades now. And I know how hard it is to break a habit. [Laughter] But one of the things we all teach our kids is that some habits have to be broken.', 'I want you to go out from this place and spend the next 9 days and tell your fellow Virginians they did a great thing for America when they and their native sons led us into the 19th century 200 years ago. And Virginia can help lead America into the 21st century 9 days from now.', 'Thank you, and God bless you.']"

Thank you for being here, Joan, and thank you for running."", 'I want to say a special word of thanks, too, to Congressman Bill Clay and Congressman Dick Gephardt, who are not here today but who are working their hearts out for victory in November and who have stood by you and for your future. And I want to thank my good friend Governor Mel Carnahan for his leadership for Missouri, his support for me. He will be a great Governor for the next 4 years. Thank you, Mel Carnahan.', ""I'd also like to acknowledge two people in the audience: Senator Tom Eagleton, thank you for being here, and former Lieutenant Governor Harriet Woods. And the people of Project Vote, thank you for being here. Thank you very much."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, I'm glad to be here in University City, a model of racial and religious diversity, a city with more than 24 churches and synagogues, a leader in equal opportunity and racial harmony since the 1960's, a stern rebuke to those who would divide our country today by race or ethnicity or religion. Thank you for the example you have set."", ""Folks, I like the cheering in elections. I even like it when our opponents show up and cheer. I like it when Americans are enthusiastic. It's what America is all about. But I also hope every one of you will take a little time in these last 8 days not only to cheer but to think and to ponder. This is the last election for President in the 20th century and the first election for President in the 21st century. I'm glad so many young people are here today because this is about your future in a new world, a new era, a new time."", 'So as we close this election season, I also want to take some time every day to focus on the big issues before us. Yesterday we talked about welfare reform. Today I want to talk about how we can keep our economy strong by balancing the budget and still investing in the priorities that matter to Americans.', 'You have to decide who can best lead America into the 21st century. You have to decide whether you want to build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past. You have to decide whether you want to build a bridge wide enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across together, or just say, ""There\'s the future; I hope you make it."" You have to decide whether we\'re better off being told we\'re on our own, or whether you believe it does take a village to raise our children and educate them and protect our country and build a good future.', ""Four years ago I ran for President with a simple vision, and I ask you to think about it tonight. When you go home, just take a little time and ask yourself, what do I want America to look like 4 years from now when we start that new century? What do I want America to look like when my children are my age? My answer is simple: I want an America where the American dream is alive and well for everybody who is responsible enough to work for it. I want an America still the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity. And I want an America relishing, respecting its diversity and coming together across its differences in shared values, not being driven apart as so many places in the world are today."", ""To achieve that America, I have worked hard on a strategy to expand opportunity for all, demand responsibility from all, and build an American community where everybody has a role to play and a place at the table. Four years ago when I came to you and told you this, you in Missouri, even here in the Show Me State, had to take me on faith. But today you don't have to do it anymore. Today there is a record, and we can show you. And that's why they're trying to shout us down, because we can show you. We can show you. So today, Missouri, you don't have to listen to the shouting, you can look at the showing. You can look at the showing."", 'We have more evidence today that our economy is on the right track. When I ran for President 4 years ago, no challenge loomed larger or seemed more difficult to solve than the deficit. The deficit had soared to $290 billion, a record high and growing. In the 12 years before I took office, our national debt had quadrupled over what it had accumulated for the 200 years before. We worked hard to change that. We passed a tough economic plan without a single, solitary vote on the other side. My opponent and others said we could never reduce the deficit. They said we would wreck the economy. They said these tough decisions would bring no good.', 'Well, we knew sooner or later there would be ""show me"" time. And we know now that for 4 years in a row, we have reduced the deficit. That\'s the first time a President has reduced the deficit in all 4 years of a term in the 20th century. We know now that our budget would be in surplus today if it weren\'t for the interest we pay on the debt run up in just the 12 years before I took office.', ""I pledged to you when I ran for President that we would restore fiscal discipline to our Government, cut the deficit in half in 4 years. I said it was wrong to leave our children a legacy of debt, and we would never get Missouri and America's economy growing again until we got the deficit down to get interest rates down, so that business loans, home mortgages, car payments, and student loan payments were going down. We had to get those interest rates down. The deficit was a ball and chain holding back our economy."", ""Well, today we've got some new good news about exactly how far the deficit has dropped since I took office. So, since the young people have the biggest stake in it, I want to ask two of your young people, Daraa Seward and Matthew Laudano, to join me, and we are going to officially announce, along with Frank Raines, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the 1996 deficit figure. You can listen to them and look at the figure, and you decide."", '[At this point, Daraa Seward, Gateway Institute of Technology student, and Matthew Laudano, Hazelwood Central High School student, unveiled the figures.]', ""The President. The last time they were in office, the deficit was $290 billion. The 1996 deficit has been cut to $107 billion. That's a reduction of 63 percent. That's the lowest level since 1981. But when you adjust for inflation, it is the lowest deficit in 22 years. Today, the United States has a deficit in its budget that— as a percentage of our income—that is lower than that of any other major industrial nation on the face of the Earth. This has meant real benefits to the people in this audience. It means cheaper auto, home, credit card, business loan rates, more business expansion, more job creation, a growing economy, providing opportunity again."", 'My friends, America has heard a lot of calls in the last several days. I would say that these results prove that America is awake and moving in the right direction to the 21st century. We are moving toward a balanced budget. We are going to continue building prosperity and creating jobs.', ""What has been the result of all of these efforts? Look at where we are now compared to where we were 4 years ago: 10 1/2 million new jobs in America; an unemployment rate of 3.9 percent in Missouri; median household income up $1,600 after inflation in just the last 2 years; the largest drop in child poverty in 20 years; the lowest rate of poverty among senior citizens ever recorded; the highest rate of homeownership in 15 years; the welfare rolls down by 1.9 million fewer people on welfare today than the day I became President; child support collections up 50 percent, $4 billion a year. And I might say in Missouri it's even better. Child support collections in Missouri are up 59 percent under Governor Carnahan. Thank you."", 'The crime rate has dropped for 4 years and is now at a 10-year low. Thank you. Here\'s a guy with a sign that says ""Cop for Clinton."" Thank you, sir. God bless you. We raised the minimum wage for 10 million families on October 1st. Twelve million families have taken advantage of the family and medical leave law to take a little time off from work when a baby is born or a family member is sick, and our economy is stronger because of it.', ""Twenty-five million families may get protection because we passed a law that says you can't lose your health insurance anymore just because you change jobs or somebody in your family's been sick. We passed a law to say that new mothers and their newborn babies cannot be forced by insurance companies out of the hospital in only 24 hours anymore."", 'We lowered the cost of student loans, had the biggest increase in Pell grants in 20 years, and gave students the option to pay off their loans as a percentage of their income, so no one should be deterred from borrowing the money to go to college.', ""We are moving in the right direction: more opportunity, more responsibility, a greater sense of community. But there is more to do, and your vote in this election will make a great difference. Your vote will decide, for example, whether we're going to keep this economy growing by bringing that 107 number down to zero, balancing the budget while continuing to invest in education and the environment, protecting our obligations through Medicare and through Medicaid to poor children, to the elderly in nursing homes, to families with members with disabilities, whether we continue to invest in technology and grow this economy for the future; or whether we adopt a $550 billion risky tax scheme that will actually raise taxes on 9 million working families, require bigger cuts in education, the environment, Medicare, and Medicaid than the ones I vetoed last year, and still blow up the deficit and weaken the economy and send that number going right up again. Your vote will decide. Are you going to help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", ""We have begun to pass health care reform. Your vote will decide whether we adopt our balanced budget plan which will give families help to keep their health insurance when they're between jobs, which will give free mammograms to women on Medicare, which will give help for respite care to the over 1 1/2 million American families that are out there caring for a family member with Alzheimer's, and still balance the budget. Your vote will decide whether we do that or continue to cut Medicare in ways that will allow it to wither on the vine and divide us in the future. Your vote will decide. Will you help us build the bridge to the 21st century with health care for all? [Applause]"", ""We have had 4 years of declining crime rates. We've funded nearly half of those 100,000 police in our crime bill. The Brady bill and the assault weapons ban didn't cost a single hunter a weapon, but 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers could not get handguns because of the Brady bill. And now the law says if you beat up your spouse or your child, you can't get a gun either. That's what the law says."", 'Now, your vote will decide whether we turn our back on that or whether we keep putting 100,000 police on the street; whether we take on the problem of violent teen gangs with the same vigilance we went after the mob; whether we give our kids something to say yes to by continuing to fund the safe and drug-free schools program and opportunities to keep children from getting in trouble in the first place; and whether we ban bullets whose only purpose is to pierce the bulletproof vests of police officers. Your vote will decide whether we do that.', ""On welfare reform, your vote will decide a very great deal. We have already moved 1.9 million people from welfare to work. We've passed the new welfare reform law, which says we will continue as a nation to guarantee to the poor medical care and food for the kids and more for child care than ever, if the parent goes to work, but now the State of Missouri and local communities will have 2 years to turn a welfare check into a paycheck."", ""It sounds great, but it's just a law. The question is, what are we going to do about it? Missouri has a program. Governor Carnahan has a plan—I have seen it working here—to bring in people in the private sector and offer them real incentives to bring people from welfare to work. I have a plan to add another million jobs from welfare to work. I have a plan to help cities like St. Louis make the extra steps that people with large welfare populations will have to do."", 'It is wrong to tell people they have to go to work and then not have a job there. I want to require people to work and have the jobs. And you will decide whether we are going to do that. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', 'Folks, under great assault by the present majority in Congress, we have continued to fight for our environment. When they tried to even float a scheme to sell a lot of our national parks, we said no. When they tried to cut back on environmental enforcement, we said no. When they tried to end our ability to enact new protections for our land, our water, our food, we said no.', 'We have instead taken more dangerous chemicals out of the air, moved to improve the purity of our drinking water, moved to raise the standards for our food. We have closed more toxic waste dumps in 3 1/2 years than the previous administrations did in 12.', ""But there is more to do. And I'll just give you one example. Ten million American children still live within 4 miles of a toxic waste site. If you'll give us 4 years, we'll clean up 500 more so our children will grow up next to parks, not poison. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'Most important of all, especially here, will you help us give the American people a worldclass system of education for every single young person in America? [Applause] We have worked hard to increase Head Start, to raise standards in our schools, to improve efforts at reform at the grassroots level. We have increased college scholarships and improved college loans and given 60,000 of our young people a chance to serve in AmeriCorps, the national service program, and earn their way through college.', ""But we must do more. And I just want to mention three things, very seriously, in this great center of learning. Number one, 40 percent of our 8-year-olds still cannot read on their own. Children cannot learn if they cannot read. Now, a lot of that is because we're a nation of immigrants again, the way we were 100 years ago, and English is not the first language. But that's not an excuse. That won't be much help to those young people when they're 15 and trying to learn algebra, trying to master the most sophisticated aspects of all the other science and math and other courses they have to take. I have a plan to mobilize 30,000 people, reading specialists, to get a million volunteers together to go out and solve this problem."", 'We just increased the number of work-study slots for college students by about 200,000. I want 100,000 of those work-study positions to be young college students teaching children to read, so that by the year 2000 every 8-yearold in this country can pick up a book and say, ""Now I can read this all by myself."" Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', ""We want to hook up every classroom and library in the country to the information superhighway, to the Internet, to the World Wide Web. What that means for all of you who don't have computers at home is that for the first time in history, in the next 4 years, for the first time in American history we can finally make available to every child in the poorest inner-city school districts, in the most remote districts in the high plains—every child in every school district, poor, middle class, or rich—the same information at the same level of quality in the same time in the same way. It has never happened before. Will you help us do it in just 4 more years? Will you help us do that? [Applause]"", 'And finally, will you help us open the doors of college education to every single American who wishes to go? [Applause] On the way out here this morning I passed the St. Louis Community College. We know now—we know that young people who want to get jobs with growing prospects in terms of income and security need at least 2 years of education after high school. I propose in 4 years to make 2 years of college as universal as a high school diploma is today, simply by saying to the American people, we will let you deduct from your tax bill, dollar for dollar, the typical cost of a community college tuition for 2 years. All you have to do is go and make your grades and work hard and be responsible, and you can do it.', 'I want to let more Americans save in an IRA and withdraw without tax penalty if the money is used for a college education, to buy a first home, or for medical expenses. And finally, I believe that families should be able to deduct up to $10,000 a year for the cost of any college tuition. We need to open the doors to college education. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', 'Do you understand what the choices are? Will you help us build a bridge wide enough and strong enough for all of us to go? [Applause]', 'We need you, Missouri. Thank you. God bless you. Bear down, 8 days. Thank you. Show them.']"
118,William J. Clinton ,"October 28, 1996","[""The President. Hello, Minnesota! Thank you. Thank you. Wow! Thank you. Let me say, first of all, with 8 days to go in this election, to come out here and see this shining sea of enthusiastic, exuberant faces, believing in our country and believing in our future, I'd rather hear your cheers than my words any day. You have made this the event it is. Thank you, thank you."", 'I want to thank the Members of Congress who are here, Congressmen Martin Sabo and Bruce Vento and Bill Luther. I thank Attorney General Skip Humphrey, who has been the chair of my campaign, for all he has done, but especially for being one of the first leaders to stand up and say it is time to stop the tobacco companies from advertising, marketing tobacco to our children. Thank you, Skip Humphrey.', 'I thank your State party chair, Mark Andrew, for his leadership. I want to thank the Sounds of Blackness. They were wonderful. Thank you.', ""I know that Minnesota is a great sports town, and we have two of your greatest athletes today here. I want to recognize them. Kevin Garnett from the Timberwolves, stand up. Thank you. Thank you, Kevin. And one of the greatest baseball players in modern history, who just got his 3,000th hit this season with the Minnesota Twins, Paul Molitor. Paul, stand up. Thank you. They're here because they want to make sure you vote on election day. Are you going to do it?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. I thank you, Mary Rieder, for being willing to run against what was done in the last Congress by Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole, and for being willing to run for the people of Minnesota. Will you help Mary Rieder serve you in the Congress in Minnesota? [Applause] I want to say a little more about that in a minute.', ""And I want to thank Paul Wellstone. You know, over the last 22 years, since I first ran for public office as a very young man—I can remember when I was a young man—[Laughter]—I have had the privilege to meet many people in public life, men and women of all backgrounds, races, all political philosophies. I have to say, even though it's not fashionable in the heat of a campaign, that most of the people I have met in both parties and from different philosophies loved our country, wanted to do the right thing, and were harder working and more honest than they ever got credit for. But if you were to ask me after 22 years, here on the verge of my last election, what is the most important characteristic a public official can have, day-in and day-out, year-in and yearout, I would say it's a good thing to be smart because there are complicated problems. It's a good thing if you're physically strong because it can be exhausting. And now more than ever you need a thick hide; that's a good thing. [Laughter] It's very important to have common sense, and it's important to be able to communicate what you feel to people so they can understand it. But the most important quality is the one that Paul Wellstone has in abundance, a great heart. It is most important to have a great heart."", ""You know, Hillary and I always love to come to Minnesota. I love being here. I thought about this State a lot over the years. Our daughter came here to summer camp to the Concordia Language Village for many years. So I had a chance to come here many times when I was completely anonymous, back when I still had a life. [Laughter] And I sort of conducted my own little sociological survey of this remarkable place. And I've noticed that Minnesotans are independent; they'll vote for Republicans, and they'll vote for Democrats. I've noticed that they don't like name-calling very much and that, historically, they've been quite progressive. And I've noticed also what I think is the most important characteristic in terms of the decisions we make about our future, which is that, historically at least, across party lines, in this State you've had a very strong sense of community, a sense that we have to do some things by working together, a sense that, as somebody that I know and care a lot about once said, it does take a village to raise our children and build our future."", ""And 8 days from this election, most of what I guess we need is a lot of your enthusiasm and energy and the kind of thing I've already heard today. But I hope you will stop and think, too, just a minute. I hope tonight before you go to bed you'll do something that I do, I try to do every day. I hope you'll ask yourself a simple question: This is the last election for President of the 20th century, the first election of the 21st century; what do you want your country to look like when we start that great new era in 4 years? What do you want your country to be like when your children are your age?"", 'For me, the answer is simple but profound: I want an America where the American dream of being able to live out your dreams is alive and well for every citizen who is responsible enough to work for it. I want an America that is still leading the world for peace and freedom and prosperity. And I want an America where, unlike so much of the rest of the world, we are coming together with our diversity, making ourselves stronger, where everybody has a place and a future in our America.', ""And that is the choice you face. For 4 years we have relentlessly pursued an aggressive strategy to create opportunity for all, to get more responsibility from all of our citizens, and to create an American community where everyone has a role to play and a place at the table. Four years ago when I came to Minnesota and the people supported Al Gore and Bill Clinton, you took us on faith; you couldn't have known. Well, now there is a record."", ""Today we have even more evidence that we're on the right track to the 21st century. Earlier today I announced the official figures for the deficit in 1996. When I took office, it was $290 billion; this year, it is $107 billion. My fellow Americans, 4 years ago I said if you gave us a chance we'd cut that deficit in half to get interest rates down and get the economy going again. It's been cut by 63 percent in 4 years. If you adjust the dollars for inflation, we have the lowest deficit in 22 years. It is a smaller percentage of our income than that of any other advanced economy in the entire world. And I want to say a special word of thanks to one of the chief engineers of the economic plan of 1993 which made it possible, Congressman Martin Sabo of Minnesota. Thank you, sir."", ""Now, there's been a lot of name-calling in these races up here. But you need to know when we brought the deficit down there was not a single member of the other party who voted for it. They said it would wreck the economy. They said it would bring us a recession. They said it would increase interest rates. They said the deficit would not go down."", 'Well, Paul Wellstone said, ""I think we ought to bring the deficit down and keep investing in the economy, keep investing in education, keep protecting the environment, keep protecting those who depend upon Medicare and Medicaid. But we still have to bring the deficit down."" That was the conservative thing to do: to protect our future, to conserve our people and our resources, and get our house in order. Senator Paul Wellstone said yes, and they said no. Don\'t forget that at election time. Don\'t forget that at election time.', ""I was reading some of the clips about Minnesota, where the unemployment rate has dropped to 3.8 or 3.7 or 3.6 percent, and I hear now there is a big problem with labor shortages in some places. Listen, folks, compared to 4 years ago, that is a high-class problem. Let's have more problems like that, labor shortage problems."", ""We have the lowest combined rates of unemployment, inflation, and home mortgages in 28 years. We've had the biggest drop in income inequality among working people in 27 years, the biggest drop in child poverty in 20 years, all-time record rates of exports and the formation of new businesses. That is the record. That is the direction we're going in. Homeownership is at a 15-year high. We are moving in the right direction; we need to stay on this track all the way to the 21st century."", 'We made every small business in America eligible for a tax cut when they invest more in their business. We made it easier for people to take out pensions when they work for small businesses and move from job to job. We made it easier for self-employed people to buy their own health insurance by giving them a bigger tax cut when they do so. We cut taxes for 15 million of the hardest pressed working people in America, and Paul Wellstone voted for that.', ""You should also know that we have reduced the welfare rolls by nearly 2 million starting in January of '93 through policies all of the folks in our party, including Senator Wellstone, supported—1.9 million fewer people on welfare, 1.9 million more people at work. The crime rate has gone down for 4 years in a row; it's at a 10-year low. Child support collections in America are up 50 percent compared to 4 years ago and almost 70 percent in Minnesota. We're moving in the right direction."", ""We raised the minimum wage for 10 million people. Twelve million people have taken advantage of the family and medical leave law that says you can have a little time off from work when a baby is born or a family member is sick. We are stronger because of that. Twentyfive million people now may be able to save their health insurance because we passed a law that says you can't have your insurance jerked just because you've moved from job to job or because someone in your family has been sick. And we passed another law that says mothers and their newborn babies cannot be forced out of the hospital within 24 hours. Thank you, Senator Wellstone. Thank you, Members of Congress."", ""Now, what you have to decide here in this election is not a matter of party. That's an unconventional thing for me to say with all my fellow Democrats up here and most of you presumably members of our party, but it is not. What you have to decide—what you have to decide is what vision, what ideas do you want to shape the direction our country takes as we go through this huge time of change. There is a dramatic change. You know it here in Minnesota. Here in the Twin Cities area you're on the cutting edge of so much change, but let me just tell you a couple of things to illustrate how much we're changing the way we work and live and relate to each other."", 'When I became President, there were 3 million people working at home on their computers, away from the office. Today there are over 12 million people doing that. Four years from now there will be 30 million people doing that. That will change everything in the way we work.', ""When I became President, most people thought HIV and AIDS was a death sentence. We have more than doubled the life expectancy of people with HIV and AIDS. We're on the verge of turning it into a chronic disease. The medical research we've invested in has given us the first treatment ever for strokes. Last year medical researchers in Government-funded research discovered two genes that cause breast cancer, and we may be able now not only to detect it early and avoid radical treatment but even to prevent it altogether. I announced 30 million more dollars for genetic research and breast cancer yesterday."", 'Many of you were moved when Christopher Reeve spoke at the Democratic Convention about the importance of medical research. And just about the time he spoke, for the first time ever a laboratory animal whose spine had been completely severed regained movement in its lower limbs by the transfer of nerves to the spine from other parts of the body. Think what that could mean. Think what that could mean— revolutionizing the potential of life in America. We are on the verge of an explosion of possibility, where more people than ever before will have a chance to live out their dreams. But you have to make the right decisions. Are we going to build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past?', 'Audience members. The future!', 'The President. Is that bridge going to be big enough for all of us to walk across together?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Are we going to tell some people, ""You\'re on your own, have a good time,"" or are we going to say, ""It does take a village""?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. That is the issue. When you see Mary Rieder up here talking, a person who has been a committed private citizen offering herself for Congress, you have to ask yourself, is this the vision I believe in, or was Speaker Gingrich right?', 'Audience members. No-o-o!', 'The President. This is not about party; this is about your life. They passed a budget which would have ended the guarantee of medical care to our poorest children, to our seniors in nursing homes, to families who can maintain middle class lifestyles and still care for family members with disabilities. They would have ended that. They would have given us the first real cuts in our education investments in modern history.', ""They would have paralyzed the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency to protect the quality of our environment. They would have allowed employers to raid their employees' pension funds, even to raise their own pay, if that's what they wanted."", 'And when I vetoed that budget, they shut the Government down and said, ""Oh, those Democrats, they love the Government so much they\'ll give us what we want just to get it open."" And I said, ""I\'d a lot rather see you hurt people for 3 months than 30 years. No, thank you very much. We are going to stand up.""', ""Now, these things have significance. This is not about the old-fashioned political debates: should this be done at the national and local level. This is really about how you think we're going forward into the future. That's what's at stake in Mary Rieder's race. And all these talks about, you know, liberal and conservative—let me just give you an example of some of the choices before us. This will happen; your vote will decide how this comes out."", ""Your vote in the Presidential race and in other races will decide whether now that we've cut the deficit from $209 billion to $107 billion, whether we go on and balance the budget and still protect Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment, and have targeted tax cuts that help people raise their children, have access to college, buy a first-time home, and pay for health insurance, all paid for already in our balanced budget plan; or whether we embrace this huge, $550 billion tax scheme which raises taxes on 9 million of our hardest working people, will blow a hole in the deficit, raise your interest rates, raise the cost of student loans, car payments, house payments, and business loans, and require bigger cuts than the ones I vetoed. That's the decision. Forget about party; ask yourself, do you want that for your future?"", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. Don't you think we ought to balance the budget and protect our values and our future?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. That's what Paul Wellstone voted to do, and that's what we'll do in the future. Your vote will decide. We passed the family and medical leave law. The leaders of the other party said it was a bad thing, it would hurt the economy. Twelve million families took advantage of it, and we have record numbers of new businesses. They were wrong."", ""Now, I want to expand the family leave law and say people ought to be able to get a little time off to go see their children's teacher twice a year and take their kids to regular doctor's appointments. And I believe when workers earn overtime—I'm going to tell you, everywhere I go, people tell me the biggest challenge they're facing in their lives if they're parents and workers is trying to balance the demand of being parents and workers. So I'd like to see us change the overtime law to give the worker the option when they run up overtime of taking the money for overtime or taking time with their children or sick parents or their sick spouses, if that's what they want to do. You will decide. You will decide."", 'You will decide whether we finish this work we are doing to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales, illegally, of tobacco to children. They are against it. Paul Wellstone is for it. You will decide in the Presidential race and in other races.', ""You will decide whether we continue to support the safe and drug-free schools program. Let me say this: There has been a lot of talk about the drug issue. This is a difficult thing for America now. We've had a big decline in drug use in America, a big decline overall, but drug use is still going up among people under 18. And we now know from surveys that somewhere around 1990 large numbers of young people decided it wasn't dangerous anymore, even though, if you take marijuana, all the medical studies now show that the toxicity of marijuana available today breaks up the concentration patterns of young people, can threaten the ability of young women to give birth to normal children, can undermine the whole future of people, not to mention what all the other drugs will do. It's a problem. We all have to do more."", ""We increased border patrols. We increased penalties on drug kingpins and others. And we put more people in the schools, early, to give the kids something to say yes to, those D.A.R.E. officers and others. They tried to cut the safe and drug-free schools program in half. That's their program for our kids—cut the safe and drug-free schools program in half. Paul Wellstone and I said, no thank you. We want more people out there trying to keep our kids out of trouble and giving them a future. And I think that's what you ought to support. I don't think it is conservative to want to cut the safe and drug-free schools program in half."", 'Look at the crime rate. The crime rate\'s gone down now for 4 years in a row. Is it still too high? You bet it is. But we know what works. All these folks up here in the Congress, they stood with me and helped me to pass the toughest crime bill in history. The leaders of the other party, they all fought it. And they went around and made a lot of hay in a lot of rural congressional districts, including in this part of our country, by telling people that ""the President and his party, they\'re trying to take your guns away from you. That\'s what the Brady bill is all about; that\'s what the assault weapons ban is all about.""', ""Well, they did that in '94, but now we know, we've got a record now. Two years later, not a single hunter in Minnesota has lost a rifle. But 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers did not get handguns because of the Brady bill. We were right, and they were wrong. They were wrong. And we just voted to extend the Brady bill to say if you beat up your spouse or your child, you can't get a gun either. And I think we were right again."", ""So now, when you think about the President or the Senator or Mary Rieder, you have to think about what's still out there. Let me tell you what's still out there. Are we going to finish the job of putting 100,000 police on the street, or shall we do it their way and walk away from it? Why would we abandon a strategy that is working, that is not only catching criminals but is preventing crime and giving our kids some role models in their neighborhoods and people to work with and something to say yes to? I think I know your answer. We need to build communities from the grassroots up, and we need to continue until we finish the job of putting these 100,000 police on the street and making all of our neighborhoods safe in America again. Will you help us? Will you help us? [Applause]"", ""The same thing is true in the environment. We fought, we fought, we fought, and finally we prevailed. And so we have taken millions of tons of poisonous chemicals out of our air. We've lifted the quality of drinking water and the safety of our foods, and we've closed more toxic waste sites in 3 years than the previous administrations did in 12. And we saved the parks from an ill-advised attempt to sell off some of our national parks. But we have a lot to do. Ten million children still live within 4 miles of toxic waste sites. If you give us a chance to move forward, we'll close 500 more and say our children are growing up next to parks, not poison. I want you to help us build that future. Will you do that? [Applause]"", 'But let me say this: Far and away the most important distinction between us, and far and away the most important decision you have to make in terms of how we\'ll be living 20 or 30 years from now involves education. You\'ve heard Mary talk about it. You heard Senator Wellstone talk about it. The truth is that even in a State like Minnesota, with a well-deserved reputation for having one of the finest educational systems in the world, we have to do better. We have to do better. The truth is that with our increasing diversity, 40 percent of our 8-year-olds still cannot read a book independently. And so I have proposed that we marshal 30,000 reading specialists and AmeriCorps volunteers and that we go out and ask for a million more volunteers. And let me say, in the budget I just signed we got 200,000 more positions in work-study for college students. And I want half of them to go to teaching kids to read because I know if we all work on it, by the year 2000 we can have a country where every 8-year-old in American can hold up a book and say, ""I can read this all by myself."" That\'s what I\'m trying to get done.', ""And I want us to build an America in the year 2000 where every classroom and every library and every school is hooked up to the information superhighway, to the Internet, to the World Wide Web. What is the significance of that? Well, here in the Twin Cities there are a lot of you in this audience today that know more about computers now than I'll ever know. But I know this: There are still people in isolated inner cities and in remote rural areas that do not have the educational opportunities they need and deserve, and they are not learning as much as they should, and the rest of us will pay for it unless we do better. If we hook up every classroom and every library to the information superhighway, for the very first time in the history of the United States all of our children in the rich, the middle class, and the poor districts will have access to the same information in the same way in the same time. It will revolutionize education, and we can do it together. We can do it together."", ""And the last thing I would say to you is, we must open the doors of college education to every single American of any age who needs to go. And in our balanced budget plan—in our balanced budget plan, paid for, every dime of it—are three proposals: One, more people can save in IRA's for years and years and then take the money out without any penalty if the money is being used to pay for a college education or health care or to buy a first home. Two, we want to make 2 years of education in a community college as universal in 4 years as a high school diploma is today. And here's how we're going to do it—no program, no bureaucracy—just simply to say we will give you a deduction, dollar for dollar. You can take, dollar for dollar, off your tax bill the cost of a typical community college tuition for 2 years if you will just go, make your grades, and do a good job. That will revolutionize opportunity in America. And finally, I believe we should offer a tax deduction every year of up to $10,000 a year for the cost of college tuition at any institution at any level. That will revolutionize American education."", 'Now, if we do these things, we will create an America in which everybody has a chance to live out their dreams. We will create an America that is still leading the world economically and politically and militarily for peace and prosperity and freedom.', 'And finally, and maybe most important, we have to commit ourselves not to falling prey to the demonic divisions that are hurting so many people elsewhere in the world. How much time have I spent as your President in the Middle East, in Northern Ireland, in Bosnia, sending troops to Rwanda to save hundreds of thousands of lives, where people are fighting all over the world because they\'re of different races, religions, tribes, creeds. How many people are there in the world who get up every day, and the only way they can get through the day is to say, ""Well, whatever you think about me, at least I\'m not them."" They look down on them.', 'How much hatred will we have to endure before we finally say, ""Enough""? That is what I have worked for in Bosnia, what I worked for in Haiti, what we\'re working for in the Middle East at this very moment. In America, that is why I\'ve fought those church burnings and the desecration of the synagogues and the Islamic centers. That is why.', ""Now, in Minnesota, I want you all to say this election is also about whether we're going to treat each other with respect, because I want to be able to say we're going to build this bridge, and it's going to walk across to the 21st century, to the era of greatest possibility ever known. And all I need to know about you is whether you believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, and whether you're willing to show up and do your job tomorrow. If you are, I don't want to know anything else about you. You're part of my America."", ""Let's join hands and walk into a bright new future. Will you help us build that bridge? Will you help us? Will you be there on Tuesday? [Applause]"", 'God bless you, Minnesota. Thank you. Thank you.']"
119,William J. Clinton ,"October 28, 1996","['The President. Thank you. Thank you so much. It is always, always good to be back in Chicago. Senator Moseley-Braun, thank you so much. And Mr. Mayor, thank you for your strong support, your friendship, and your very moving history lesson about the times when your father was here with President Kennedy. Maybe a week from tomorrow we can reclaim a lot of our great hopes and take them into the 21st century with pride and energy and vigor.', ""I want to thank Congressman Bobby Rush, Congresswoman Cardiss Collins, Congressman Bill Lipinski for being here. And I know that there are some other congressional candidates other than those that Dick Durbin mentioned: Clem Balanoff, my friend Danny Davis, and Rod Blagojevich. We're going to win that seat back to Congress. Thank you, Cook County Board President John Stroger, Assessor Tom Hynes, State Chair Gary LaPaille, our attorney general candidate, Dick Devine; thank you all for being here."", ""I want to thank Kevin Cronin, Koko Taylor, the Chicago Children's Choir, the Lennox Family, and Perfect Harmony, who sang for us tonight and performed. I also want you to know that in addition to Mayor Daley we have some other mayors here. It's nearly heresy to say there is another mayor besides Mayor Daley in Chicago, but we have here a very large number of mayors from all over the Midwest who have endorsed Al Gore and Bill Clinton for reelection today, including the great mayor of the city of Detroit, Dennis Archer, who is over here; Mayor Carty Finkbeiner of Toledo, who had a rally with 25,000 people for me late in Toledo one night, thank you; Mayor Gordon Bush from East St. Louis; Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton from Minneapolis; Mayor Kernan from South Bend, Indiana; and many others who are here. Thank you, all the mayors, for coming and for your support."", ""You know, on Saint Patrick's Day of 1992, the people of Illinois gave me a great victory in the Democratic primary for President and sent me on the way to a nomination and to ultimate victory in November, again led by the strong support of the people from Illinois and the strong support of the people from Chicago. One week from tomorrow, I want to ride home to victory for America on the shoulders of the people from Illinois one more time."", ""I want to say to you how glad I am tonight that so many of you in this audience are young. I thank the young people for coming tonight. And I want to say how grateful I am for all the various groups of people who are represented here: the labor people, the business people, the union leaders, the veterans' leaders, the Haitian-Americans, the Asian-Americans, the African-Americans, the Hispanic-Americans, the Irish-Americans, the Polish-Americans—all of us—and then all the rest of us like me, and whatever is left."", 'I say that because you will have to make two great decisions in that election a week from tomorrow. It is the last election of the 20th century and the first Presidential election of the 21st century, and you must decide whether in that election you believe our best days are before us, you believe as I do we are entering a great age of possibility, and you are determined to see us build a bridge to the future, not a bridge to the past.', ""And then you must decide, as you look around this great crowd tonight, whether we are going forward in that future together. How many times have we seen America be put back when we became divided against one another? But when all of these different people here show up in one crowd and join hands, with shared values, shared hopes, and shared dreams, respecting our differences and cherishing our common values, there is nothing that can stop America. We're going forward together into that 21st century."", ""You know, I remember so many things over the last 4 years, and I always get terribly nostalgic when I come to Chicago. But I want to say a few things about what's happened that affect you and your decision, that involve Dick Durbin."", ""You know, when I came here 4 years ago, even though Hillary was from Chicago, you sort of took me on faith. Well, now there is a record. Today we announced that the deficit, which was $290 billion when I took office, has dropped all 4 years for the first time in the 20th century and is now going to be $107 billion this year. Now, for you, for you that's meant lower interest rates. It means more investment and more jobs. It means lower car payments, lower home mortgage payments. It means lower college loan payments. That's what that means."", 'Now, when we were debating the economic plan in 1993, all of our friends on the other side, all of our friends on the other side voted against it. They said it would increase the deficit. They said it would wreck the economy. They said it was a terrible thing. Dick Durbin voted for it and provided the decisive vote. His courage has given us the economy we have today, and he deserves your vote for the United States Senate.', 'Audience members. Durbin! Durbin! Durbin!', ""The President. Not only that, this is about more than economics. The FBI reported last week that crime is at a 10-year low in America, that crime has gone down in each of the last 4 years. Now, we all know it's still too high, but it's moving in the right direction. And one reason is, our administration has formed a partnership with the city of Chicago, the other cities represented here. We're putting 100,000 more police on the street. We're taking assault weapons off the street. We passed the Brady bill. The Brady bill has kept 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers from getting handguns. And we just said if you beat up your spouse or your child, you can't buy a handgun either. That's what we did."", ""Now, the leaders of the other party, they fought us. The toughest crime bill in history with all the law enforcement organizations in the country behind it, and they wouldn't help. They fought us. They said we were going to take people's guns away, and they walked away from a historic opportunity to make our children, our streets, our neighborhoods, our schools, our homes safer."", ""But Dick Durbin didn't walk away. He stood up to bat and helped us hit it out of the park. And that's why the crime rate's down and why he has earned your support for the United States Senate for the future of Illinois. Will you help him? [Applause]"", 'Audience members. Durbin! Durbin! Durbin!', ""The President. Folks, you heard Senator Moseley-Braun and Congressman Durbin talking about the budget fight we had before. We did have a difficult budget fight. They did shut the Government down. They wanted to cut education on the verge of the 21st century. They wanted to paralyze our ability to protect the environment. They wanted to remove a 30-year guarantee of health care to poor families, to older people in nursing homes, to families who have members with disabilities. They wanted to take all of it away. We said no. They shut the Government down. We said no again. But the real reason it worked is that people like Dick Durbin were there to say we're going to uphold the President's veto. We're not going to let them divide our country and take us back."", ""So now you have the future out there. You have the future out there, and you have to decide. Are we going to balance the budget in a way that protects our investment in our future and our obligations to each other, or are we going to adopt their risky tax scheme that would blow a hole in the deficit, raise taxes on 9 million people, and bring back all those cuts again even more? We're going to do the right thing and balance the budget and build that bridge to the 21st century. That's what we're going to do."", ""Are we going to do the right thing and keep going until we put those 100,000 police on the street, help the cities take on the gangs, ban those bullets whose only purpose is to pierce the bulletproof vests of police officers? [Applause] Let's do the right thing and keep building that bridge to the 21st century."", ""Are we going to do the right thing and keep protecting our environment and clean up all those toxic waste dumps that are threatening our children's future? [Applause] Let's don't turn back. Let's build that bridge to the 21st century."", ""Are we going to do the right thing and help our families? Are we going to expand the family leave law so that parents can go to their children's parent conferences at the school and take their kids to the doctor? [Applause] I think we're going to do the right thing."", ""Are we going to do the right thing and open the doors of college education to all Americans? [Applause] We want to see all of our children learning in our schools. We want to see every 12-year-old able to hook up to the Internet. And we want to see every 18-year-old in America able to go to college. If you give us a chance, that's what we'll do."", ""Finally, are we going to do the right thing about going forward together? [Applause] Look around this crowd tonight, just look around. Look around. We've got all kinds of people here tonight. We even have some folks here for the other candidates tonight. You're welcome; we're glad to have you here. We're glad you're here. Look around."", 'Just think about this world we\'re moving into: the cold war in the background; no Russian missiles pointed at the children of the United States for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age. But what threatens us? Racial, ethnic, religious, tribal hatred; terrorism fueled by those hatreds. People all over the world who believe their life only has meaning if they can look down on someone else—""At least I\'m not in that racial group, that ethnic group, that religious group.""', 'Look at the Middle East and Northern Ireland and Bosnia and Rwanda and Burundi and Haiti, and all these places where the United States had tried to stand up for freedom and human dignity and peace. We dare not let that happen here. It should be thrilling to you that you can look around this crowd and see Americans from every continent. It should be thrilling to you that except for the Native Americans, we all come from someplace else, and we need to respect each other.', 'So I say to you, that future out there in the 21st century will be the greatest age of human possibility we have ever known. More of our children will have a chance to live out their dreams than any time in history if we make the right decisions. The decision we make a week from tomorrow will have a profound impact on how we go into that new century, on whether we say, ""We\'re going forward together"" or whether we say, ""You\'re on your own;"" on whether we say, ""I hope you can make it, but we\'re too busy to help,"" or whether we say, ""We do think it takes a village to raise our children and build our future, and we\'re going to do it.""', ""And so I say to you, probably no person in history who was not a child of Illinois has ever loved this State more or owed more to it than I do.

Four years ago when I came here, I came because I was worried about how you would go into the 21st century and because I had a vision for what America ought to be like at the dawn of that new era: a country with the American dream alive and well for everyone willing to work for it; a country still leading the world toward peace and freedom and prosperity; a country where we are coming together in the midst of all of our diversity, not being driven apart and divided as so many other countries in the world are.', 'I believe we are closer to that vision today than we were 4 years ago, and I ask you to stay on the right track to build our bridge to the 21st century.', ""Our strategy of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, an American community in which everyone has a place at the table and a role to play, is paying off. You heard Senator Glenn say we have 10 1/2 million new jobs; unemployment in Ohio has dropped a third to 4.6 percent. We've cut the deficit by 63 percent. We got the lowest combined rates of unemployment, inflation, and home mortgages in 28 years. We have the biggest drop in child poverty in 20 years. We have the highest rate of homeownership in 15 years. Household income is up $1,600. We have now dropping crime rates and dropping welfare rolls for 4 years in a row. We are moving in the right direction toward the 21st century, and I ask you to stay on that track."", 'We are also breaking the barriers that will unleash a future that we can only imagine and sometimes not even imagine. Many of you students in this audience will soon be doing jobs that have not been invented yet. Some of you will soon be doing jobs that have not been imagined yet.', 'Here at Ohio State and Ohio Tech and biotech centers and firms all across America, new discoveries are being made at breathtaking speed.

Now, let's go on."", ""You know, we heard a lot of talk from the other side about fiscal responsibility. And you heard Senator Glenn say that the deficit has gone down in all 4 years of this administration for the first time, he said, since President Truman. Actually, President Truman had to raise the deficit one year because of the war in Korea. This is the first time in the 20th century in all 4 years of a President's administration the deficit has gone down. And that's a good thing for America. It means lower interest rates, lower credit card rates, car payment rates, home mortgage payments. It's moving us in the right direction."", ""We're moving from a welfare system based on dependence to one based on independence. The welfare rolls are nearly 2 million smaller than they were 4 years ago—inconvenient for those who would shout down speakers, but it is—2 million. Now, this welfare reform bill gives us a chance to move people forever from welfare to work. But we still have to create jobs. If you're going to tell people you've got to go to work if you're able-bodied, there has to be work there for them to go to. So we have a plan for that."", ""We're making our families, our neighborhoods safer. We're putting 100,000 police on the street, taking drugs and guns and gangs off the street.

I tell all of you students here who have not started your families yet, one of the biggest challenges facing parents—I hear it everywhere I go—is how to balance the demands of work and the demands of parenting. Everywhere I go people talk about it. The family and medical leave law has allowed 12 million families to take some time off from work without losing their jobs. Senator Dole led the fight against the family leave law. That's why they're screaming now, and they're wrong, and they won't be screaming."", 'So you tell me, do you agree with the screamers who were against family and medical leave, or do you think America is better off that you can take a little time off when your baby is born or someone in your family has been sick?

You have to decide.', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. You know—remember what John Glenn said? I want a country in which every 8-year-old can read, in which every 12year-old can log on to the Internet, in which every 18-year-old can go to college. I would be screaming, too, if I wanted a country that took Head Start and Big Bird away from 5year-olds, school lunches away from 10-yearolds, summer jobs away from 15-year-olds, and college loans away from 20-year-olds. I might be screaming, too. We are not afraid of honest discussion and debate, so we don't have to shout our opponents down. But I might be screaming if I had that kind of record—either that or running and looking for a rock to hide behind."", ""We're having a good time here today, but this is serious business. Our ability to give every young person in this country the capacity to live up to his or her God-given abilities, without regard to their race, their income, their region, where they start out in life, is central to their ability, all of your abilities to build strong families, strong careers, and strong communities and central to America's ability to maintain its world leadership, not only in economic but in military and political terms, in the 21st century."", ""I'd like to talk to you just for a minute— you know what we have done—I want to talk about what we are going to do. First of all, we know that we have the best system of higher education in the world. We know that our schools are doing a great job with a lot of our students, but we also know that compared to many other countries, too many of our students are getting too far in schools without knowing what they need to know to compete and win in the global economy of the 21st century. So here's what I think should be done in the future and what I will work for."", 'Number one, as we have been trying to do for years, the States of this country must set high national standards based on international standards of excellence for students, for teachers, and for schools. The only way to get excellence in education for everyone is to define it, to expect it, to demand it, and then to measure it. I believe all children can learn. But we have to have high expectations, and people need to understand that 90 percent of what we need to know is not a function of IQ, it is a function of sustained effort, and we have to have it measured against high standards.', ""That's why I believe that students should pass to move from one level in school to another, and a diploma ought to mean something, and we ought to know that, we ought to measure it. But these standardized tests shouldn't be just measuring your test-taking ability; everybody should know on the front end what it is you need to know to meet world-class standards, and that is what should be tested. So you can have a lot of tests that don't mean anything. If we're going to have the tests, they must be tied to what is defined as an excellent education. That is what I favor, and everybody in every State is entitled to it."", ""Number two, we should continue to support grassroots reforms, as Secretary Riley has, to give parents and teachers and principals and students the capacity to achieve their highest level in every school in America. Every parent should have the freedom to choose their child's public school. Our balanced budget plan contains funds to create 3,000 new schools, charter schools, schools that are free to innovate, to demand high standards, schools that survive only if they produce results. The States already have money to begin that, and I urge them to do it."", 'But before parents can exercise the right sort of choice, they have to have enough information. So today again let me say, I challenge the States and the school districts of America to publish report cards on every school and to put them on the Internet. Parents should be able to compare class size, reading scores, safety records with all the schools in their district, all the schools in their State, and with schools across the country. We need to know how our schools are doing, and the schools should have a report card accessible to every parent in the United States, in every State and every community.', ""Number three, we should do, as Ted Strickland says—in our balanced budget plan we have a plan that will lower the interest rates on borrowing for school districts that are desperate to build cafeterias, new facilities, remodel facilities. There are almost 52 million children in school this year. This is the first year when there have been more children in our school systems across America than were there during the baby boom years—the first year. I have been to school after school after school where people are running out of the classrooms, where the conditions are broken down and the schools don't have the money to fix them, where beautiful old buildings are surrounded by trailers taking up the extra students. We have to do this together now."", 'Number four, we ought to work hard to make our schools, all our schools, places of values and learning, not violence. We have supported zero tolerance for guns in schools. We have encouraged schools to adopt school uniform policies. We have helped communities to enforce truancy laws and curfews. We fought hard to protect the safe and drug-free schools program from slashing cuts, because all of our children, early in life, need to see one of those D.A.R.E. officers or other role models up in their classrooms saying, ""These drugs can kill you. They\'re not just illegal. They\'re wrong. They can kill you."" We need to do that, and we should support it.', 'I have also challenged all of our schools to a broad national goal: Every child in America should be able to read independently by the third grade. Forty percent of our children still cannot do that. I want to send 30,000 reading specialists and national service corps, AmeriCorps volunteers around the country to form an army of one million people to make sure that by the year 2000 all of our third graders can read independently.', 'In the budget I signed last month, we increased the number of work-study jobs for college students by a third, by 200,000—that many more work-study slots. Now, I want to ask you something. I have recommended that at least 100,000 of those new work-study slots be allocated to young people who are willing to work to teach children to read. Would you help do that? Will you support that goal? Will you help us? [Applause] Think what it would mean for America if every 8-year-old in this country could hold up a book and say, ""I can read this all by myself."" We can do that.', ""The next thing we have to do is to hook up every classroom and library in America to the Internet by the year 2000. You know, 4 years ago nobody but nuclear physicists had ever heard of the Internet. Today even my cat, Socks, has his own web page. [Laughter] I'm amazed at that. I meet kids all the time, been talking to my cat on the Internet. [Laughter] It's an amazing thing. By the time a child born today is old enough to read, there will be 100 million people on the Internet. We must connect all of our classrooms and libraries to that information superhighway by the year 2000. Here in Ohio and 18 other States this past weekend, a NetDay was held in which business people, computer technicians, students, parents, teachers all worked to hook up their schools."", ""Now, let me tell you what this means. I have asked the Federal Communications Commission to authorize an E-rate, a rate that would say, all the schools and libraries in America will be able to hook up to the Internet for free. We've committed—actually, the Internet is even getting overload now, so we've committed another $100 million to creating a new, expanded, upgraded, next-generation Internet to handle all of you who want to get on it."", ""Now, if you're not a computer wizard, like me, let me explain in plain language what it means. If we can hook up all of our classrooms to the information superhighway, to the Internet, to the World Wide Web, what it means is, in those school districts Ted Strickland was talking about in southern Ohio, in the poorest inner-city school districts in America, in the most remote school districts in the far reaches of the high plains in America, for the first time ever they and the schools in all the richest districts and the middle class districts, for the first time ever, will have access to the same information in the same way at the same time. It will revolutionize educational opportunity in America, and we owe it to our children to do just that. And I hope you will support it."", 'And finally, I want you to help me in this election and afterward to open the doors of college education to all Americans. Everybody who wants to go who is willing to work should be able to go.', ""We have improved the student loan program. This direct loan program that Ohio State participates in has saved the average college student $200 and lots of time. But most important of all, it says you can pay your college loan back as a percentage of your income. So no student ever now needs to fear borrowing money to go to college for fear they'll go broke paying the loans off, because you can pay it back as a percentage of your income. It is a very important thing. Secondly, we've signed the biggest increase in Pell grants last month in 20 years. We did add 200,000 people to work-study. We've got almost 70,000 young people who have now earned money for college through AmeriCorps. But I want to do three more things and ask you to help me."", 'Number one, not everybody in America is or can go to a place like Ohio State, but almost every American of any age who needs further education is within driving distance of a good community college. I want to make 2 years of education after high school as universal as a high school diploma is today, and we can do it. We can do it. We can do it by simply saying you can deduct the cost of your tuition, dollar for dollar, from your tax bill, a HOPE scholarship in the form of a $1,500 tax credit. That will revolutionize education.', 'Number two, we should give every family a deduction of up to $10,000 a year for the cost of college tuition at any place of higher education, undergraduate or graduate, in the United States of America.', ""And number three, we should expand IRA's so that families can save in these individual retirement accounts and then withdraw from them without any tax penalty if the money is used to pay for college or buying a first-time home or dealing with a family medical cost. These things will allow us to say that middle income families will never, never be taxed on the money they save and spend for college. It will revolutionize the capacity of people to finance a college education in America."", 'Now, again I say I want you to think about what our country should look like in the 21st century. What is your vision for America then? What is your vision for America when your children are your age? That is what this whole thing is about. So as you go to the polls and as you debate this with your friends and neighbors over the next week and as you encourage a vigorous exchange, think about this, and think about this last point.', ""Look around this hall today. Look around this hall today. We have people of all kinds of different political views—[laughter]—and genders and ethnic backgrounds and religions and races. There is no place in America anymore where you can't find some measure of diversity."", 'I was in Detroit the other day, and I was told that in Wayne County there are people from 141 different racial and ethnic groups— 141 in one county in America. There are only 192 different national groups represented at the Olympics. Amazing. But you look at the rest of the world. Pick up the paper on any day, and you read about the Middle East or Bosnia or Northern Ireland or Rwanda or Burundi— all over the world, people literally torn apart by their differences. Why? Because there is something in human nature that makes people have to believe that they can only be important if they\'re looking down on someone else—""Well, whatever is wrong with me, at least I\'m not them.""', ""Now, we're trying to beat that rap. And that's why we cannot tolerate hatred or intolerance in this country. That's why America reacted so strongly against the horror of Oklahoma City. That's why America reacted so strongly against the church burnings and the desecration of synagogues and Islamic centers in America. That's why—we know that. We know that."", 'And let me tell you, for all of the other issues I\'ve talked about today, it is just as important for you to be able to say in your heart that you want to build a bridge to the 21st century big enough, wide enough, strong enough for everybody to walk across, and if someone stands up and says, ""I believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, and I\'m willing to show up and do my job at work or as a student or in some other way tomorrow. I\'m going to obey the law and be a responsible citizen,"" you need to be able to say back, ""I need to know nothing else about you. You\'re part of my America. I will join hands with you, and we will walk into the 21st century together.""', 'Thank you, Ohio. Thank you. God bless you. Be there with us next Tuesday.']"

Thank you, Congressman Chaka Fattah, for your eloquent introduction. What's all that music? [Laughter] Whoever turned it off, give them a hand. That's great. There are a few thousand people out there beyond the fence. Can you hear us back there? Welcome. We're glad to see you."", ""Thank you, Congressman Chaka Fattah, for your leadership. Thank you, Mayor Rendell, for your outstanding leadership of Philadelphia. It's amazing what you've accomplished for all of America, as you said in your introduction. [Laughter] Congressman Borski, Congressman Foglietta. And I'd like to introduce a person that I hope will be joining them in the United States Congress to fight for you and your future, Joe Hoeffel, a congressional candidate, very near here. Thank you, sir. Thank you, president of the Philadelphia City Council John Street. Thank you, my good friends Grover Washington, Patti LaBelle, Boyz 2 Men. Weren't they great?"", ""Thank you, Rodney Peete, for what you said and what you do, and we all wish you well in your recovery. He's in a line of work where he even takes more blows than I do, and he's doing very well. [Laughter] And thank you, Holly, for being here. Thank you, Dr. Papadakis, and thank you, Dr. Judith Roden. Thank you, Chairman Brady, and thank you, Catherine Baker Knowles. And I understand that there are students here from 21 different colleges and universities throughout the Delaware Valley, thank you, all of you, for coming here today."", 'Thank you, Secretary Riley, for being here with me and for being, I believe, the most outstanding Secretary of Education in the history of that department.', ""Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to elect the last President of the 20th century, the first President of the 21st century. You have a lot at stake in that election. I wanted to come here today where there would be so many young people to ask you to think about your tomorrows. I ask you to go home tonight and before you go to bed, to spend just a few moments asking yourself a simple question: What do I want my country to be like when we cross that bridge into the 21st century? What do I hope my country will be like when my children are my age?"", 'Here we are in Philadelphia, the birthplace of American democracy. When our forefathers gathered here to lead the way into the 19th century over 200 years ago, they restored to the Earth a form of government called democracy that had been all but forgotten for 2000 years. Since ancient Greece, people had given up on the idea that people could be free, could freely govern themselves, could elect their own leaders and make their own decisions and march into the future as equal children of God. It was a revolutionary idea.', 'And because they did that, they set in motion a whole chain of circumstances that have brought us all here today. All of us from our different ethnic and racial and religious backgrounds, all of us from our different economic circumstances, all of us from all over this great country and from all over the world, we stand here today freely to debate our opinions and discuss our visions, because they did that. What I want you to understand is that we are about to begin a new century and a new millennium where we are radically changing the way we work and live and relate to each other, where we must find a way to meet our challenges and seize our opportunities while preserving the values that have sustained this country and our families and our lives for over 200 years.', ""Many of you in this audience today will soon be doing jobs that have not been invented yet; many of you will even be doing work that has not been imagined yet. I want to say a special word of thanks to those who are here who are pushing the frontiers of knowledge, the hundreds of scientists and engineers, including many here in Pennsylvania, who have supported our goals in science and technology. And I want to thank especially one of your own who is here today and was a pioneer of the Internet and one of the cochairs of Scientists and Engineers for Clinton/Gore, Pennsylvania's own David Farber. Thank you for being here today."", 'If you just think about the Internet, 4 years ago when I took the oath of office as President, about the only people who knew about the Internet were nuclear physicists. Today, my cat has his own home page and own website. [Laughter] I stop and shake hands with schoolchildren; they know not very much about me, but they have been conversing with Socks on the Internet. [Laughter] Before you know it there will be 100 million people on the Internet.', 'So when we think about this election, I think it\'s good to cheer and shout, make a lot of noise and get our emotions running, but I also think you ought to take a little time just to ask yourself, ""What do I want this country to be like when we cross that bridge to a new century and a new millennium?""', ""I have always wanted America to go into this new century with the American dream alive and well for everyone responsible enough to work for it. I have always wanted to know that our country would still be the strongest force in the world for peace and freedom and prosperity. And I have always wanted to know that we could beat the tide of history driving so many people apart around the world, and we could say, we love our diversity, we relish our diversity, we're building a stronger American community with all the different people who come here who share our values and believe in our Constitution."", ""Now you know, 4 years ago when the people of Pennsylvania supported me, you sort of took me on faith. Today you don't have to do that entirely. There is a record. And it is true that we have 10 1/2 million more jobs; that we have the lowest deficit that our country has had, once you adjust for inflation, in 22 years; that our deficit is now the lowest of any advanced country in the world; and that in part because of that, we have lower interest rates, which means lower loan rates for businesses, lower car payment rates and student loan rates and home mortgage rates. That's what gives you 10 1/2 million new jobs and record numbers of new businesses."", ""We have seen, after years and years and years of decline and stagnation, the typical families' incomes begin to go up substantially again, the biggest drop in childhood poverty in 20 years. We have the largest number of businesses owned by women and minorities in the history of America. We are moving in the right direction to the 21st century."", ""The welfare rolls have dropped by nearly 2 million. The crime rate has gone down for 4 years in a row and is now at a 10-year low. Ten million Americans just got an increase in their minimum wage. Twenty-five million Americans may be helped by the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that says you can't lose your health insurance anymore just because you change jobs or somebody in your family has been sick. We've stopped and made it illegal for insurance companies to kick mothers and their newborn babies out of the hospital after 24 hours."", ""There are fewer chemical pollutants in the air. Our drinking water is safer. Our food standards have been raised. We've cleaned up more toxic waste sites in 3 years than the previous administrations did in 12. The environment is cleaner, and we have fought off the most vigorous assault on environmental protection since we began to protect the environment in 1970. We are moving in the right direction to the 21st century."", 'We have expanded Head Start, created the national service program, given our schools the tools they need to meet higher standards. We have lowered the cost of college loans and improved the repayment terms so that for 10 million American students today you can pay your college loan back as a percentage of your income and never fear being bankrupted because of the increase in the cost of college. I just signed the biggest increase in the Pell grant program in 20 years, and 200,000 more workstudy positions for college students throughout America. We are moving in the right direction.', 'But you have to decide. And I want to go through some of the specific issues, but I want you to keep the big issues in mind. The big issues are, what do you believe we have to do together as a people nationally? It\'s not the Government versus the people; our administration has reduced the size of Government, the number of regulations, the number of programs and privatized more Government operations than the last two administrations combined. That is not what it is. It\'s whether you believe we\'d be better off going into the future with the philosophy of ""you\'re on your own,"" or whether you think it does take a village to raise our children and invest in our future and move forward into the 21st century. It\'s whether you believe that it\'s enough for someone to say to you, ""Whatever your station in life, there is the future out there and there is a lot of mountains to climb and valleys to cross and rivers to ford; I hope you make it,"" or whether you want to build a bridge that\'s strong enough and wide enough for every one of us to walk across together. That is the question before you.', 'So will we balance the budget while we protect our investments in education, research, the environment, and our obligations to poor children, to our families in nursing homes, to people with disabilities through Medicare and Medicaid? Or will we adopt a risky tax scheme that will blow a hole in the deficit and require bigger cuts than those I vetoed last year when they shut the Government down? I think I know the answer to that. I think you want to balance the budget, keep the economy growing, and have targeted tax cuts for education and childrearing and health care and buying a first home. Will you help me build that bridge? [Applause]', ""We have made a beginning on health care reform, but our balanced budget plan will go further. It will help families keep their insurance when they're between jobs for 6 months. It will add another million children to the ranks of insured. It will give free mammograms to women on Medicare. And for the nearly 2 million families struggling to care with a family member with Alzheimer's, we're going to give them some respite care because they're trying to keep their families together. That's what we ought to do. Will you help us build that bridge? [Applause]"", ""We passed the family and medical leave law, which has given 12 million families a chance to take a little time off from work when a baby is born or a family member is sick. Our friends on the other side led the fight against family and medical leave. They said it would hurt the economy. We have 10 1/2 million more jobs and the fastest small business growth in American history; it does not hurt the economy when you help people succeed at home and at work. Parenting is our most important work, and we're better off."", ""I want to expand family and medical leave to say you can have a little time off without losing your job to go see your children's teacher twice a year and when someone in your family needs to go to the doctor, to take them. And I think when people earn overtime, they ought to have the right to decide whether to take the overtime in cash or time with their family if they're needed at home. Will you help us build that kind of future? [Applause]"", ""The crime rate has gone down for 4 years in a row because we listen to the police in this country and to community activists, because we passed a crime bill that had tougher punishment but also had prevention programs to give our children something to say yes to, is putting 100,000 police on the street and taking guns and drugs and gangs off the street. The Brady bill cost no Pennsylvania hunter a weapon, not a single one. But 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers didn't get handguns to terrorize the people here in Philadelphia as a result of it."", 'And now we have to go further and finish the job of putting those police on the street. You know, our friends on the other side, they still are trying to undermine our commitment to 100,000 police. It is bringing the crime rate down. I want to keep going until we have 8 years of declining crime and everybody in this country feels safe walking on the street outside their house with their children playing in the park down the street, feels safe in their schools, safe in their homes, safe in their neighborhoods. From the Violence Against Women Act, to the domestic violence prevention program, to the 100,000 police, we are moving in the right direction. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', 'There are still 10 million children in this country living within 4 miles of a toxic waste dump. I want to close 500 more so we can look every child in the face and say, ""Son or daughter, you\'re going to grow up next to a park, not poison."" In America, we know the environment can be enhanced as we grow the economy, and we will never turn back on that commitment. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', ""We've moved almost 2 million people from welfare to work and signed a new bill that says that people who are able-bodied have to turn their welfare check into a paycheck within 2 years. That sounds good, but passing a law does not change people's lives. I say if you require people to go to work, you had better make sure there is work for them to do. I have a plan to create those jobs, and I want you to help me build that bridge to the 21st century. Will you help us do that? [Applause]"", 'Most of all, my fellow Americans, your vote will decide whether we go forward together in our common quest to give every person in this country, from the smallest children to people way in their later years who need it, the opportunity to learn and to keep on learning for a lifetime and to do so at international standards of excellence.', ""We have worked hard to improve education, but we must do more. We have to raise standards, define them, expect them, and measure them and hold people accountable. We ought to do more. Forty percent of the 8-year-olds in this country—this is important—40 percent of the 8-year-olds in this country can still not read independently. That's partly because we have so many people coming to our country from other places and their first language isn't English. But they need to learn to read so they can grow and learn and someday show up at the University of Pennsylvania or Drexel and do well. That's when they need to learn."", 'Now, we have a plan to mobilize 30,000 AmeriCorps volunteers and other trained reading experts to go across the country to generate a million total volunteers to help teach children to read. Of the 200,000 extra work study slots we just got allocated to college students, I want 100,000 of those devoted to young people who say, ""Yes, if you will help me go through college, I will be glad to take some of my time to teach a young child to read."" Will you help us do that? Will you help us do that? [Applause]', 'We have to keep going with technology until we hook every school and library in the country up to the Internet, to the information superhighway. I want to do it for free—every classroom and every library. For the first time in history, if we do this, we can know, for the very first time since education began in America, that the students in the poorest inner-city schools, the students in the most remote mountain villages, along with the students in the wealthiest schools and the middle class schools, all of our kids together for the first time ever will have access to the same information in the same way at the same time. We are going to revolutionize learning in America if we do it. Will you help us do that? [Applause]', ""And finally, we are determined to open the doors of college education to all Americans by passing the HOPE scholarship, and saying, within 4 years we want 2 years of education after high school to be as universal as a high school diploma is today. And we'll help you do it. You can deduct dollar for dollar from your tax bill the cost of a typical community college tuition. Until everybody can go, we'll pay the way. All you have to do is work hard and make your grades, be responsible, and we'll give you the opportunity to build a new life. We want to give every college student, undergraduate or graduate in any form of higher education, a $10,000 tax deduction a year for the cost of any tuition. Will you help us do that? [Applause]"", ""We want to let families all over America save in IRA's for college and withdraw the money without tax penalty for education or homebuying or medical costs, so that we can say we will never tax the money being used for higher education in America because we want everyone to go. I want you to help us achieve that. We can do it with your help. Will you do it? [Applause]"", ""And finally, let me just say this: Look around this great sea of people today. You have people here who come from every continent, from many different racial and ethnic and religious groups. Here we are together as Americans. You have people here with different political opinions. I'm glad some of the opposition showed up today—reminds us we don't have everything."", 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. Now, wait a minute. No. Listen. That's what makes America America. If we all agreed, it wouldn't be nearly as interesting as it is, because we're all different."", ""But you think about the rest of the world— Congressman Fattah mentioned it—but you think about Bosnia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Burundi, South Africa; how many places in the world have people been torn apart because folks are driven by their hatreds rather than their hopes, because people define themselves in terms of who they aren't instead of who they are, because political leaders are always looking for a wedge to drive into the stake of the spirit of people instead of looking for ways to bring us together. We have beat that."", 'In the reaction we had to the terrible tragedy in Oklahoma City, we said, ""We don\'t hate people just because they work for our Government. They\'re our servants."" In the reaction we had to the terrible church burnings, to the desecrations of synagogues and the destruction of Islamic centers, we said, ""In America we believe in religious freedom and dignity.""', 'You look around this crowd today—that\'s the last thing I want to say—we have got to say, ""If you believe in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Bill of Rights birthed by our Founders here so many years ago, if you are willing to show up tomorrow and do the right thing, being a good student, going to work and doing your best, we don\'t need to know anything else about you.

I thank Stevie Wonder for so brilliantly taking us back across the years and bringing us back today again. He was magnificent, let's give him a hand.

You know, from ""The Usual Suspects"" to ""Seven"" to ""A Time To Kill,"" to Johnny Carson, to killing time creatively—[Laughter]—this man has a brilliant past and a more brilliant future. I am so honored that he was here tonight. We ought to give him a Purple Heart for how much time he had to stand up.', 'You know, I felt so sorry for Kevin up here. It reminded me of some of the licks that I have taken in this campaign. And one day when I was kind of feeling sorry for myself, somebody reminded me of something Mark Twain said and I wish I could have whispered to Kevin. The fellow said, ""You know, you ought to consider yourself like the dog Mark Twain talked about. He said, every dog needs a few fleas; it keeps him from worrying so much about being a dog."" [Laughter] And so no matter whatever happens to Kevin in his performing life, he\'ll always remember it will never be as bad as when he had to stand in Constitution Hall and make up jokes for 20 minutes during acts. You were great. Thank you, and God bless you.', ""You know, this election is in 7 days. It has always been about the future. The work that Al Gore and I have done for 4 years has been about building an America for the 21st century. Whatever else people say or talk about in the end, it's about the future of the young people in this grand old Constitution Hall tonight and all your counterparts all across our great country."", 'And so I ask you to give 7 more days of effort and your voice, your passion, your commitment to making sure that we roar into that next century together; that we build a bridge we can all walk across; that we say no to division, no to going back, no to the short-sighted, negative forces that would tend to divide us and cloud our clear vision of the tomorrow we can make together.

And I want to say a special word on behalf of Diana DeGette, who's trying to make sure that we have a different leadership in the House of Representatives and for the Congress."", ""I'd also like to say a word for our Senate nominee, Tom Strickland, who is, as you know, going to another one of his debates with Mr. Allard. And you have to be thinking about him. You're going to be enjoying a dinner, and he won't be able to eat. [Laughter] But I think he'll represent us well, and I hope you will help him prevail on election day."", ""Let me also say, if you have never heard Cleo Fields give a speech, when I finish you will have not heard the best speaker tonight on the platform. And I want to thank him. He comes from my neighboring State of Louisiana; I was elated when he was elected to Congress. I was downhearted when he was redistricted by a court. And I think he has a brilliant future ahead of him, and I'm glad he's here with you. Ron Brown would be glad he is here with you tonight."", 'I would like to talk a little history with you tonight, just to bring you to this point so soon, so near to our election. First, I thank you for naming these awards for Ron Brown and Barbara Jordan. They were both friends of mine and my relationship with each of them, though different, is something I will treasure all of my life.', 'I too remember the first time I ever heard Barbara Jordan speak, and I thought, maybe God is a woman after all. [Laughter] I always— I got to where I wanted to say ""yes, ma\'am"" before she ever opened her mouth, every time I was ever around her. [Laughter]', ""She never lost her love for this country, and the more her body became weakened by her condition, the stronger her heart and voice became. And in her last year she agreed to chair for me a commission looking at what we should do about the issues of immigration in our country, how we could remain a nation of immigrants and still take a strong stand that people who come here should do so legally. And she did it with a grace, a strength, a balance, a fundamental sense of fairness and common sense that everyone who worked with her marveled about. And that was her last great contribution to our Nation. And I've done my best to implement the ideas that Barbara Jordan advanced. And I'll always be grateful to her."", ""And all of you know, of course, of my relationship with Ron Brown. I doubt very seriously that I'd be standing here as President of the United States tonight if it hadn't been for Ron Brown. And so I'm going to keep him smiling from up there the next week. I'm going to do everything I can to keep that big smile on his face."", 'I also want to thank you for honoring Wellington and Wilma Webb. I not only like them very much, but I admire them very much. And Hillary and I identify with them. We love being around them. And I like seeing a strong first lady, and I like seeing a mayor who is strong enough to want to be married to a strong first lady—[laughter]—and I like that.', ""So I thank you for that. And let me say that Colorado has—I've been coming here a lot for the last 15 years, a long time before I ever thought I'd be here as President. I came every chance I could because it represented something very special to me. And I think you've been blessed by the quality of your leaders. Roy Romer I think is clearly, both in terms of accomplishment and intellect and vision of the future, the most gifted Governor in the United States in terms of his contribution to our future."", ""And he's like all of us aging warriors. He was reluctant to give up on his youth, so he broke his leg on a motorcycle and—[laughter]— he's left his cane, and he's kind of trading up his shoes gradually, you know. [Laughter] But I am delighted to be here with all of them."", ""This election we're going to have will elect the last President of the 20th century and the first President of the 21st century. Colorado sort of embodies both the promise and the struggles of the present and the future. And I was thinking when Mayor Webb was talking about Abraham Lincoln and the long talks we had about Lincoln when he was staying in the White House that the great thing about America is that there's always been a relentless quest for a better future in a way that would embrace the moment and, in doing so, not abandon our traditional values and ideals but instead try to perfect them."", ""A lot of people have this idea that, well, if you were really a future-oriented person, it means you're too material or you're too concerned about ideas, and that's very exciting, but you must be a little shy on the traditional ideals and values that have kept our country strong. But I don't see it that way at all. I think that our expanding abundance only gives us the opportunity which we then have to seize to live up more closely to our ideals and our values."", ""And this period that we're living in now involves such a remarkable change in the way people are living and working, relating to each other, the way we're relating to the rest of the world, that it has only basically one parallel in American history: 100 years ago—very interesting—when we moved from the farm to the factory, when we moved from the country to the city, when we then had our first big wave of immigrants coming in. And because we did not put aside our racial bigotry after the Civil War, even though we stayed together as a country and we abolished slavery legally and we adopted the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments and we began to move forward, we still were a country that said one thing and did another."", 'All of us are like that still, you know. [Laughter] Every one of us had a parent at one moment in a lapse said, ""Well, I still want you to do what I say, not what I do."" But what happened was, those immigrants, when they came in here 100 years ago, they felt terrible prejudice, the Italians, the Irish, the Poles. And then we had the Red Scare, and then we had the Ku Klux Klan rise up in America; no more than 50 years after the Civil War they were hanging black people again in the South where I grew up.', ""Because of the civil rights struggle and because of the progress which has been made, even though we're a long way from where we ought to be in the relationships between African-Americans and the white majority, we have a chance to deal with this new infusion of immigrants and all the new explosion of diversity of all kinds in our country in a different way than we did 100 years ago and to take advantage of all these technological and other changes to move closer to our ideals."", ""We also have a chance—it's very important to Coloradans—to take advantage of these new exploding economic opportunities in a way that preserves and indeed enhances our environment instead of undermining it, which is what happened 100 years ago."", ""So this is a time of enormous possibility. And it's very important that we not be distracted from the big issues here. There are two great, different philosophies at stake in this election. One of them basically says that the main thing about America is that everybody came over here to get a good letting-alone, and that's true. Our Constitution was constructed to limit the ability of Government to oppress people. But one of the things we've learned over the last 100 years is, in the world we're living in and in the world we're going to, as Wellington said, none of us get there by ourselves."", ""You know, I was thinking of Wellington's story—I was raised by—I was born to a widowed mother, and my stepfather didn't graduate from high school. And it's inconceivable, I think, to a lot of my kinfolks at home that I ever turned out to be President. [Laughter] But I know one thing: If I had been born black instead of white, I wouldn't be President. I know that. But I know we're closer to the time when anybody can run for President, fulfilling the Constitution's requirements, and be considered on his or her own merits. We're closer."", ""And so I still believe that the Government in many areas of private life—choice, religion, many other areas—should let people, as long as they're not hurting other people, make their own decisions and go forward. One of the proudest moments of my Presidency was signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. And most of you probably don't even know I signed it because there was no fight about, and if there's not a fight in Washington, it doesn't get on the news in Denver. [Laughter] It passed unanimously. And then we have vigorously enforced it, including in a controversial case out here in Colorado where—every case I have bent over backwards to make sure that we never interfere with any person's exercise of his or her religious convictions, whatever they are, unless it's really going to threaten to bring the Government down or something terrible."", ""And so, here we are at this moment, and I think what we've learned is, yes, we should guarantee, first and foremost, the individual liberty of people; but to guarantee their security and to give them all the same chance—not a guarantee but a chance in life—there are some things we have to do together. And it is the difference of opinion over how much we should do together and what we should do together that this election is all about."", ""It is not about big Government. Our administration has reduced the size of Government, the number of regulations, the number of Government programs eliminated, and we have privatized more Government operations than the previous two Republican administrations combined. If they had this record, they would be saying it's the greatest thing since sliced bread."", 'But what I have not been willing to do is to see us walk away from our common obligations to give all of our people educational opportunities; to give health care to poor children, to families with disabilities, to the elderly in nursing homes; to preserve the gains of Medicare, even as we reform the system; and to protect the environment and to continue our investment in research and in technology in our endless quest to move into the future so more people can live closer to what we all say we believe.', 'That\'s what this election is about, whether you think we\'re better off being told, ""You\'re on your own, and we hope you make it,"" or whether we think it does take a village to raise our children and build a country. That\'s what this election is about.', 'It\'s about whether we\'re going to build a bridge to the 21st century that\'s big enough and wide enough for all of us to walk across, and then whether we\'re going to have in our hearts the capacity to say, ""If you believe in the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and the Constitution and you\'re willing to show up for work tomorrow—or, if you\'re of that age, to show up for school tomorrow— if you\'re willing to do your job as an American, we don\'t need to know anything else about you, nothing. Nothing else matters. You\'re part of our America, and we\'re willing to walk hand in hand with you across that bridge into the future.""', ""Now, that is what the election is about. I was reading today an amusing—I thought it was amusing—an article in a magazine about my judicial appointments, because they pointed out that one of the things that has not been discussed much in the election is the fact that the next President may well get to make a couple more appointments to the Supreme Court. And they were saying that the previous administration imposed—two administrations—imposed strict ideological litmus tests on a lot of judges and that a lot of my supporters were disappointed that I didn't turn around and do exactly the same thing on the other end, but instead I had insisted on two things, excellence and diversity."", ""And they pointed out that I had appointed more African-Americans, more Hispanics, more Asian-Americans, and more women to the Federal bench than any President in history and that, in spite of that, we had the highest ratings from the American Bar Association for excellence of any judicial selections in the history of the country since they've been doing that."", ""I think if you have a Federal bench that reflects the vast experiences of America, with people that are smart enough to figure out the issues that are put before them and they share the experiences of America in all of its permutations, chances are pretty good that they'll do what they ought to do. And judges aren't like Presidents or Congressmen, but they should reflect America."", ""I say all that to make this point. Every election time the election is always decided by those who vote and by those who don't. And the people that have the biggest stake in whether we build a bridge that we can all walk across together—in whether we adopt my education agenda, which is to expand Head Start; to teach every 8-year-old to read a book independently; to have every classroom in the country, even in the poorest school districts, in the most remote rural districts, hooked up to the information superhighway by the year 2000; to make 2 years of college as universal as high school is today by giving people a tax credit, a dollarfor-dollar reduction on their tax bill of up to $1,500 a year, the cost of a typical community college education; to give every family a tax deduction of up to $10,000 for any college tuition, undergraduate or graduate, for people of any age; to let families save in an IRA and withdraw from it tax-free if the money is used for education or buying a first home or a medical emergency—that agenda, if you embrace that, it means that you think we have a common obligation to help each other live up to the fullest of our abilities and that we'll all be better off if we all have a chance to do well."", ""If you support my agenda—that I think we have a common obligation to eliminate discrimination of all kinds in the workplace; to protect the environment; to continue to try to expand coverage of health care step by step to people, so that people who work have a chance to buy health care—you have to believe that it's because we're all going to be better off if we live closer to what we say we believe and we give everybody else a chance to do the same. That's what the election is about."", 'And the people that have the most at stake are the ones that will have the best excuse not to vote. How many mothers do we know out there raising two or three kids, working two jobs, having to figure out, ""I\'ve got to figure out how to vote on a workday, and I\'ve got to get my kids somewhere before I go to work, and what\'s going to happen to them after school, and I don\'t have enough money for child care, and what have I got to do tonight?"" All the people that may have the biggest stake in this election may have the best excuse—not a reason but it\'s a pretty good excuse—because their lives will be crowded with other things.', ""And maybe they have or haven't felt it, but it makes a difference. Ten million more Americans got an increase in the minimum wage. The average income is up $1,600 for the typical family in the last 2 years after 20 years of wage stagnation. Last month we found out—or just 2 weeks ago we found out that we had the biggest decline in income inequality among working people in 27 years, since this administration came in; the biggest drop in childhood poverty in 20 years; the biggest drop in poverty in female-headed households in 30 years; the lowest recorded poverty levels ever for senior citizens and African-Americans; the largest number of new businesses owned by minorities and women in the history of the country; the largest number of new small businesses owned by anybody in the history of the country. It makes a difference. It makes a difference."", ""So it makes a difference what policies we pursue, and it will change people's lives here. And so I ask you to go out and help our Senate candidate, help Diana DeGette, help Bill Clinton and Al Gore, not as a matter of party, now, but because it has fallen to our party to embrace a philosophy that the other party embraced briefly under Abraham Lincoln, that they embraced briefly under Theodore Roosevelt, but that they have abandoned. And so it has fallen to us to carry this banner, not as a matter of party but as a matter of carrying on the great American experiment in a way that will truly realize the era of greatest possibility ever known."", ""I honestly believe these kids here in this audience, they'll be doing things in 10 or 15 years we couldn't even dream of. They'll be doing jobs that haven't been invented; some of them will be doing jobs that haven't been imagined. It's all out there. But we have to make the right decisions. And as much as anything else, that's why I have fought so hard not only to make the right governmental decisions but to say the right things as your President when the hatred of the Government led a demented person to blow up a Federal building in Oklahoma City—allegedly; they haven't been tried yet, and we can't presume anybody's guilt. But we know that Government hatred has led people into bands of folks that are paranoid that terrible things are going to happen to them. I had to speak against that."", ""When the black churches are being burned or white churches are being burned or synagogues are being defaced or Islamic centers are being defaced, that's not our America. But that is the dominant theme of life that caused people to slaughter each other's children in Bosnia. And it still bedevils Northern Ireland; they're still arguing over things—they're my ancestors, you know, and they're my relatives now, so I can talk about them. They're still fighting over things that happened 300 years ago and battles that occurred 600 years ago, when all the kids want to do is to let it go and go on into the future. In the Middle East, where I have worked so hard, the Holy Land for the three great monotheistic religions in the world—if anyplace in the world ought to be a peaceful sanctuary for Jews and Muslims and Christians, it ought to be the Holy Land. But so many of them just can't let it go."", ""And we're going to beat all that if we do the right things. When Hillary and Chelsea and I went to open the Olympics and I looked at those people—we had people from 197 different racial and ethnic groups. Almost every single one of them had people in America. And that's because we're not about race or religion or anything else. We're about these ideas and trying every, every, every age to live up closer to them."", 'This is a very historic election, not because of me but because of what\'s happening to us. And we go through periods of huge change like this only rarely. And that\'s a good thing, because nobody can change—you know, any of us can just stand so much change at once. One of my laws of politics: We\'re all for change in general, but we\'re against it in particular. [Laughter] Or as one of my friends said, ""Yes, I agree with you, we ought to change. You go first."" [Laughter]', ""So this is our responsibility. Now, you know what to do, and you know how to do it. And if Ron Brown were here giving a speech tonight, that's all he'd be talking about. That's all he'd be talking about. And Barbara Jordan, if she were here, she'd make you feel so guilty you wouldn't sleep between now and Tuesday— [laughter]—until you dragged every human being you knew to the polls. Now, you know that."", 'So I want you to think about that. And I want you to understand that you carry with you the great burden and opportunity of American history. Every one of us should be grateful to be alive at this time, should be grateful to have this moment in which we have a chance to further break down the walls of discrimination in our minds and hearts, explode opportunity for all Americans, and that these changes that are going on give us this incredible opportunity to really actually enhance the natural environment God has given us and leave it stronger and better for our children and grandchildren, even as we prosper.', ""That's what I want you to think about. I want you to think about, Tuesday morning when you get up, that bridge to tomorrow, and how you wouldn't let your child have to go down deep valleys and cross rushing rivers and climb big mountains if they could just get on a bridge and walk straight across. And that's what I want for everybody. And in order to do it, we've got to show up. You know what to do. You know how to do it. Your country needs you. I know you'll be there."", 'Thank you, and God bless you.']"

And I always felt that Colorado represented all the cauldron of things that are happening in America a little bit ahead of time, that you were on the cutting edge of the future, that you were embracing the future, but that you were also dealing with the conflicts that bedevil us all and that threaten to divide us and take us back.', ""I always felt that here people had a good old-fashioned conservative sense that there were some things the Government ought not to do and mess with, and that that gave some of our opponents on the other side an unusual and often unfair advantage in the rhetoric of these elections.

I want us to go into that next century 4 years from now with the American dream alive and well for every person who's responsible to work for it."", ""I want us to continue to lead the world for peace and freedom and prosperity.

Thank you."", 'Now, we\'ve had a lot of fun tonight, but this is really serious. This election, here\'s what\'s at stake. All these debates and these fights over the budget and the environment and all this stuff, it comes down to two big ideas: Do you believe that we should go into this new century, with all these dramatic changes, by doing what they believe when they\'re talking in a sound voice and saying, ""You\'re on you\'re own""? Or do you believe that, as a person I\'m reasonably close to once said, it takes a village to raise our children and to go forward? That\'s the issue.', 'Do you believe that we should say, ""There\'s the future out there. Now, there\'s a big running river between here and there, and there\'s a deep valley, and there\'s a huge mountain, and I hope you get there""? Or would you like to build a big, wide bridge that we can all walk across together? That\'s what this is about. That\'s what this is about.', ""And all the specific issues, if you think about that, that's what it's about. It is not about big, oppressive Government. Our administration, under the leadership of Vice President Gore, has reduced the size of the Government to its smallest point since John Kennedy was President. We have eliminated more Government regulations and more Government programs, and we've privatized more Government operations that belong in the private sector than my two Republican predecessors did put together. It is not about that."", ""But what we believe is that there are some things we should do together. I think this is a better country because we've got hundreds of thousands more children in Head Start. I think this is a better country because we work with Roy Romer and other Governors to give States the ability to set high standards and to promote reforms like that charter school right there that—they've got a sign up."", ""I think this is a better country because we had the biggest increase in Pell grants in 20 years and because we lowered the cost of college loans and improved the repayment terms. I believe it's a better country. I believe we're a better country because we set aside 1.7 million acres in southern Utah for the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. I believe it's a better country."", ""I believe it's a better country because we passed the family and medical leave law and 12 million people got to take some time off from work when a baby was born or a family member was sick. I believe it's a better country because we passed a crime bill, and we're putting 100,000 more police on the street. I believe it's a better country."", ""I believe it's a better country because we've doubled the number of children who are getting the message from D.A.R.E. officers and others, through the safe and drug-free schools program, that drugs can kill you and they're wrong and you should stay away from them. I think it's a better country because we did that."", ""And you have to decide whether you don't believe we should have joined together as a people and done those things together and whether you believe the ideas we have for the future are right or wrong. But it all comes down to whether you think we're all in this together, we're better off, each of us individually and our families and our communities, when we work together to help everybody have the tools to make the most of their own lives and live up to their God-given potential. That is the great issue in this election. That is the great issue in this election."", ""You have some evidence about which works. We've got 10 1/2 million more jobs, the biggest decline in inequality among working families in 27 years, the biggest drop in child poverty in 20 years, record numbers of new small businesses in every year, record numbers of new businesses owned by women and minorities in the history of America. You have some evidence. We have record exports. The welfare rolls have declined by 1.9 million. The crime rate has gone down for 4 years in a row; it's at a 10-year low in the United States. It's not like there's no evidence. You have evidence now. This country is on the right track to the 21st century, and we need to keep going."", ""When I told you before that it's not a matter of party, I meant it. There was a time, under Abraham Lincoln, when the Republican Party believed that we had to go forward together and we couldn't live with the lie of slavery anymore. It was a lie. It defied all the values of the Constitution. There was a time when the Republican Party, under Theodore Roosevelt, believed that we could not become a great industrial nation and forget about the importance of protecting small business and working people through free enterprise and maintaining competition and protecting innocent children from being forced to work 70 hours a week in coal mines and in beginning the work of conserving our great natural resources with the Grand Canyon and other things that Theodore Roosevelt did. This does not have to be a matter of party."", ""But if you look at what they did when their philosophy controlled—what Mr. Allard did, Tom Strickland's opponent, and Mr. Gingrich did and my opponent did—they passed a budget that had the first education cuts in modern history. They cut college loans and cut Head Start. They passed a budget that would have paralyzed our ability to protect the environment and to enforce the environmental laws. They passed a budget that would have for the first time in 30 years taken away the guarantee of health care to our poorest children, to middle class families that have family members with disabilities—but because they get a little help they can go on being middle class families and support themselves and their loved ones in dignity. They would have repealed the standards on quality nursing home care as oppressive Government. That was their idea of being conservative. That was their idea."", ""They opposed the crime bill. They said we were going to take people's guns away from them in Colorado. Folks, they didn't know then, but we've got 2 years now; we know who was telling the truth. There's not a single Colorado hunter that's lost a rifle, but 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers have not gotten handguns because of the Brady bill. We know what happened."", ""So I don't want you—I don't vote here. I can't stand up here and ask you to vote for Tom Strickland because he's a Democrat. But I can do this: I can tell you that he believes, as I do, that we have an obligation to bring our people together and to move forward together. You heard what Diana DeGette said when she was up here speaking. I know Bill Ritter has supported our anticrime strategy and so has Wellington Webb, and that's why you've had some of the success you've had here. And this is not so much about liberal or conservative or Republican or Democrat. It's whether you believe that there are some things that we must do together if we want the 21st century to be the greatest age of possibility in human history."", 'I loved it when Wellington said a few minutes ago that he was talking to some of his friends and supporters and he said, ""I didn\'t get there alone, you put me there."" And he mentioned that old rural saying that I was raised with, ""If you see a frog on a fence post, chances are it didn\'t get there by accident."" [Laughter] You know, I\'ve heard all these people get up here and run for office and talk about how much they\'ve achieved through their own effort. And most of us who run for office would like you to believe we were born in a log cabin we built ourselves. [Laughter] But the truth is, success in life requires both individual effort and responsibility and a loving family, a loving community, a supportive nation, people trying to help each other to move forward together, and we\'re all stronger when we do that. And that\'s what this is about.', ""And that's what it's about for the next 4 years. When you go home tonight, every one of you, especially the young people, I want you to ask yourself this question before you turn in. Just ask yourself and see if you can answer in a minute or two, what do I want my country to be like when we cross that bridge into the 21st century? What do I want my country to be like when I have children and they are my age? What do I want them to feel about America? What do I want the feel of America to be? What do I want the position of my country in the world to be?"", ""If you ask the right question, and if America asks the right question on Tuesday, we'll get the right answer. The only way we won't get it is if we don't ask the right question."", ""Now, I want to build a bridge to the 21st century where we go on and balance the budget, because if we get interest rates down we'll have more jobs, more incomes, and more opportunities.

And I want you to help me build that bridge. Will you do that? [Applause]"", ""I like the family and medical leave law, and I think we should be doing more to help people succeed at home and at work. I can tell you young people who are here who don't have kids yet, the single thing I hear most from parents all over America is—whether they're low-income working people, middle class people, or even people with comfortable incomes—is they're spending more hours at work than ever before, and they are worried that they won't be able to succeed at their most important job—I was so glad to hear Katherine say that—their most important job, raising their kids, and succeed at work. We can't make Americans make that choice. We have to be able to do both."", ""So I like the family and medical leave law, and I want to expand it. I want to say you can take a little time off from work to go see your children's teachers twice a year and take your kids to the doctor without losing your job. I want to say, if you work overtime because you need to or because you have to, and a family emergency comes up, you ought to be able to decide whether to take that overtime in pay or in time with your family. It ought to be your decision because that will make us a stronger country. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century?

Our balanced budget plan gives help to families that are between jobs so they can keep their health insurance for 6 more months. It adds another million children to the ranks of the insured. It gives free mammograms to women on Medicare. It gives—there are over 1 1/2 million families in this country today doing a brave and good and honorable thing, caring for a family member with Alzheimer's. It is a very hard thing. I've lost an aunt and an uncle. I can tell you, it is a loving thing; it is a debilitating thing. Our balanced budget plan gives respite care support to those families who are caring for their family members. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century?

Our opponents, including Congressman Allard, not only voted against putting 100,000 police on the street, they passed a budget that would have stopped it.

I'll just give you one example. Ten million American children still live within just 4 miles of a toxic waste site.

Forty percent of our children who are 8 years old, third graders, still cannot read a book on their own. A lot of it is because they come from other places; their first language is not English. But that will be cold comfort to them if they can't learn as they move on through school."", 'I have a plan to mobilize 30,000 AmeriCorps and other reading specialists to get them to put together a million volunteers. In this last budget we got 200,000 more work-study slots for college students.

Ten million young people now have lower cost college loans, and they can pay them back as a percentage of their income instead of being overrun by debt when they get out of college, but we need to do more. I want to make at least 2 years of education after high school as universal in America as a high school diploma is today in the next 4 years. I want to do it by letting Americans deduct dollar for dollar from their tax bill the cost of a typical community college tuition. No bureaucracy, no program, just send people and say, you make your grades, stay in, and you can go to community college for free. You can do it in America."", ""I want to give every American the right to deduct up to $10,000 a year for the cost of any college tuition, undergraduate or graduate. I believe families should be able to save for college in an IRA and withdraw from it without any tax penalty if they're using the money to pay for college or health care or a first-time home. Will you help me build that bridge? [Applause]"", ""Between now and Tuesday you may hear someone say that your vote doesn't matter. After you have heard this tonight, do you have something to say back to them? Will you say it? [Applause]"", 'Folks, before I came here today I was in Ypsilanti, Michigan, on the campus of Eastern Michigan University. And I was there at a big conference with 4,000 women business owners. There were three women who preceded me on the program. I want to tell you about them. One came here as an immigrant from Mexico as a child, of Syrian heritage. Her parents were Syrians living in Mexico. She spoke not a word of English. She got married. She had children. Her husband ran a car dealership. He died suddenly in 1984. She could have sold the business and at least lived comfortably in retirement. Instead, she says, ""Maybe I can be a businesswoman."" Today that woman owns 5 car dealerships and has 260 employees.', 'The second, a young woman with very little formal education, was making a living cleaning houses. And she was hitchhiking home one day from a job she had. And the person who was giving her a ride said, ""You know, I\'m amazed you don\'t have more work. Everybody I know has got both people in the house working. I bet you could find more jobs."" This woman, hitchhiking home from work, had the idea that she would start her own business. She borrowed $11,000 from one of our programs—$11,000. Today she runs a house-cleaning business with 29 employees.', 'The third woman was a former welfare recipient who today owns a construction company. That is America.', ""And every one of them—every one of them made it on their own, all right; if they hadn't worked hard, if they hadn't had talent, if they hadn't had stick-to-itiveness, if they hadn't been willing to face failure down, they would not have made it. But they also got a little help from their friends, the American people, to work together and make this country a greater place."", ""I want you to go home tonight and ask yourself this question: What do I want America to look like and how are we going to get there. And I think you will say, we have got to join hands. We've got to build a bridge that is big enough and wide enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across. And if we do it, the best days of this country are still ahead."", ""Let's go build that bridge between now and Tuesday. Thank you, and God bless you all.""]"
125,William J. Clinton ,"October 30, 1996","[""Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to ask right here at the beginning that we give another round of applause not only to Irma Elder but to Juanita Bycraft Walker and to Gail Davis. The three of them represent the whole range of women's businesses in America today. Let's give them a hand. They were great. Thank you. [Applause]"", ""Thank you. Let me say I am delighted to be back at Eastern Michigan, where I prepared for one of my debates in 1992. I had a great time here then, and I'm glad to be back now. I want to thank both the marching band and the concert band for playing for us today. Thank you very much."", ""And just on a purely personal point, I first heard of Eastern Michigan University a long time ago when I hired a young man from one of the poorest counties in America out of the Mississippi Delta, right on the river of the Mississippi in my home State, to work for me in the attorney general's office and later in the Governor's office, who told me he had been given his start in life when he got a football scholarship to Eastern Michigan University. And that young man, Rodney Slater, is now the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, investing billions of dollars in growing the American economy through infrastructure. So you can always be proud of your mission here and what you're doing and the opportunity you've given to people."", ""I'd like to thank Vice President Juanita Reid for making me feel so welcome today, and Michelle Vasquez, the executive director of the Ann Arbor Community Development Corporation. Senator and Mrs. Riegle, thank you for coming. Congressman Ford, thank you for coming. I'd like to acknowledge the presence here of the Director of the Small Business Administration, Phil Lader, and the head of the White House Office on Women's Affairs, Betsy Myers, who have both done a wonderful job for the women business owners of America. Thank you very much. Thank you, Senator Carl Levin, for your speech and for your service to Michigan. And I have a great deal of confidence that you're going to get your service extended in 6 more days."", ""And I was looking at Lynn Rivers give her speech, and I thought, I wish everybody in America could see this woman give her talk, could hear her story. I wish everybody in America could meet her husband who's working down at the UAW—Ford plant down the road here and can't be here today. That represents what America is all about. The story that Irma told of her life represents what America's all about. The stories that Juanita and Gail told of their lives represent what America's all about."", 'I especially want to thank Lynn Rivers for not forgetting where she came from when she went to Congress and for voting to give every other person in America the same chance to make the most of his or her own life that she did.', ""I ran for this office 4 years ago with a vision of what our country should look like when we start the 21st century, a simple but profound one. I want every person in America, without regard to their background, to have a chance to live out their dreams if they're responsible enough to work for it. I want our country to keep leading the world for peace and freedom and prosperity. And I want us—and as I look around this room today I feel good about it— I want us to defy the trend that is bedeviling the rest of the world and say, we are not going to be consumed by our differences; we're going to celebrate our diversity and go forward together in an America where everybody has a chance to make it."", ""As Senator Levin said, we've had a good run of success in trying to turn the economy around. We have cut the deficit by 63 percent. We have seen America produce 10 1/2 million more jobs. We have seen an income increase of $1,600 for the typical family in the last 2 years. We know we have the lowest combined rates of unemployment, inflation, and home mortgages in 28 years, the biggest drop in inequality of incomes among working people in 27 years, the biggest drop in poverty among female-headed households in 30 years, the biggest drop in childhood poverty in 20 years. We're moving in the right direction, and that's a good thing. We know that small business has a lot to do with that."", ""One of the things that I'm proudest of is that this has happened while we have reduced the size of the Federal Government and increased the percentage of new jobs in America being created by the private sector. In each of the last 3 years, the number of new businesses started has reached record levels. This has included a surge in businesses owned by all kinds of Americans: more than 220,000 new Hispanic businesses, more than 100,000 new African-American businesses, the highest rate of business ownership in both minority groups ever recorded, and a record number of new small businesses owned by women."", 'Women are establishing businesses and creating new jobs at twice the national rate of business and job growth. One-third of all the businesses in our country, about 8 million companies now, are owned by women. They employ one in five of American workers. Here in Michigan, over a quarter of a million women-owned businesses employ over a half-million people. In 1992, women-owned businesses contributed $1.6 trillion to our economy. Today, in only 4 years, that number has grown to $2.3 trillion. I might say, there are a very, very few countries in the world that have an annual output of more than $2.3 trillion.', 'In every community, in every State, the face of our businesses are changing. Every day it looks more and more like the people in this room, men and women, people of color, increasingly Americans with disabilities are becoming business owners. More and more people are finding ways to make the free enterprise system work for them. That supports stronger families, more stable communities, and a much, much stronger America with a brighter future. Today we received some more good news: Our economy is continuing to grow steady and strong, with an annual growth rate of nearly 3 percent; real incomes for American workers, after being stagnant for virtually 20 years, are rising at nearly 5 percent, with no inflation in this economy.', 'And the future in many ways looks even better, because in the past 3 months alone, business investment has risen at 18.9 percent, and the rate of investment now is the strongest since President Kennedy was in office over 30 years ago. There is an extreme increase in the expectation that we can keep our free enterprise system growing, flourishing, growing stronger, with rising incomes, more businesses, more jobs. And we cannot turn back on that.', ""What we are trying to do, of course, goes beyond economics, but when the economy improves, it makes our other common endeavors more likely to succeed. I think just in the last 4 years we've had 4 years of declining crime rates, 4 years of declining welfare rolls, 1.9 million fewer Americans on the welfare rolls than 4 years ago."", ""I think of the fact that we now have a sense that we can actually begin to reform our health care system in a positive way. The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill says to 25 million Americans, you can't lose your health insurance anymore if you change jobs or someone in your family gets sick. I just signed a bill which says that mothers and their newborn babies can't be kicked out of the hospital in 24 hours anymore. I think that's very important."", ""So this thing—we're moving this in the right direction. But I want to focus today a little bit on small business because we know that increasingly more and more and more of our jobs are coming from our small businesses. And I'd like to talk a little bit about that."", ""When I became President, it troubled me that there were certain critical jobs that previous Presidents, both Republicans and Democrats, had typically given to political appointees without regard to whether they knew anything about the work they were supposed to do. One of them was the Federal Emergency Management Administration. I had been a Governor; I'd dealt with a lot of floods and fires and tornadoes and natural disasters. And I can tell you when they hit, if you don't have somebody who knows what they're doing, you're in a world of hurt. So I changed that. I put a person in who knew what to do. And as you know, we've had a lot of natural disasters in America in the last 4 years; everything but the locusts have hit us. [Laughter] But people know in all local communities that we now have a competent, aggressive strategy for dealing with it."", ""And that was true in the Small Business Administration. I've had two Administrators in the Small Business Administration, Erskine Bowles and Phil Lader, both of them experienced in starting small businesses and running small businesses and understanding how businesses work. We have doubled the loan volume of the SBA in the last 4 years while reducing the budget. We have cut the regulations by 50 percent in the SBA. For loan applications of $100,000 or less, we've gone from an application form that is one inch thick to a form that is one page, in 4 years."", 'The White House Conference on Small Business asked us to do a number of things. We have now, in two different bites, in 1993 and 1996, increased the expensing for small businesses who invest more in their own business from $10,000 a year all the way to $25,000 a year, the number one recommendation we got out of the White House Conference. The second thing that we were asked to do was to make it easier for people who own small businesses and for their employees to take out 401(k) pension plans and to move those plans when they change from job to job, and we have done that. And I am very proud of that.', 'I signed regulatory legislation which will make it more difficult in the future for Government to do things that are dumb to small-business people without giving small-business people a chance to stop it in the first place.', ""We established a network of community development banks, each with a mission to have a microenterprise loan program like those which many of you have experienced around here. If you think about it, microenterprise loans have helped to revolutionize the culture of poverty in countries far poorer than America all over the world. Why couldn't we revolutionize the culture of poverty in our inner cities and other isolated areas with microenterprise loans in America to bring free enterprise? Women can lead the way in this."", ""And in general, I'm proud of the fact that we have reduced the size of Government by about 250,000 to its smallest point in 30 years. We have reduced 16,000 pages of regulations. We have eliminated hundreds of programs. We have privatized significant chunks of the Federal Government that belonged in the private sector—more reduction in size, regulation, and programs and more privatization in these 4 years than in the previous 12 years combined, giving you a smaller, less bureaucratic Government, but one still committed to investing in education, protecting the environment, and moving this country forward together, giving everybody a chance to live up to the fullest of their own capacities."", ""Today we are taking two more steps to extend opportunities that come from small businesses. First, I want to build on a program that is plainly working. We established in 1994 a women's prequalification pilot loan program for loan applications of under $250,000 in 16 sites. That's kind of a mouthful; you know, I wish I had some fancy acronym for it. But what it meant in basic terms was, in these 16 places, we worked with women who wanted to start businesses or wanted to expand businesses and needed capital, and we worked up the loan application in advance for them so we knew it would have a good chance of being approved at the bank. And we gave them a commitment on the front end that the SBA would guarantee it. Now, since that happened in just 16 sites, 575 separate women businesses have gotten over $58 million in loans. We are now going to do that nationwide. We will make that service available to women in every State in the United States."", ""The second thing we're going to do relates to another request we got out of the White House Conference on Small Businesses for loans above $250,000. There we were told over and over, at the White House Conference on Small Business, that the biggest problem was finding capital, even for worthy enterprises, if the business were small. So we are now starting something new that came directly out of the White House Conference that does have a catchy acronym—I can say that better—the Angel Capital Electronic Network, or ACENET, a new computer website that will allow small-business owners to put their prospectus on the Internet and match small businesses with sophisticated investors. That will make it much, much easier than ever before for people who are in small business to get money. I hope a lot of you can take advantage of it. This new net site will allow women business owners to go directly to investors to avoid confusing rules, lack of information, and their lack of access to what we ought to call, I guess, the old boy networks. It will work if you will make it work."", ""These are just two more things that are part of our ongoing commitment. Now, let me say there is a lot more to do. We have a lot to do to build a bridge that I want to build to the 21st century, to realize the vision that I have. I hope every one of you tonight, whatever your political party or background, will take a little time before you turn in to do something that I do on a regular basis. Take a little time and ask yourself, what do I want my country to look like when we start the new century? And what would I like my country to look like when my children are my age? It's an amazing thing what that does for you when you ask that question and how you answer it."", 'But as I said, for me it\'s simple. I just want everybody to have the chances that I had, that Lynn Rivers had, that so many of us had. We wouldn\'t be here today, I think, if we had all been told, ""You\'re on your own."" Most of us are pretty self-reliant, or we wouldn\'t be in this room. But I still believe that, as someone reasonably close to me said, it does take a village to raise our children and grow our economy and build our future. That\'s what I believe.', ""So I say to you, we have to balance the budget, and I hope every one of you will help lead the demand that we continue to do so, because that will keep those interest rates down, it will keep the economy going, it will make that money more available to you. But we have to do it while we continue to invest in our future and in Medicaid's guarantee of health care to families with members with disabilities or poor children or the elderly in nursing homes and in the Medicare program. We can reform those programs without wrecking them, and we still can invest in our future, in education and technology and in research as well."", 'When people—I hear people say, ""I\'m me, and the Government is them."" I don\'t know what they\'re talking about, because the Government is nothing but the reflection of the collective choices of the American people. And the issue is, what are these things that we do? We\'ve had a great debate in Washington for the last 4 years that I think has been very healthy for the country: What things should we do together at the national level; what things can be better done by States and localities; what things can be better done in the private sector; what things can better be done by families? And we\'ve had huge differences, which I think have been healthy.', ""I think we did the right thing on family and medical leave. We're stronger because you can take a little time off from sizeable employers when a baby is born or somebody in your family is sick, without losing your job. If you can succeed at home and at work, the country is better, not worse, because of that. That makes us stronger. It makes us stronger."", 'I think it\'s a better country because we cut the cost of college loans for people that participate in the direct loan program and said, ""You can pay that loan off as a percentage of your income so you never need to be afraid of borrowing money to go to school, because now you won\'t be bankrupted paying it back. Your limited payments every year will be limited to a certain percentage of your income."" I think that made us a better, stronger country because we made more people eligible to go to college.', 'Therefore, I believe we should go forward in that spirit. We should be committed to growing our economy. We should be committed to doing it through the free enterprise system. We should be committed to continuing to make our Government as lean and efficient and as little bureaucratic as possible. But there are things we ought to do together.', ""And the education thing is so important to me. I don't believe we can afford the big tax plan my opponent has proposed because I think it will blow a hole in the deficit and will give it all right back in higher interest rates and a weaker economy, and because it will require even bigger cuts than I vetoed last year. But I do think we should have targeted tax cuts to help families raise their children, to help people afford health care and buying that first-time home, and especially to pay for the cost of education."", 'I believe as strongly as I can say—and I want to give Michigan another hand here, or at least one of my friends in Michigan—I got interested in the idea that we ought to make college available to everyone when Governor Blanchard started the Michigan tuition savings plan here. I remember that.', ""And so we have given almost 70,000 young people a chance to earn money for college through AmeriCorps. We've given the improvements I mentioned in the student loan program. We're now selling inflation-proof savings bonds for people so they can save, knowing that inflation won't eat up the gains. But I'd like to do some more things. I believe that we ought to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without penalty if the money is used for a college education or health care or buying a first home—more people."", ""I believe—even at this distinguished university let me say that we know from the census figures that if people get at least 2 years of education after high school in a good community college, they've got a good chance to get a job that is a good job with growing prospects. Almost every American lives within driving distance of one, so I have proposed to give Americans a $1,500 tax credit, the typical cost of community college tuition, a dollar-for-dollar reduction from your taxes, for the first 2 years of college as long as people go, make their grades, and do what they're supposed to do. I think it's a good thing to do. And I believe we ought to give everybody a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year for any tuition at any institution of higher education anywhere in America for undergraduate or graduate studies—Eastern Michigan, anyplace else in the country. It will change the face of America if we open the doors of college education to all of our people."", ""Now, let me say, since one of the women on the stage with me has worked herself off welfare into being a business owner, I am very proud of the fact that we've worked hard with the States to reduce the welfare rolls by nearly 2 million. I signed the welfare reform bill because it now guarantees to poor families health care and nutrition and more for child care than ever if they go to work. But it now says to all the States and local communities, if you have an able-bodied person, you have 2 years to turn the welfare check into a paycheck."", ""I like that, but if we're going to do it, what it means is we have to create the jobs. I have a plan to give those folks the opportunity to go to work: investing in our communities with the microenterprise loans, with special incentives to employers. And every one of you—let me just say, if you ever criticized the welfare system in your life, which includes 100 percent of the American people, I think, and especially people who have been on it, and you're now an employer, you ought to think about hiring someone off welfare. You ought to think about doing that now."", ""Under the new law, every State in America can give you the welfare check for a year or two while you—as a wage subsidy, under the new law. If my new proposal passes, we'll have a special tax credit. If we get all the community development banks that I want, there will be microenterprise loans for people to do that."", ""We can do this. We can break the culture of poverty in America, but only if we create opportunity. It's one thing to tell somebody in the law they have to go to work and quite another to make sure that there is a job there. You have to do that, and I will help you, and I hope you will."", ""Again, let me say, our country is going in the right direction. I thank Senator Carl Levin and Congresswoman Lynn Rivers for the votes they cast to put it there. Some of them were awful tough, when we were told we were going to bring on a recession and all that. But we're better off than we were. We're going in the right direction. We have made unprecedented gains in the area of helping women to start their businesses, to stay in business, to expand their businesses, and that has helped to lift the rate of growth of the American economy and our capacity to create jobs."", ""I was a little amused today; my distinguished opponent said that we had the worst economy in 20 years. Now, 2 weeks ago he said it was the worst economy in 100 years, so we're making progress—[laughter]—and I feel good about that. Not everybody can make up 80 years in 2 weeks, and I'm proud, you know. [Laughter] But he was right in February. In February he said we had the best economy we've had in 30 years, and he was right when he said that. And I don't deserve all the credit for that. No one does. But our policies have helped you to create those jobs. And we are working together. And that's my whole theory of how this country should work. And I'll just leave you with that."", ""No matter what vision you have for the future, one of the things that I know in my bones is that the great meal ticket America has to the 21st century—which will clearly be the time of greatest human possibility ever known, where more people will have more chances to live out their dreams than any time in history, where the young people that are in this audience will be doing jobs that haven't been invented yet, many of them will be doing work that has not even been imagined yet—our great ticket to that 21st century is our vibrant democracy, our vibrant free enterprise system, and the fact that in America we can say, we will take anybody from anywhere who is here lawfully."", ""We don't have to know much about you— if you were born in Mexico of Syrian descent, or we don't need to know how much Cherokee Indian blood you have in you. We don't need to know anything about you except that you believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, and you're willing to show up for work or school or do whatever you're supposed to do tomorrow. We need to know nothing else. We're not going to be like Bosnia. We're not going to be consumed by religious hatred as they are in the Middle East. We're not going to be fighting battles 300 and 600 years old, as my ancestors' people are in Ireland. We're not going to do that in America."", ""And when people try to do it, when they blow up Federal buildings or burn churches or desecrate synagogues or Islamic centers, we're going to say, we are against that because our America has everybody in it. And we're going to build a bridge to the future together."", 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"

We need each other, and we'll do better when we work forward together. Will you help me build that kind of America? [Applause]"", ""Four years ago, when I came to the American people with Al Gore and said we wanted a different kind of political direction, we wanted to break out of the mold of the old debates and take America forward, we thought the right and left, liberal and conservative debate was sterile and outdated and the issue was what we had to do together to move our country forward, the American people took me on faith—and we came within one percentage point of carrying Arizona. I hope you'll help us do just a little better on Tuesday."", ""But today, you don't have to do that. There is a record. You can make a judgment based on the evidence about whether this approach is going to make you more likely to live out your dreams in the 21st century, more likely to make this a more responsible and caring society in the 21st century, more likely to preserve the greatness that has always been America's hallmark."", 'Compared to 4 years ago, we have 10 1/2 million more jobs. We have the lowest combined rates of unemployment, inflation, and home mortgages in 27 years, the biggest drop in inequality among working families in 27 years, the biggest drop in child poverty in 20 years, the highest homeownership rates in 15 years.

We are moving the right direction."", ""Income for the typical family is up about $1,600 in the last 2 years. Our air is cleaner. Our drinking water is safer.

We are moving forward and growing the economy while preserving our environment. We are moving in the right direction."", ""Just in the last couple of days, we've seen that our annual growth rate is about 3 percent, that business investment increased by almost 19 percent, the highest rate since the Kennedy administration. Incomes are rising nearly 5 percent, and in the face of that news and 10 1/2 million jobs, yesterday my opponent said that we had the worst economy in 20 years. Well, 2 weeks ago he said we had the worst economy in 100 years. We've made up 80 years in 2 weeks. That's a good record. We need to do more of that.

We have eliminated more Government regulations, more Government programs, we have privatized more Government operations in 3 1/2 years than my Republican predecessors did in 12 years. Our budget would be in surplus today if it weren't for the debt they ran up in the 12 years before I took office.

And then there are those of us who say that future out there is for all of us, and it\'ll be better for all of us if we just go on and build a bridge big enough, wide enough, and strong enough for all of us to walk across together. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', 'On this Halloween day, we can make a lot of jokes, and I was thrilled to see all the people along the roadway already in their Halloween costumes and their masks on. But one serious thing I\'d like to say about Halloween—Hillary and I always loved the fact that our daughter loved Halloween, always wanted her own costume every Halloween, still likes to go out trickor-treating. But one of the things that I think is important on Halloween is we remember that we want Halloween to be ""fright night,"" but ""safe night"" for our families and our children. And we ought to think about today what I think is the critical thing for American families, which is, how can we make our families safe, how can we give them a clean environment, and how can we make it possible for parents to succeed economically while they raise their children responsibly?', 'Everywhere I go in America, people say to me, ""I\'m having problems doing the right thing by my kids and working."" The average working family is spending more hours a week at work today than 25 years ago. So today I want to just take a minute to ask you what you think would build strong families, and would we be better off saying, ""You\'re on your own,"" or ""Here\'s what we can do together to give you the tools to build a stronger family life.""', ""I supported the Family and Medical Leave Act. Now, my opponent led the opposition to it and tried to kill it with a filibuster in the Senate because he honestly believed—he honestly believed that it would be bad for the economy. But now we know. After 3 years, 12 million people have taken advantage of the family leave law to take a little time off from work without losing their jobs when a baby is born or a family member is sick. We have 10 1/2 million new jobs, record numbers of new small businesses. This economy is churning along. We're moving in the right direction. You help the economy if you help parents take care of their children. They do better at work, and they feel better."", ""And I'd like to see the family leave law expanded a little bit so parents can go see their children's teachers twice a year and take them to the doctor without losing their jobs. I believe when parents earn overtime, they ought to have the option to take that overtime in pay, or if their parents or their children or their spouses are sick, I think they ought to be able to take that overtime in time with their families. That's the choice of the people who earn it. It'll make stronger families. But you have to decide."", 'I believe we value families when we have welfare reform that is good to children but tough in work requirements, that requires teen mothers to live at home or in a supervised setting and stay in school to draw benefits, and requires able-bodied people to go to work but gives them the child care and the jobs there to do the work and succeed at home and at work, just the way we want for everybody else in this society.', ""And I believe we value families when we open the doors of college education to all Americans. My fellow Americans, in the 12 years before I became President—and this is no one in particular's fault, but many of you will know this— the only basic thing in a family's budget that increased at a higher inflation rate than health care was the cost of a college education. We have worked hard through AmeriCorps to give 70,000 more young people a chance to work their way through college by serving in their communities. Some of you are here today. Thank you, and God bless you. We reformed we have discovered, medical researchers, the first real treatment for stroke victims that offers promise. Two of the genes which cause breast cancer were just uncovered. And I allocated another $30 million to that research just a week ago. It is really within our reach not only to cure but prevent that disease in the future."", 'For the first time, a few weeks ago a laboratory animal with its spine completely severed had movement in its lower limbs because of nerve transplants to the spine from other parts of the body. These are unbelievable things. We just signed a contract, the United States Government did, with IBM to build jointly a supercomputer over the next couple of years that will do as many calculations in one second as you can do at home on your calculator in 30,000 years.', ""This world is changing. And America is faced with the question of what to do about the changes. When I ran for President 4 years ago, I had a vision of what I wanted our country to be like in the 21st century. And I'm so glad there are so many young people here today because that will be your century. For me, it's pretty straightforward. I want every child in America, without regard to race or gender or where you start out in life, to have the same chance to live up to your God-given abilities and the same chance to live out your dreams that I and the members of my generation had. You deserve it, and I am determined to see that you get it."", ""I want our great country to continue to be the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity. And I know that makes me do things from time to time that aren't especially popular, whether it's trying to stop the bloody war in Bosnia or kick the dictators out in Haiti or stand up for the cause of peace in Northern Ireland or try to deal with the problems of our neighbors to the south in Mexico. But America is stronger today than it was 4 years ago. No Russian missiles are pointed at our children today, for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age, and we're moving in the right direction there."", ""And I want our country to be coming together around our basic values. I want us to be able to celebrate, laugh about, cherish our diversity, and say, we're bound together by our belief in the values that have made America great, but otherwise we don't discriminate against anybody. We want to go forward in an American community in which everybody has a place and a role to play."", 'Five days before this election, I want you to be upbeat about America, optimistic about your future, and determined to make the choice that will guarantee that that vision can be made real in your lives and the lives of your friends and neighbors. That is the choice.', ""For me, it is best expressed in this idea of a bridge to the 21st century. I believe that there's a real difference here between Senator Dole and me, between Senator Coffin and Congressman Ensign. And I believe it's an honest difference. I don't like all this harsh rhetoric and personal attacks and attempts to convince people that your opponent is no good. I don't think there is very much to that."", ""I'm about to end my last campaign. I can tell you this: I've been working at this for over 20 years now. Most of the people I've met in both parties, from all points on the political spectrum, have loved our country, have wanted what was best for it, worked hard and were honest, contrary to the image that is often portrayed. There are honest differences here, and you should be exuberant that you have a choice to make between honest differences."", ""I don't believe that we should go into this— I know that there will be more individual choices than ever before. I know people can do things on their computers and will be able to do more. Pretty soon you can do all your shopping by computers. People won't even have to go out the door if they don't want to. I know that there will be more opportunities for us to do things as individuals. But I still believe that our country will only be great if we are determined to build a bridge to the future that we're all going to be able to walk across together, if we give everybody the tools to make the most of his or her own life. That's what I believe."", 'And that\'s the choice. Would we be better off being told, ""You\'re on your own, and we hope you do well,"" or as a person I\'m reasonably close to once said, do we believe it takes a village to raise a child, to build a future, to build a country? That is the choice.', 'That was the choice we faced starkly about a year ago when Senator Dole and Congressman Gingrich and Congressman Ensign voted for a budget that would have cut education for the first time in modern history, would have reduced the number of children in Head Start, get tougher on dangerous gangs. I believe we can do more if we finish the work of giving our children something to say yes to instead of just saying no to them. We have to give them a future that is worthy of their dreams, their aspirations, and their potential, and I want you to help me do it. Will you do it? [Applause]', 'Your vote will decide whether we strengthen our families by giving our children world-class education, whether we mobilize a million volunteers, including college students all over America, to make sure every young person can read a book independently by the third grade. I want you to know, just before the Congress went home, I signed a bill that created 200,000 more work-study positions. I want 100,000 of them to go to people who say, ""I want every 8-yearold to be able to pick up a book and say ‘I can read this all by myself.""\' Will you help us do that? [Applause]', ""Will you help us connect every classroom and library in America to the Internet and the World Wide Web, the information superhighway? Will you help us open the doors of college education to all? [Applause] I say again, the issue for Arizona, the issue for America is this: We stand on the threshold of a new century, on the threshold of a very different time. All of you know that we are undergoing dramatic changes in the way we work and live and relate to each other and the rest of the world. We are becoming an increasingly global society. We are working in different ways. When I became President, only 3 million Americans made their living by working at home. Today, 12 million do. In 4 years, 30 million will. That's just one example."", 'We are pushing back the frontiers of learning as never before. When I became President, AIDS was still thought to be a death sentence. The life expectancy of people with HIV and AIDS has more than doubled in the last 4 years, thanks to medical research and faster movement of drugs. We have now, for the first time ever, medical treatment for strokes. We\'ve identified two of the genes that cause breast cancer, and we may be able to eliminate it entirely. For the first time ever, laboratory animals with their spines completely severed have regained movement in their lower limbs through nerve transplants to the spine from other parts of their bodies. We are building a supercomputer in cooperation with IBM that will do more calculations in a second than you can do on a handheld calculator in 30,000 years. We are moving into a very different future. And what you have to decide is whether you have the courage to say, ""I believe that our best days are still ahead, if we have opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community in which we all have a part to play and a place at the table.""', 'You have to decide whether we\'re going to go into the future by saying, ""You\'re on your own,"" or whether we\'re going to build a bridge. And you have to decide whether you\'re really willing to say, ""Whether you\'re Hispanic or African-American or Asian-American or Native American or Polish or Irish or whatever, it doesn\'t matter. If you believe in the Declaration of Independence, in the Bill of Rights, in the Constitution, if you\'re willing to show up tomorrow and work or study and do your job as a citizen, we don\'t need to know anything else about you. You are part of our America, and we\'re going forward."" Will you help me in Arizona to build that bridge? Will you be there on Tuesday? Will you talk to your friends? [Applause]', ""God bless you. Let's do it. Your best days are ahead. Thank you.""]"
127,William J. Clinton ,"October 31, 1996","['The President. Thank you. I think the first thing I should say is, happy birthday, Nevada. I am so glad to be here today, so delighted to see all of you here in not only large numbers but with genuine enthusiasm. You should feel good about your country and good about our future.', 'I want to thank the Green Valley High School Band for playing the national anthem, thank you; the Las Vegas Academy of International Studies, Performing Visual Arts, thank you. I want to thank the saxophonists who played here earlier from the musicians union and the mariachi band.', ""Thank you, Madam Mayor. Thank you, County Commission Vice Chair Paul Christianson. You arranged a beautiful day for us here today. I'd also like to say a special word of appreciation to a person who is not here with us today, the county commission chair, Yvonne Atkinson-Gates. We're thinking about her, and we miss her. Senator Dina Titus, Assembly Leader Richard Perkins. Thank you, Gladys Knight, for coming and speaking. Thank you, Andre Agassi, for coming. Thank you. Thank you, Attorney General Frankie Sue Del Papa. And thank you, my good friend Harry Reid."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, I owe a lot to a lot of people. I'm on the verge of finishing the last campaign I'll ever be in unless I run for the school board someday. And I want to say that every time I come here to Las Vegas, I think of my wonderful mother who loved this community so much and loved to come here. And I wish she were here with me still for this election. I want to thank the mayor for always being so kind to her. And I want to say a special word of thanks, too, to Governor Bob Miller for being there with me in good times and bad—always there, always supporting us, always standing up for what was right and standing up for Nevada."", ""And I want to tell you that something I have said in the Oval Office of the White House many times—I'd like to say here in public: I believe in Washington, DC, the most underappreciated public servant in the United States Senate is Harry Reid of Nevada. He is a remarkable, remarkable Senator. You should be very proud of him. You should be very proud of him. You know, because he's a gentleman and he's low-key and he just says what he has to say in a town where hot air and hot rhetoric and divisive actions take precedent, very often the people who really make a difference are not appreciated. Harry Reid should be appreciated here, and every day he's more appreciated back there in Washington."", 'And thank you, Nell Justice, for having the courage to get up here and give a speech in front of all these people and for embodying, to me, what my job, this campaign, and our common destiny is all about. We are about to choose the last President of the 20th century and the first President of the 21st century. I believe more strongly than I can say that the greatest days of this country lie before us; that if we make the right decisions, if we do what we have always done in the past at critical times, if we meet our challenges and do it in a way that enables us to live more closely toward our values, our young people here will live in the age of greatest possibility the world has ever known.', ""We are dramatically changing the way we work and live, the way we relate to each other and the rest of the world. A lot of these changes are very good, but some of them pose very stiff challenges to families. I'll give you one example of the changes that are going on."", ""When I became President there were about 3 million people working in their homes and making a living. The other day I was in Atlanta at a rally, and I was introduced by a young woman. She and her husband were from Georgia. They were living in New York. They both had jobs there. He got a job in Atlanta; they moved back to Atlanta. She's still working for her company in New York, in Atlanta, because of the computer. There were 3 million people doing that in 1992. There are 12 million people doing that in 1996. There will be 30 million people doing that in the year 2000. That is just one example."", 'The frontiers of knowledge are being pushed back dramatically. The life expectancy for people with HIV and AIDS is more than twice what it was just 4 years ago. We have uncovered— eliminated the AmeriCorps national service program, cut college loans, terribly, terribly, terribly weakened the ability of the United States to protect our environment and to continue to enhance it.', ""It would have repealed for the first time in 30 years our guarantee of health care to elderly people in nursing homes, to the very standards of care we have in nursing homes. It would repeal the guarantee of care to our poorest children and the middle class families who have family members with disabilities who can maintain a middle class lifestyle because we try to provide decent health care. It would have done all that. It would have allowed employers to raid their employees' pension funds and actually raise taxes on the hardest pressed working families in America. And I vetoed it because I thought it was wrong."", ""And they thought it was so right for America, they shut the Government down. And they thought that we were such Government lovers, because that's the picture postcard cutout that's always made of us, that all of us would just sort of cave in and let them have their way. And I told them I'd a lot rather see the American people hurt for 3 weeks than for 30 years; no, thank you, we weren't going to have that budget."", ""But I don't believe that these people didn't believe what they were doing. I think they believed what they were doing was right. But I think they were wrong. And that's what you have to decide. Are we going to build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past? Are we going to go forward together or be told we're on our own? These are big, big decisions."", ""Now, 4 years ago when the people in Nevada voted for Al Gore and Bill Clinton, you took us on faith. You don't have to do that anymore. There is a record. And our friends have to face the fact that there is a record. We do have 10 1/2 million more jobs than we had 4 years ago. We do have incomes rising for the first time in a decade, about $1,600 over the last 2 years for the typical family. We do have the largest drop in child poverty in 20 years, the largest drop in income inequality among working people in 27 years, the lowest rates of unemployment, inflation, and home mortgages combined in 27 years. Those are facts. That's where we are. We're going in the right direction."", 'We do have a 15-year high in homeownership. We do have 4 years now of declining crime rates, which is why every major law enforcement organization in America has endorsed the Clinton/Gore ticket for reelection, because we have proved we can lower the crime rate.', ""We do have 4 years of declining welfare rolls, 1.9 million fewer people on the welfare rolls. We do have cleaner air, safer drinking water, higher standards for food safety. We do have vast new protections for our natural resources: the biggest national park network ever created south of Alaska in the Mojave Desert in California; 1.7 million acres of wilderness in southern Utah, the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. We're cleaning up the Florida Everglades. We're moving this country forward, and we have proved, yes, you can grow the economy and preserve the environment at the same time. We have proved that."", 'Ten million people benefited from the increase in the minimum wage. Twelve million people took a little time off when a baby was born or a family member was sick without losing their jobs because of family leave. Twenty-five million Americans may be able to keep their health insurance now because we passed a law that says you cannot have your health insurance jerked from you because you changed jobs or someone in your family has been sick.', ""America is a better place because I signed a law that says mothers and their newborn babies can't be kicked out of the hospital in 24 hours, too. We're a better place because we're trying to provide more insurance coverage for mental health problems that so many of our families face. We're a better place because finally, after so long, way too long, we're giving health care and disability benefits to Vietnam veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange whose children have spina bifida as a result of it. We're a better place because we're doing these things together. We're a better place because child support collections are up 50 percent, $4 billion a year in the last 4 years. This is a better place."", ""So I say to you, my fellow Americans, you don't just totally have to take it on faith anymore. There is a record. The evidence is there. And the question now is, what are we going to do for the future? I know it's Halloween, you know. And I understand why on Halloween people like to scare other people. But yesterday—with new evidence our economy is growing at about 3 percent a year, better than any other industrial country; we've got a 5 percent increase in personal income after inflation this year; we've got the highest rate of business investment since John Kennedy was President— and we've done the things I've described, as they said, having the smallest Federal Government since President Kennedy, and we abolished more Government programs, more Government regulations and privatized more Government operations than the Republicans did in the 12 years they ran before our administration. So I understand all that."", 'So along comes my opponent yesterday and says we have the worst economy in 20 years. Do you believe that?', 'Audience members. No-o-o!', 'The President. Is this the worst economy in Las Vegas in 20 years?', 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. If you think it is, you ought to vote for him. But now, the interesting thing is, this being Halloween, is that 2 weeks ago he said we had the worst economy in 100 years. I made up 80 years in just 2 weeks. I think you ought to feel good. Now, back in February, Senator Dole, in a more candid and open and accurate moment, said we had the best economy in 30 years—the best economy. That's when he was right."", 'That doesn\'t mean we don\'t have more to do. And one of the things that I worry about all the time is—you know, life is about more than economics. Most of us work so that we\'ll have the wherewithal to live in the way we want to live, to raise our children well, to enjoy our lives, to find some personal fulfillment, to have good lives. And on Halloween, even though it\'s supposed to be ""fright night,"" I always think that what I really want is a safer Halloween for all of our children and stronger families and safer neighborhoods.', ""So I say to you, I want you to feel good about America, and I want you to make this choice based on these two big ideas, because we still have more work to do. If we want to strengthen our families, we have to help parents succeed at home and at work. I was for the family leave law; he was against it. We had an honest difference of opinion. He said it would hurt the economy, but we've had 3 years of record starts of new small businesses and over 10 million jobs. You know who was right and who was wrong. The evidence is there."", ""And I think we ought to extend family leave. I think people ought to be able to go see their children's teachers twice a year and go to the doctor's appointment with them without losing their jobs."", 'There is nothing more important than helping parents succeed at home and at work. If the parents of America have to choose between their children or their job, we are in trouble, whichever choice they have to make. Their most important job is raising our children, but we have to have a strong economy. If we have a strong economy at the expense of raising our children, what are we working for anyway? We have got to work to create conditions in which everybody believes, ""I can do my work, and I can still be a good parent."" There is no more important agenda for America.', ""We have to help parents pass their values along to their children, and they should be reinforced. That's why I fought for more educational television. That's why I fought for a V-chip in new TV's and a rating system so you can control what young children see. Every study shows that too much violence too young numbs children to the meaning of violence and undermines their ability to see other people with dignity and respect. We have to deal with that."", 'That\'s why we fought for the safe and drugfree schools program, and we got more than double the number of children who now see D.A.R.E. officers and others in their schools saying, ""Don\'t do drugs. They will kill you. They will ruin your lives. You deserve a better chance."" We were right to fight for that. That\'s why I fought to stop the big tobacco companies from advertising and marketing cigarettes to children illegally. It was wrong.', ""Now, in every single one of those instances, Senator Dole disagreed with me. That doesn't make him a bad person, but I think I'm right, and I think he was wrong about that. And you have to decide who you think is right."", 'I believe we\'ve got to keep our streets safe. I know it was unpopular in Nevada when we passed the crime bill and the Brady bill. I know a lot of people in the rural parts of this State were told, ""There they go again, those crazy Democrats and that awful President. They\'re going to take guns away from hunters and sports people."" Well, you know something? I grew up in a State where more than half the people have a hunting or a fishing license or both. I was shooting a .22 at old tin cans when I was 12. But we don\'t need assault weapons on our street. They\'re designed to kill people. They\'re designed to kill people.', ""And that's just like a lot of this stuff. That's what they said 2 years ago, but now we know. We've got a record. Not a single Nevada sportsman has lost a weapon, but 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers didn't get handguns because of the Brady bill."", ""We're putting more police on our streets— this is unbelievable—if we keep going until we get all 100,000 police on the street, instead of 4 years of declining crime we'll have 8 years of declining crime. We might actually be able to feel safe again in every community in this country."", ""Here again my opponent voted against 100,000 police. Senator Coffin's opponent voted to eliminate it, even in the evidence—in the face of the evidence that the crime rate was coming down, they voted to stop doing it. I don't understand it. But that's one reason, when I was in Arizona this morning before I came here, that Bill Bratton, the former commissioner of police in New York City and Boston—and in New York City, because of community policing, because they put more police on the street, they brought the crime rate down 39 percent and the murder rate down 50 percent—and he endorsed Bill Clinton and Al Gore because he knows we ought to finish the job of putting 100,000 police on the street. And I want you to help us do it."", ""I believe, as strongly as I can say, that we need to do these things block by block, community by community. We have to work together to make the American dream work. That's why I wanted someone like Nell Justice to introduce me, someone who has taken responsibility for her children, someone who's active in her community."", ""I don't believe that the President for a moment can take full credit for any of the achievements that I've talked to you about. But it is the job of the President to do those things which we should do together as a country. And it is the job of the President to imagine the future and to try to lead the country into a better, brighter future in a way that is consistent with our values."", ""What we have here in America today is an old-fashioned partnership. We're out working today to mobilize another million volunteers to work with police officers in their neighborhoods because we know community citizen groups can drive the crime rate down. I've asked a million volunteers a year to join with us to make sure every 8-year-old can read independently by the third grade. These are things we have to do together."", ""But how we do it, what we do in Washington determines whether you can do it here. So you have to decide, do we want to balance the budget as I want to and still protect Medicare, Medicaid, education, the environment, technology? Or do we want to do what they want to do, which is to promise you a big tax cut that will blow a hole in the deficit, actually raise taxes on 9 million working people and will require bigger cuts in the environment, in education, in Medicare and Medicaid than the ones I vetoed? There's a big difference here. It's just an honest difference of opinion. I say balance the budget, protect our values, invest in our future."", ""Do we want to keep reforming health care step by step? We've made a good start. My balanced budget plan—which cannot be funded by them—my balanced budget plan will help families that are between jobs keep their health insurance for 6 months, add another million children to the rolls of those with health insurance, provide free mammograms to women on Medicare. And for the over 1 1/2 million families that are courageously out there caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's, it will give them some respite care. That is hard duty, and that's important, and we can do it. I think we ought to do it. Will you help us do that? [Applause]"", ""And let me say this, especially to the young people: The two biggest differences, the two biggest choices you have to make—the first is about education. I am telling you, I would not be here today, no way in the world would I be here today—I was born to a widowed mother in a little town in Arkansas; she married my stepfather, who did not have a high school diploma—if it hadn't been for my family drumming into me the importance of education and for the opportunities I was given, I wouldn't be here today. I know every politician stands up, loves to give speeches about self-reliance. Well, the woman who introduced me is selfreliant. But we all need a hand, too."", ""Every politician would like you to believe that he or she was born in a log cabin they built by themselves. [Laughter] But that's just not true, folks. Educational opportunity is the gift we give not only to our children but to ourselves, to give us a country that can be free and strong and that can grow and go forward together. And we have a lot still to do. Here's how we're going to teach every 8-year-old to read, and 40 percent of them can't do it. We're going to mobilize 30,000 AmeriCorps volunteers and reading specialists to go across this country and get a million others."", 'One of the things that we did this year I\'m very proud of is to allocate 200,000 more workstudy slots to college students in the years ahead than we\'ve had. And I want 100,000 of those— 100,000, half of them, to be given to college students who say, ""If you\'ll give me work-study money, I\'ll go teach an 8-year-old to read."" And I want you to help me do that.', 'I want us to hook up every classroom and library in every school in America to the information superhighway, to the Internet, to the World Wide Web. I want every child for the first time in the history of this country, whether in a poor district, a remote rural district, a middle class or a wealthy one, every child for the first time to have access to the same information in the same way at the same time. It will revolutionize education in America.', ""And I want to open the doors of college education to every single American. I want you to help me make community college, at least 2 years of education after high school, as universal as a high school diploma is today. And it will be easy to do. It will be easy to do. Just let people deduct dollar for dollar from their tax bill the cost of the typical community college tuition. I want to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without any tax penalty if the money's used for education or health care or homebuying. And I believe we should give families a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year for the cost of any college tuition, undergraduate, graduate, at any school, for people of any age. And I can pay for it."", 'Now, they believe that—their education agenda is to abolish the Department of Education.', 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. You think about this: Two cents on the dollar at the Department of Education goes to administration—or bureaucracy, if you want to use the disparaging term; 98 cents of it goes to help educate our children. What would it say to the world if America, the greatest democracy in the world, were to start the 21st century with no one at the President's Cabinet to speak up for the education of our children? I say, no.

And instead of working together to build a prosperous future, they preferred to slaughter one another.', 'That is why I was so upset when hatred of the Federal Government led to the tragedy of Oklahoma City. That is why, when the churches were being burned, the synagogues defaced, the Muslim centers being defaced, I said, that is not my America. We must stand against it strong and hard.', ""When the First Lady and our daughter and I went to open the Olympics for the United States in Atlanta, it was one of the great moments of the last 4 years for us, and I was filled with pride as I looked at those people from 197 different national groups walking around the Olympic Stadium and thinking, you know, we've got folks from all those places here in America; we've got people from everywhere here."", ""So I say to you, this is important, too. We cannot say, you're on your own.

If we had more people doing the job, we'd be in less trouble than we are in. And almost all families are having some trouble raising their kids and doing their jobs. Even well-to-do people often find terrible conflicts between the demands of their work and the demands of children, so you know how much harder it is for people that are just struggling to get by.

What would I like my country to be like when my children are my age?', ""I know what I want. I want the American dream alive for every person who's willing to work for it. I want America to keep being the strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity in the entire world, even if we have to make some controversial decisions to help end wars like Bosnia or throw dictators out of Haiti or continue to move forward in other areas. I know I've been criticized for some of the things I've tried to do, but I know that there are no Russian missiles pointed at the children of America for the first time since the dawn of the cold war. And I want an America that is coming together instead of being torn apart. All around the world people are being divided by race, by religion, by ethnicity, by tribe, killing each other and each other's children because they cannot get along. Look in this crowd today. In this crowd we say, you can be an American; it doesn't matter who you are, where you're from, anything else about you. You've just got to believe in our values, obey the law, and do a good job."", ""Now, we have followed a simple strategy: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, an American community that includes all. Four years ago, the people of California, in very difficult conditions, took that strategy on faith. Today there is a record. You don't have to take our word for it when you see the differences in our vision, that we want to build a bridge to the 21st century; they want to build a bridge to the past. They want to say, you're on your own; we want to say, to use the words of my best friend and someone I'm reasonably close to, it does take a village to raise a child and to build a future."", ""Now we know which side is right. Over the last 4 years, incomes have been rising, jobs have been coming in, the average family income has gone up $1,600 after inflation in the last 2 years alone. We've had the largest drop in child poverty in 20 years; the largest drop in inequality among working people in 27 years; the lowest rates of unemployment, inflation, and home mortgages in 27 years; the highest rates of homeownership in 15 years; record rates of new businesses formed every year, including new businesses owned by women and minorities. We are moving in the right direction."", 'The crime rate has gone down for 4 years in a row and, in the Nation as a whole, is at a 10-year low. The welfare rolls have been reduced by 1.9 million. Child support collections are up 50 percent, $4 billion a year for deserving children all across America. We are moving in the right direction.', ""In the closing days of the last Congress, we raised the minimum wage for 10 million people. We said to 25 million people—25 million people—you can't have your health insurance taken away from you anymore just because you changed jobs or someone in your family has been sick. We said that insurance companies can no longer force hospitals to kick mothers and newborn babies out of the hospitals in 24 hours."", ""We gave more help to small businesses, every one in the country, making them eligible for tax cuts if they invest more in their businesses. We helped people get health insurance if they self-insure by giving them greater tax benefits for doing that. We helped people to take out pensions and to carry with them from job to job if they work for small businesses. We're moving in the right direction."", ""We gave families who will adopt a child— and there are so many out there who need adoption—a $5,000 tax credit. We are moving this country in the right direction. And we had the biggest increase in Pell Grants in 20 years and added 200,000 work-study positions to the Federal Government's efforts to help people go to college."", 'Just a few days ago, we learned that our annual growth is about 3 percent; that real incomes are rising at about 5 percent, which is a very healthy rate after 20 years of virtual stagnation; that we have the highest rates of new investment in our country, almost 19 percent, since President Kennedy was President.', 'We have protected the air, the water, the land. We set aside in the Mojave Desert the biggest natural reserves south of Alaska in the history of America with three national parks, converted the Presidio to a national park, set aside 1.7 million acres in southern Utah in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, moved to save Yellowstone Park from a gold mine, and helped to protect the environment. And we stopped our friends on the other side when they tried to lift the ban on offshore drilling.', 'Now, during this whole campaign, a lot of interesting things have happened. I told someone yesterday and the day before, my opponent, Senator Dole, said that we had the worst economy in America in 20 years, but just 2 weeks before that he said we had the worst economy in 100 years. [Laughter] So I think he made the case for reelection; not everyone can make up 80 years in 2 weeks.', ""Now, the truth is, back in February he admitted we had the best economy in America in 30 years. And you know California, while we've still got a long way to go, is way better off than it was 4 years ago. We are moving in the right direction."", 'And today we got some more good news. Unemployment held steady at 5.2 percent in the country, 210,000 new jobs in October. That makes 10.7 million new jobs in America since I took the oath of office. We are moving in the right direction.', ""It is time for my opponent and those on the other side to stop all this doom-and-gloom talk about America. In spite of what he wants you to think, when it comes to the economy, the sky is not falling. The sky is the limit, and we're going after it."", ""But this election should be about what else we have to do to build our common bridge to the 21st century. And I'd like to ask you all to sort of ride along with me for a moment and let me discuss an issue that hasn't been discussed enough in this campaign, and that is whether we will reform our system of politics by finally passing meaningful campaign finance reform legislation."", 'When I ran for President 4 years ago, I said I wanted to give our Government back to the people. I wanted a Government to represent the national interests, not narrow interests, a Government that would stand up for ordinary Americans. And I have worked hard to do that. When I became President, I barred top officials from ever representing foreign Governments when they leave our service. I barred top officials from lobbying their own agencies for 5 years after leaving office. The days of the revolving door, when top trade negotiators left to work for the very countries they were negotiating against, are over.', 'We passed the most sweeping lobby reform legislation in 50 years. From now on, professional lobbyists must disclose for whom they work, what they are spending, and what bills they are trying to pass or kill—for the first time ever. I challenged the Congress to ban gifts from lobbyists, and they did that.', 'We passed a line item veto so Presidents can strip special-interest pork in general legislation. We passed the motor-voter law, which has enabled millions of people to register more easily and will add millions to the voting rolls next Tuesday. We passed the Congressional Accountability Act and then the White House accountability act to apply to Congress and the White House the same laws that we pass and impose on everyone else in America.', 'All these actions will serve to make Washington work better for you. But there is still more to do, and special interests still have too much say. We have clearly one more big job to do: curbing the power that special interests have in our elections. Everybody knows the problems of campaign money today. There is too much of it. It takes too much time to raise. And it raises too many questions.', 'The parties are engaged in an escalating arms race. In the past 2 years—listen to this—in the past 2 years, the Democratic Party and its House and Senate campaign committees have raised $241 million. The Republican Party and its Senate and House campaign committees have raised $399 million. Raising that much money strains the political system. We have played by the rules, but I know and you know we need to change the rules.', 'I proposed a tough campaign finance bill when I came into office, but the Congress would not pass it. The Republicans have been reluctant to give up their access to big money. Led by my opponent, they filibustered the bill I proposed to death. In fact, campaign finance reform has come before the Congress six Congresses in a row, and my opponent filibustered it five times. He blocked the last one right before he left office.', ""In 1995, I met with Speaker Gingrich at a townhall meeting in New Hampshire. And when we were there a citizen asked us if we would create a bipartisan commission to come up with a campaign finance reform proposal that we would then try to pass. We both agreed. I thought it offered a real chance for bipartisanship and action. And frankly, I was excited about it. I even appointed two distinguished citizens, John Gardner and Doris Kearns Goodwin, to help get it started. But the Republicans walked away. My opponent now says he would support such a commission. But when we had a real chance to succeed, he wouldn't help us start it."", ""Now we have a chance—we had a chance to take bipartisan politics—or partisan politics out of this issue this year as well. I supported a strong bipartisan bill introduced by one of my opponent's strongest supporters, Senator John McCain, and Senator Fred Thompson and Democratic Senator Russ Feingold from Wisconsin. They've got a good approach. It's based on principles I advocated back in 1992. We should curb the power of special interests by restricting political action committees and dramatically reducing the amount they can give to candidates. We should ban contributions from lobbyists to those who lobby. That's what I believe. We should end the big money contributions to political parties known today as soft money. We should ban corporations and unions from directly giving to parties to help Federal candidates they can no longer help directly. And for the first time ever, we should restrict the virtually unlimited amount of money individuals can now give to parties. We should set voluntary spending limits for candidates. And we should give free TV time so that all candidates who observe the voluntary limits—but only those who observe the voluntary limits—can talk directly to voters."", ""And parenthetically, I might say we made a beginning on that approach this year, and I would like to thank those networks which offered Senator Dole and me the opportunity to speak directly to the voters at various times in 90-second or 2-minute messages. I thought that was a very good public service. It's the beginning of seeing how we might do it on a sustained, regular, disciplined basis, because we have to have access to the voters and if you have to purchase it all, it is extremely expensive. So the voluntary spending limits and the free time must work together."", 'This is a good approach. It was endorsed by Common Cause and every other major reform group. It was bipartisan. It was tough. It was real reform. But my opponent opposed it. He refused to bring it to the floor for a vote. And after he left Congress to run for President, the Republican leaders finally allowed the legislation to come to a vote, and then they killed it.', ""There is one more issue that reform must deal with. Today it is legal for both parties to receive contributions from corporations that are completely owned by foreign corporations or interests and from individuals who live in the United States legally but are not citizens. Many of them have lived here many years and have employees and interests in this country. The Democratic Party has raised money this way, and so has the Republican Party. In fact, the Republican Party has raised much more money in this way than the Democrats, but that's not the point. It's time to end this practice as well."", 'Now, McCain-Feingold would end all corporate contributions, so it would take care of that part of the problem. But we should also end contributions to either party from individuals who are not citizens. There are many immigrants who play an important role in our country, and all of you in California know I have done my best to defend legal immigration and the rich contribution it makes to the United States of America. But if the essence of a democracy is its citizens decide, and only citizens can vote, then I believe only citizens should be able to contribute. That is not anti-immigrant, it is simply stating the fact: Those who vote should finance the elections that they vote in.', ""There is no more excuse for waiting. I tried to form a commission, but now is not the time for a commission. This is a time for action. Once again, I call upon the Congress to enact real reform. Delay will only help those who don't want to change at all. When McCain and Feingold introduce their bill next year, I will introduce it with them. Real reform will mean a Government that is more representative, not less. And I ask you, every one of you, to help us to pass real, meaningful campaign finance reform in Washington. Will you do that? [Applause]"", ""Now, let me say one other thing. We should also understand that in a recent case the Supreme Court has made it impossible to enforce some of the strictest limits. And this bill will not solve all of our problems. Even as it establishes limits, it will still allow, because of the Supreme Court's decisions, a millionaire or a billionaire to spend endless sums running for office. It may be that further measures are needed. But in the meantime, that's not an excuse to do what we can. We must act, and we must act now."", ""Let me also say to you that your vote will decide a lot of things in this election. It's far bigger than President Clinton or Senator Dole, even bigger than Congressman Capps or Congresswoman Seastrand. This election is really about how we are going to proceed into the 21st century as a people. Your vote will decide, for example, whether we keep the economy growing by balancing the budget while protecting our investments in education, the environment, and research and technology and Medicare and Medicaid or whether we adopt an even more radical version of the budget I vetoed that will blow a hole in the deficit, raise taxes on 9 million people, and require bigger cuts than the ones that I vetoed last time."", ""Your vote will decide what we do about helping families to balance the demands of work and childrearing, the biggest challenge many families face. I'm proud of the fact that we passed the Family and Medical Leave Act and let 12 million people take some time off from work when a baby was born or someone in their family was sick."", ""Now, this is an honest difference between the two parties. My opponent led the opposition to it, said this year it was still a mistake. Well, we have some evidence now. Twelve million times it's been used, and during that time we've had record new business formation and 10.7 million new jobs. The reason is, America is stronger economically with happy, productive people in the workplace who aren't worried sick about their children at home. That's why."", ""I'd like to see us expand family leave. I think people ought to be able to take a little time off from work to go see their children's teachers twice a year or take their kids to regular doctor's appointments. I believe people who earn overtime and have problems in the family, a sick spouse, a sick child, a sick parent—I think people who earn overtime ought to have the right to decide whether to take the overtime in money or time with the family. We'll be a stronger country with a stronger economy when people feel better about fulfilling their responsibilities to their family members. And I want you to help me do that. Walter Capps will. Will you help us? [Applause]"", ""We passed the beginning of health care reform, but our balanced budget would help people who are between jobs keep health insurance for their families for 6 months. It would add another million people to the ranks of insured— children. It would work with States to add another 2 million working families to the ranks of insured. There are still too many people without insurance. It would give free mammograms to women on Medicare. It would give help for respite care for the over 1 1/2 million families that are struggling nobly and bravely and humanely to care for a family member with Alzheimer's. Our budget pays for it; theirs doesn't. Will you help us do that? [Applause]"", 'We passed the V-chip for new television sets, got a TV rating system voluntarily developed by the entertainment industry, secured an agreement for 3 more hours of educational television, doubled the amount of funds going into the safe and drug-free schools program, and for the first time ever took action to stop the big tobacco companies from advertising and marketing tobacco to children.', 'Now, on the V-chip, on the safe and drugfree schools program which has helped so many children to stay away from drugs and trouble, and on the tobacco issue, my opponent disagrees. All these things can still be reversed. I think we need them as building blocks in our bridge. Will you help me keep them and do them into the 21st century? [Applause]', 'We passed the Brady bill, the assault weapons ban, a bill to put 100,000 police on the streets, ""three strikes and you\'re out."" Our opponents, Senator Dole and the Speaker, they led the fight against that crime bill. And now they don\'t understand why every major law enforcement organization, for the first time ever, has endorsed the Clinton/Gore ticket for reelection.', ""We know how to lower the crime rate. We've fought for the 100,000 police; Senator Dole led the fight against it. When they won the Congress, they voted to abolish the program, even though the crime rate was going down. Then they tried to cut the program. We've only funded half of those police officers, and I'd like to finish the job, but you have to help me. Will you do it? [Applause] They actually tried to repeal the assault weapons ban, and Walter Capps' opponent voted to do that."", 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. Now, you know, 2 years ago, frankly, they were just paying a debt 2 years ago. That\'s why a lot of them won. They went out in a lot of these rural districts in places like my home State, where half the people have a hunting or a fishing license or both, and they said, ""There they go again. They\'re going to take your guns away. That\'s what the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban mean.""', ""Well, 2 years later, those same people who voted that way know the truth. Not a single hunter or sportsperson in America has lost a legitimate weapon, but over 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers can't get a handgun because of the Brady bill. And we just extended the Brady bill so that now people who've beat up their spouses and their children can't get it either. And now that we have fought off the attempt to repeal the assault weapons ban, we ought to make sure they don't come back with that. And we ought to ban bullets that are designed for one purpose only, to pierce the bulletproof vests of police officers. They are wrong, and we ought to get rid of them. Will you help us finish this job? [Applause]"", ""We moved a million nine hundred thousand people from welfare to work and passed historic welfare reform legislation that says we will guarantee to poor people, and to the children especially, health care, nutrition, and more child care than ever when people move from welfare to work. But able-bodied people must move within 2 years from welfare to work. But the law doesn't do anything. You can't require people to go to work unless there are jobs for them to take. I have a plan to create another million jobs to help move people from welfare to work. Will you help us implement that plan? [Applause]"", ""There is much more to do on the environment. A lot of these plans for these national parks and other preserves are just beginning. We have to finish the job. We cleaned up more toxic waste sites in 3 years than they did in 12. But we still have 10 million kids living within 4 miles of toxic sites. We'll clean up the 500 worst ones. We want to be able to say in the 21st century, all our children can grow up next to parks, not poison. Will you help us do that? [Applause]"", ""And most important of all, your vote will decide—as the president said here when we started—whether we put ourselves squarely on the line for giving every single American access to world-class education. I am proud of the fact that we have increased Head Start; passed the national service program; given schools all over California and the rest of the country opportunities to try new and exciting ways to achieve excellence, like the charter movement; that we passed a new college loan program which lowers the cost of college loans and gives young people a chance to repay them as a percentage of their income so people can never be bankrupted by borrowing the money to go to college. I'm proud of the increase in the Pell grants and 200,000 more work-study positions. But it is just a beginning. There is more we need to do. And I need your help."", 'Forty percent of our 8-year-olds still cannot read independently by the third grade. Part of it is we\'re having a new wave of immigration. A lot of those children\'s first language is not English. But that will be cold comfort for them if they move through school unable to continue to learn. I have a proposal to mobilize AmeriCorps volunteers and 30,000 other reading specialists to go around the country and get a million volunteers to teach our children to read. And I want 100,000 of those 200,000 new work-study slots to go to young college students who say, ""I\'ll go. I\'ll teach young people to read."" Will you help us do that? Will you help us? [Applause]', 'Schools all over America are bursting at the seams with the largest number of children in history. We have the first plan ever to help school districts to build new facilities and repair old ones so our kids have decent learning environments. We have a plan to hook up every classroom and every library in every school in America to the information superhighway by the year 2000. Will you help us do it? [Applause]', ""We do want to say, in 4 years we can make at least 2 years of higher education as universal as a college diploma is today, simply by saying you can deduct from your taxes, dollar for dollar, the cost of the typical community college tuition if you go and make your grades and you're a good citizen. Will you help us do that? [Applause] I want to let families save in an IRA for their retirement but withdraw tax-free if the money's being used for education, health care, or first-time homebuying. Will you help us do that? [Applause] And I believe we should give families a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year for the cost of any college tuition at any level for Americans of any age. Will you help us do that? [Applause] Now, that will build a bridge to the 21st century."", 'And finally let me say, as you look around this vast sea of people today, I ask you to think again of how we are going to do this and whether we are going to practice the politics of division—what some gleefully call wedge issues— or are we going to say, ""We want to go forward together""?', ""Think about how sad it is that in the Holy Land, the home of the world's three great monotheistic religions, people still cannot lay down their hatred of one another. Think how sad it is that in the home of my ancestors, Ireland, full of young, brilliant people bursting at the seams for new opportunity in Northern Ireland, people still cannot lay down their religious differences and their arguments about incidents that occurred centuries ago. Think about how sad it is that in Bosnia, people who are biologically indistinguishable killed one another's children with reckless abandon. Or in Rwanda, Burundi, the Hutus and the Tutsis—both of them with no money, really, to speak of to further their dreams and help their children—instead of cooperating, slaughter each other at record rates."", ""In America we must fight against that. That's why we had to stand against what happened at Oklahoma City. That's why we had to stand against the church burnings and the defacement of synagogues and mosques and Islamic centers. And that's why we have to stand together for a different future."", ""If you want all these things I talked about, in the end it will to some extent be an affair of the American heart. We must be willing to say, I tell you again, that in this country all we need to know about you is whether you embrace our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, our Declaration of Independence; whether you are willing to show up for work or school tomorrow; whether you are willing to give your neighbors the elbow room to pursue their personal lives and their freedom; whether you are willing to treat people, even those with whom you dramatically disagree, with genuine respect if they are law-abiding, hard-working citizens. And we ought to say, if you're that way, we don't need to know anything else about you. You're part of our America, and we're going to build a bridge together to the 21st century."", 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"

I especially am glad to see so many young people here today, for this election is about your future. We are not just ending a century and beginning a new one. You all know that in every place in America we are changing the way we work and live, the way we relate to each other and to the rest of the world.', ""This is a time full of promise and hope and a time full of challenge. This is an election of enormous moment, one with great consequences and, thankfully, one with clear choices: Will we build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past? Do you believe, along with our friends on the other side, that we're all on our own, or do you believe, as the person closest to me once said, it does take a village to raise our children and build our future, and we have to do it together?"", ""That is the choice. Four years ago, I came to Texas and all across the country, along with the Vice President, to say that we wanted to create an America in the 21st century where every person, without regard to race or religion or gender or background or where you start out in life, would have a chance to live up to their God-given abilities if they were responsible enough to work for it; that we wanted an America involved with the world, leading the world for peace and freedom and prosperity; and we wanted an America where all of us, regardless of our backgrounds, have a place at the table and a part in America's community; that we're going to be growing together, not growing apart, as we move into the 21st century."", 'Four years ago, the American people took us on faith. But now there is a record, and the record is clear. Compared to 4 years ago, we have 10.7 million new jobs in America; homeownership is at a 15-year high; unemployment, inflation, and home mortgages together at a 27-year low. We had the biggest drop in child poverty in 20 years. We are moving in the right direction, and we need to keep on going all the way to the 21st century.', ""In our country the crime rate has come down for 4 years in a row and is at its lowest level in 10 years. The welfare rolls have been reduced by nearly 2 million. Child support is up by 50 percent, $4 billion a year. We have improved college loans, lowering the costs and making the repayments easier. We have more children in Head Start. We just added 200,000 work-study positions so more children can go on to college and pay their way through. We raised the minimum wage for 10 million Americans. We made 25 million Americans eligible to keep their health insurance because now it's illegal to take it away when you change jobs or just because someone in your family gets sick. We have stopped the practice of insurance companies all across this country in kicking mothers and their newborn babies out of the hospital after only 24 hours. We are moving in the right direction."", ""It is interesting to me that my opponent says that the country is in terrible shape. Let me ask you this, folks. If a Republican had been President and had reduced the size of the Federal Government to its smallest size since President Kennedy, eliminated more regulations and programs than his 2 predecessors in 12 years, reduced the deficit in all 4 years of his term for the first time in the 20th century, and helped to create an economy in which there were 10.7 million new jobs, do you really believe they would be saying that the sky is falling?

Are we going to keep going forward together or adopt that risky tax scheme that would blow a hole in the deficit, weaken the Texas economy, require bigger cuts than the ones I vetoed last year when they shut the Government down?

Everywhere I go, people of all income groups, even well-to-do people with children, tell me that they're spending more hours at work than ever before and they're concerned about whether they can also be good parents. I hear it everywhere. We have worked hard for the family and medical leave law, and 12 million people took a little time off from work when a baby was born or a family member was sick, without losing their jobs.

Now, I grew up in a State where half the people have a hunting or a fishing license or both. And I saw people in my own State wondering if they were telling the truth. And they won a lot of elections in 1994 with that line—a lot—maybe why they have the House now. They may have made Mr. Gingrich the Speaker of the House telling people we\'re going to take their guns away. But you know, we\'ve had 2 years now, and now we know the truth. In all the State of Texas, as vast and wide as it is, not a single law-abiding hunter or sports person has lost a weapon. But over 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers did not get handguns because of the Brady bill. And now people who beat up their children and their spouses can\'t get them either. And I think we were right. You have to decide.', ""We've got the crime rate coming down for 4 years in a row, the lowest crime rate in 10 years. But you and I know there's still too much violence in our country. We have to do more. We have only funded half of those police officers. We have only done part of what we're trying to do with our children in the schools. But they keep trying to stop us from putting 100,000 police on the street. You have to decide."", ""There's a reason why the Vice President and I were the first team in our party ever to get the endorsement of every major law enforcement group in the entire United States, because we are for the safety of our children. We think every street, every school, every neighborhood should be safe. I think we're right and they're wrong, and I want you to decide and help us build a safe bridge to the 21st century."", ""There are many other issues I would like to talk about. But when I look at this group today I know that they are important to you. I have a plan to move a million people from welfare to work. We passed a welfare reform law that says people who are able-bodied have to go to work within 2 years. But if they're going to go to work, there have to be jobs there. I have a plan to create them. I want you to help me create those jobs. Will you do it? [Applause]"", 'For 4 years, I have asked the Congress to reform the laws of campaign finance. Today again I called for a bipartisan approach to reduce the influence of special interests in politics and give more ordinary citizens like Victor Morales a fighting chance to be heard by the people and elected by the people. Will you help us pass campaign finance reform? [Applause]', 'But most important of all is whether we are committed to giving our people a world-class education, not just some children but all children and all adults who need it. Will you help us do that? [Applause]', 'I have offered the American people a proposal to mobilize one million volunteers to go all across America to work with parents and teachers to make sure that by the year 2000 every single 8-year-old in America can pick up a book and say, ""I can read this all by myself."" Will you help us do it? [Applause]', ""I've asked 100,000 of the new work-study programs for college students be dedicated to young people who will go into our schools and help our children learn to read. Will the young people in this audience pledge to help us do this? Will you help us teach our children to read? [Applause]"", 'I want to hook up every classroom and every library and every school in El Paso and every other community in America to the information superhighway, to the Internet, to the World Wide Web, to make sure that these children, for the very first time in the history of America, will all be able to get the same information in the same way at the same time. It will revolutionize learning in America. Will you help me do that by the year 2000? [Applause]', ""And finally, will you help us open the doors of college education to all Americans? [Applause] Let me tell you, folks, there is no clearer example than learning of what we should be doing together and why our approach is right and theirs is wrong. We are pushing the frontiers of knowledge as never before. In the last 4 years, we discovered two genes that cause breast cancer. It is a matter of time before we're able to detect it early enough to save the life of every woman who is afflicted by it. In the last few months, for the first time ever, laboratory animals with their spines completely severed have recovered movement in their legs because of nerve transplants; it's just a matter of time until we can do that for people. And America should lead the way with learning, and you should support it."", ""But it's not just the scientists, it's everyone. We all need that. I want to open the doors of college education to all Americans by doing three things. Number one, in 4 years we ought to make a community college degree, at least 2 years after high school, as universal as a high school diploma is today. And here's how we're going to do it. I want to let people simply deduct from their taxes, dollar for dollar, the cost of a typical community college tuition. It will help everyone get what they need. I want to let you save in a retirement account but withdraw from it without any penalty if you use the money for a college education or for homebuying or health care costs. And I want every family in this country to be able to deduct up to $10,000 a year for the cost of any kind of college tuition. Let's open the doors to all Americans. Will you help us do that? [Applause] Will you help us in the back? [Applause] Will you help us? [Applause]"", ""My fellow Americans, in these political campaigns, very often the closer you get to the election, the hotter the words get. And there has developed a tendency in the last few years for people to try to say that they don't just disagree with their opponents but their opponents are no good, there's something wrong with them. I personally believe that's a bad development in America. Most of the people, I believe, in this country, of both parties, love our country and only want the best for it. I don't have to say that I dislike the people I'm running against to say I disagree with them honorably."", ""But let me tell you, to me this election is about big, big things. The world is changing. I can't take credit for that. I can't take credit for all the good things that have happened in America. But I do say, we have gone now in the right direction, and together we are making it better. And that's the big question before us today."", ""Just in the last couple of days, I was in Denver, Colorado, at a rally like this—although it was considerably smaller. At the end of the day, I went through the crowd shaking hands as I always do, and let me tell you what I found: I found a young woman who had been a victim of domestic violence, who thanked me for the efforts we were now making with our hotline to help people like her out. I found three women together who had been victimized by breast cancer, who knew that we had broken new ground in medical research. I found a young man who had dropped out but had gone back to college because we've changed the college loan program to make it more affordable. I found a young woman who was a law enforcement officer, thanking me because we have put five more police officers in her community and she felt safer on the beat and thought their children would be safer because of it. Everywhere I go I find this. I found a man who thanked me because he and his wife had just adopted a child and they were able to take a little time off to get used to that baby because of the family and medical leave law."", 'This is what elections are about: How will we change the face of America for the better? How will we make America better? The only thing that matters is what our country will look like when we go into the 21st century.', 'Now, you look around this vast crowd today— I say to you again, we must do this together. So much of the time I have spent as your President in dealing with the problems of the world has been involved with people who hate each other because they are of different religions or races or tribes or ethnic groups. I have seen the people of Bosnia, who are biologically indistinguishable, actually prepared to kill each other and their children. In Ireland, where my people come from, there are still Protestants and Catholics fighting over things that happened hundreds of years ago while the children long for peace and a better future. In Africa today we see again hundreds of thousands of people dislodged because of tribal hatreds that are senseless. None of them have enough to do what they need to do for their children as it is. If they would simply join hands, they could make a bigger, brighter future for everyone, instead of shrinking the future for everyone. I see it everywhere.', ""But America has been different, and America must be different. That's why when people started expressing their hatred of the Federal Government, I stood up for the Federal employees and reminded people they're our friends and neighbors; they're people like Silvestre. They're our neighbors and friends. That's why we stood up to the church burnings and to the people who would deface the mosques and the Muslim centers. We are all in this, and I say you know this instinctively because of where you live and who you are and what your experience is. El Paso, this is, as much as anything else, an election of the heart."", 'And so I say, I want you all to be there. I want you all to be there because you must know the fundamental truth of America: Our best days are still ahead if we do the right things.', 'I want to build a bridge big enough and wide enough for every single one of us to walk across together. Will you help me do it? [Applause] Will you help me? [Applause] Will you do it for your children? [Applause] Will you do it for our future? [Applause]', 'Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you.']"

Ladies and gentlemen, it is wonderful to be back in Las Cruces again after an absence of many years. I don't know how long it's been since a President has been here, but the others didn't know what they were missing. I am glad to be here."", ""I want to thank the Aggie Pride Band for playing for me. Thank you. I thank those who have joined me here on the stage. Senator Bingaman, thank you for your leadership for New Mexico and for America, especially in breaking down the barriers to developing America's high technology and creating jobs for all these young people that are getting an education here. Thank you, Bill Richardson, for helping me to lead the fight against what Speaker Gingrich and the Congressman from this district tried to do to the Federal budget, to the American people, and to our future, and for leading the cause of world peace. Thank you."", ""I thank Governor Bruce and Alice King. I thank Senator Mary Jane Garcia. She did get me to promise to come here, and I did not want to incur her wrath. [Laughter] So I'm glad to be here. Senate candidate Art Trujillo, New Mexico college Democratic president Julie Ward—didn't she do a great job? Give her another hand; give her a hand. She was great. [Applause] You know, even if you've got a lot of self-confidence, it's hard to stand up in front of 35,000 people or however many we have— maybe more way back there in the back. I can't see; I hope you can hear us. But Julie Ward did this school proud and the young people of America proud. Give her another hand; she was great. [Applause]"", ""I thank Mayor Ruben Smith for welcoming me here, and your attorney general, Tom Udall; State Corporations Commissioner Eric Serna; Democratic chair Earl Potter; and all the others who are up here. And President Orenduff, thank you for making me feel so welcome here. I was glad to be coming before I saw you; I'm ecstatic now. This is an amazing story. I want to say to all of you——"", 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. Thank you. I want to say to all of you, we are about to vote in the last Presidential election of the 20th century, for the first President of the 21st century. All of you know that we are living through a period of enormous change in how we work and live, how we relate to each other and the rest of the world, how we're becoming more diverse, how people will have more possibilities than ever before, how we have more challenges that are different. All these changes are coming. The real question is, how are we responding?"", ""I have worked hard for 4 years to create America's best future for all of you in the 21st century, to create a country in which everybody—Latino, African-American, Irish-American, Polish-American, Asian-American, you name it—all Americans who are willing to work for it can live out their dreams, an America still standing fast for freedom and peace and security and prosperity all over the world, an America in which we are building an American community of all our people together. And we are better off than we were 4 years ago because we've been pursuing that course."", 'There is a very different vision being presented in all honesty and candor by my opponent and the leaders of the other party. I believe we have to build a bridge to the future big enough and strong enough for us to all walk across together. He said he wanted to reach back and build a bridge to the past.', 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. They believe there's something inherently oppressive about the American people deciding to do things together that we can't do on our own. And they think you're better off being told you're on your own. I believe the First Lady was right when she wrote it takes a village to raise our children and build our future. That's what I believe."", 'Audience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!', ""The President. But you have to decide. Four years ago, I came to New Mexico and the people voted for the Vice President, Al Gore, and me and gave us a chance to serve. Four years ago, you took me on faith and the word of my friends in New Mexico, including many who are on this stage. Now there is a record, and we know the difference. We have a record. My opponent has a record. The leaders of his party in Congress have a record. We know what has happened in our country when our policies have been put into effect. We know that they said my economic program would wreck the economy and increase the deficit. But we've reduced the deficit in all 4 years of a President's term for the first time in the 20th century. Incomes are up after 10 years of stagnation; homeownership at a 15-year high; the deficit at a 15-year low; the combined rates of unemployment, inflation, and home mortgages at a 27-year low; child poverty, the biggest drop in 20 years; and 10.7 million new jobs. Our approach is right, and theirs is not. The evidence shows it. There is evidence."", ""When I offered the American people a tough crime bill to put 100,000 police on the street and take drugs and gangs and guns off the street, the other guys, they said the 100,000 police would never happen, it would do no good, and all I wanted to do was to take away weapons from sportsmen and women. Well, they got a lot of votes saying that, but that was 2 years ago. Now we know. We've had 4 years of declining crime rates, the lowest crime rate in America in a decade. Not a single sportsman or woman has lost a weapon, but 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers couldn't get handguns because of the Brady bill, or assault weapons. It was the right thing to do."", ""Now, there are a lot of other good things that have happened: almost 2 million fewer people on the welfare rolls; child support collections up 50 percent, $4 billion a year. That is what we have tried to do. We raised the minimum wage for 10 million Americans. Twenty-five million Americans have been told now you can't have your health insurance just taken away from you because you changed jobs or someone in your family gets sick. We passed a bill that said that no more can mothers and their newborns be kicked out of the hospital after 24 hours by the insurance companies. We passed legislation to help small-business people take out pensions and afford health care. We gave a $5,000 tax credit to families that will adopt a child that needs a home, and I hope more people do as a result of it. We're moving this country in the right direction."", ""Now, there's something else I had to do in the last 4 years—really, in the last year—that Jeff Bingaman and Bill Richardson had to help me with. When our friends in the other party won the Congress, they got to try to put their vision into effect. Their vision was a budget which cut Medicare 3 times more than the trustees said was necessary to stabilize it and ran the risk of creating a system in which the oldest, the poorest, and the sickest of our seniors were left behind. Their budget would have ended a 30-year guarantee that we as Americans have made to the poorest children, to our seniors in nursing homes, to families who have family members with disabilities that we'll help them with health care. Their budget contained the first cut in education in modern history, cutting everything from Head Start to student loans and Pell grants."", 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. Their budget would have paralyzed our ability to protect the environment and to continue to advance the cause of environmental protection while growing the economy. And to boot, they raised taxes on 8 million of our hardest pressed working people and authorized corporations to raid their workers' pension funds after we should have learned in the eighties that we shouldn't raid our pension funds, we should protect them. That's what I've worked to do."", 'That was their budget. And I vetoed it, and they shut the Government down with no thought to the consequences. And they said, ""Oh, the Democrats will cave."" And I said, ""I\'d a lot rather see the American people inconvenienced for 3 or 4 weeks than hurt for 30 or 40 years. We will not cave. This is wrong.""', 'Now, you have another decision to make. And you have to decide what you believe because you have in this district a Member of Congress who voted right down the lines on those issues with the Speaker of the House. They even voted to repeal the commitment to put 100,000 police on the street. It was unbelievable. They voted to repeal the national standards to guarantee quality health care in our nursing homes.', ""Now, I don't think you have to believe that the people who did this are bad people. I think they honestly believe that there's nearly nothing we should do together; you're better off on your own. But you do have an alternative, someone who believes that we ought to go forward together, Shirley Baca. And I hope you'll help her go to Congress."", ""Now, here we are at the end of this election, and we found out today that we got another 200,000 jobs this month. That brings it to 10.7 million new jobs since I took office. Any my opponent says we've got the worst economy in 20 years."", 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', ""The President. Now—don't boo. Just 2 weeks ago, he said we had the worst economy in 100 years. So he's made an argument for my reelection. After all, how many people can make up 80 years in 2 weeks? I appreciate that. I appreciate that."", ""The truth is he was right earlier this year when he said we had the best economy in 30 years. But we all know that there is more to do. We all know that we're not exactly where we ought to be if we're going into the 21st century with everybody having an opportunity to make the most of their own lives, with all citizens acting responsibly, with America coming together closer and closer as an American community."", 'Your vote will decide the direction of this country. In a matter of enormous consequence, you have a clear choice between people who honestly believe in what they are advocating.', ""You have to decide whether they're right to offer a big election year tax cut that would blow a hole in the deficit, require even bigger cuts than the ones I vetoed last year, and raise taxes again on 8 million hard-pressed working people, or whether you like my plan to balance the budget, invest in Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment, and give families targeted tax cuts we can afford."", 'You have to decide. You have to decide whether Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich were right when they opposed the family and medical leave law as an unwarranted burden on business, or whether I was right to say I think the most important challenge most families have to meet is how they can do their jobs and then do their number one job at home in raising their children. I believe, in a world where more and more parents are working, where the American people are spending more hours at work today than they were 25 years ago, there is nothing more important than giving people the security of knowing that they can succeed at their most important job—raising their kids—and still do well at work.', ""Now you have some evidence. We passed the family and medical leave law over their opposition. And 3 1/2 years later, over 12 million Americans have used it when a baby was born or a family member was sick. We've had record numbers of new small businesses, record numbers of new businesses owned by women and minorities, and 10.7 million new jobs, a faster job growth rate than under any administration of the other party since the 1920's. We were right. We were right."", ""And I believe we ought to expand the family and medical leave law to say people can have a little time off from work to go see their children's teachers twice a year and take them to doctor's appointments. I believe we ought to strengthen our families by continuing to improve health care. In their budget plan, because they blow a hole in the deficit and require bigger cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, they can't do anything to deal with the remaining challenges of health care. Under our plan we will add another million children to the ranks of the insured—I might say, something terribly important because Hispanic families' children are the most likely not to have insurance for health care even though they are working. It's important to put more children in the ranks of health insured, and I intend to do it."", ""Our plan will help families when they're between jobs to keep their health insurance for 6 months. Our plan will provide free mammograms to women on Medicare. Our plan will provide respite care to help those 1.7 million families who are struggling honorably and lovingly to care for a family member with Alzheimer's. Our plan will do that, balance the budget, and pay for targeted tax cuts. I hope you'll help us pass our plan on Tuesday."", 'There are many other things your vote will decide on Tuesday: whether we continue and finish the job of putting 100,000 police on the street; whether we continue to try to protect our children from the dangers of guns and gangs and drugs and tobacco by supporting the safe and drug-free schools act, by supporting the 100,000 police, by supporting the first administration ever to say we have got to stop the tobacco companies from marketing and selling cigarettes to children illegally. You will decide.', ""You will decide whether we continue to move people from welfare to work, not only by passing the law which I signed which requires ablebodied people to move from a welfare check to a paycheck in 2 years but which acknowledges that you cannot require people to take work if the work isn't there. We've got to create those jobs for the people to have. We have a strategy to do it; you will decide."", 'You will decide whether at long last and after 4 years of effort we will finally pass meaningful campaign finance reform to reduce the influence of huge financial interests in political campaigns that cost too much and undermine the confidence of the American people. You will decide.', ""You will decide whether we continue to make the water clearer, the food purer, the air cleaner, whether we continue to preserve our most precious natural resources or whether we say, as they do, every time you protect the environment you hurt the economy. We have proved with cleaner air, safer food, safer drinking water, protecting our natural heritage that we can grow the economy while preserving the environment. And in the 21st century the only way you'll be able to grow the economy over the long run is to preserve the natural heritage of the United States of America. But you must decide."", ""Most of all you must decide whether you believe we are going to give the same access to world-class education to all of our children. You must decide. I am very, very proud of this administration's work in education, expanding Head Start, raising standards, promoting reform, passing national service, lowering the cost of college loans and improving their repayment, increasing Pell grants by the largest amount in 20 years, adding 200,000 new work-study grants. I'm proud of that, but there is more to do."", ""You will decide. You will decide whether we're going to teach every 8-year-old in the country to read by the third grade by the 21st century; 40 percent of them can't now. I want to mobilize a million volunteers, including 100,000 of those 200,000 new students who will get work-study money to go to college. Will you help me teach the 8-year-olds in New Mexico to read? [Applause]"", ""You will decide—you will decide whether we hook up every classroom and library and every school in America to the information superhighway, to guarantee that for the first time in history—whether children live in the poorest rural areas, in the poorest inner cities, in the suburban or big city school district; whether they're rich, middle class, or poor; whether they're Hispanic, white, Native American, African-American, or you-name-it—for the first time, we've got a chance to make sure every child in America in every classroom gets the same information in the same way in the same time at a world-class level. We can do it. It will revolutionize education. You will decide."", 'You will decide—you will decide whether for the first time we truly open the doors of college to every American. I want to do three things. Number one, I want to make at least 2 years of education after high school as universal as a high school diploma is today. And we can do it. We can do it simply by saying people can deduct dollar for dollar from their tax bill the cost of a typical community college tuition for 2 years. I want to give families the opportunity to save in retirement accounts and withdraw from them with no tax penalty if the money is used for health care, homebuying, or sending a child to college. And something that will affect virtually all of you—I want families to be able to deduct up to $10,000 a year for the cost of college tuition at any college in the country, undergraduate or graduate, for people of any age.', 'But you must decide. You must decide. And more than anything else, you have to decide how we\'re going to get there. They say, ""There\'s a tough world out there, but there\'s a lot of opportunity. So if you can go down in the valley, cross the rushing river, and climb the mountain, I wish you well."" I say we\'ll all be better off if we roll up our sleeves and build a bridge to the 21st century big enough, wide enough, and strong enough for all of us to walk across together. Will you help?

I'm delighted to see his parents here, and I'm glad Mary Alice came. And I want the people of San Antonio to know you would have been so proud every day of them for the last 4 years. I go places all over America, far from San Antonio; mayors, people who build housing, people who work in law enforcement come up to me and spontaneously say, Henry Cisneros is the finest Secretary of HUD we have ever had in the history of the United States. Everywhere they say it."", 'I was in Miami the other day, and a man said to me, ""There are hundreds of people who are no longer homeless. You could walk down streets at night that used to be littered with people spending the night. They aren\'t there anymore because we had a dream and an idea and Secretary Cisneros supported us and we took the homeless people off the street.""', 'I was in the another part of the country the other day, and people said, ""We were absolutely overwhelmed with substandard public housing infested with gangs and guns and drugs.

I wanted to come here because I have such vivid memories of this place. Twenty-four years ago, I remember, in October, Congressman Gonzalez and I, when I was a very young man, on a Saturday morning like this, after we'd had a dinner at the Menger Hotel, got Congressman Hale Boggs up in the morning, and he got on a plane and flew to Alaska, to his death. There was something in your local paper about it."", ""I have vivid memories of all the times I have ever been here. I remember in 1992 when I came here, and then along toward the end of the campaign, some of my friends from Texas put about $200 worth of that mango ice cream on my plane, and we all ate it until we couldn't walk. I got a little to take with me today, too. [Laughter]"", 'I remember so many things. But this place, the Alamo, has always symbolized to me the transformation of Texas, the transformation of America, and the best hope for our future. The Alamo is not just a place of great personal courage, it is a place of great standoff in the beginning between two nations and two peoples. And the story of the Alamo over the last 160 years and the story of San Antonio is the story of the reconciliation and friendships between two great nations and two great peoples here in Texas and throughout the United States. It is a great, great story.', 'We represent people who believe that by working together and helping each other we can all do better. Franklin Roosevelt, as Henry reminded me this morning, built your wonderful Riverwalk during the Great Depression. Lyndon Johnson did teach in Cotulla, not very far from here, where he learned what it was like to be poor and Mexican-American.', 'We have always come out of a tradition that believed that if we worked together to give each other the tools—not a guarantee but a chance— to make the most of our own lives, this country could move closer to its ideals and we would all be better off than if we just said, ""You\'re on your own."" When we come together and search for common ground we are always, always stronger as a nation. There is nothing we can\'t do.', 'Now, in 3 days before this election, I really believe more than anything else what is left is not about the evidence, it\'s about the attitude. It\'s not so much about the mind as it is about the heart. You know, 4 years ago, Al Gore and I asked you to take a chance on us when we said, ""We\'re going to change the direction of this country. We\'re sick of the politics of division in Washington. We want to create more opportunity for everybody, demand more responsibility from everybody, and create an American community of everybody, where everybody\'s got a role to play and a place at the table."" You just took a chance; you didn\'t know. But now we have a record.', 'Four years ago, we had high unemployment, widespread frustration, rising crime, increasing family breakdown, rising welfare rolls, fears, hatred, and people had given up on being able to do anything about any of our problems. I was determined to start a new direction for this country, to stop pointing fingers and say, ""Here\'s my hand. I don\'t care whether you\'re a Democrat or Republican or what you are. If you will work with me to make this country a better place, I\'ll work with you, but we\'ve got to take along everybody. We\'ve got to give every single person a chance.""', ""Now, you didn't know; you just took a chance. But look at the evidence. We have 10.7 million new jobs in America; 5.2 percent unemployment; rising incomes for the first time in a decade. The deficit has gone down in all 4 years for the first time in the 20th century, down 63 percent. Homeownership is at a 15-year high. We have nearly 2 million fewer people on welfare. Child support collections are up 50 percent across the country. The crime rate has gone down for 4 years in a row; it's at a 10-year low all across America. We raised the minimum wage for 10 million people. We've protected people from losing their health insurance if they've been sick or somebody in their family has been sick or they changed jobs. We said hospitals can't kick mothers and newborn babies out of the hospital after only 24 hours anymore. Twelve million people took advantage of the family and medical leave law and got to take a little time off from work when a baby was born or a family member was sick without losing their jobs. This country is in better shape than it was 4 years ago. We are moving in the right direction."", ""Let me ask you something—this is an affair of the mind and the heart. When it was published yesterday that we had 210,000 new jobs in America, my opponent said we've got the worst economy in 20 years. [Laughter] I tell you what, I'll take that bet. I ask every person in Texas who believes it is the worst economy in 20 years to vote for Senator Dole, and every person who knows better to vote for me. I'll gladly take the results of the election in Texas."", ""Now, just 2 weeks ago, my opponent said that we had the worst economy in 100 years. [Laughter] So I think he's campaigning for me now. I mean, after all, who else could make up 80 years in 2 weeks? I think we're doing pretty well."", 'All this is not a matter of the evidence. What do you think the Republicans would be saying if they had a President who had presided over an administration that had cut the deficit by 63 percent, that had the highest job growth rate of any Republican administration in 70 years, that had the lowest average unemployment in 20 years, the lowest average inflation in 30 years, the biggest decline in income inequality among working people in 27 years, the lowest combined rates of unemployment and inflation since Lyndon Johnson was President 28 years ago? If they had a record like that, what do you think they\'d be saying? They\'d be saying, ""It is morning in America."" [Laughter] They\'d be saying that the President can virtually levitate. [Laughter]', 'Why? Why are they doing what they\'re doing? Why is the election in doubt? Why aren\'t we ahead in Texas in the polls? It is an affair of the heart. It is because we have practiced the politics of division for so long, we have tried to turn our opponents into aliens. We have been told, ""Oh, those Democrats, they don\'t really believe in work and being tough on crime and all that."" This is an affair of the heart.', ""And I tell you, this country does well when we find common ground, when we build bridges together, when we acknowledge it takes a village. And when we say we're on our own and our opponents are our enemies and they're no good and we need to be divided from one another, we always pay the price. Look at the history of the Alamo in the last 160 years. Does anyone doubt it is better now that we are joined together with our friends in Mexico and together with each other than it was 160 years ago?"", 'And so I ask you to get people to think differently and feel differently about this. Look at the budget choices. You bet I did veto their budget; it was bad for America. It would have divided us. And when they shut the Government down, I thought about the Alamo. They said, ""Oh, the President will cave; he won\'t be able to stand having the Government close."" We had this economy rocking along. We were number one in automobile production for the first time since the seventies. And they were threatening to default on our debt and wreck the economy. They said, ""Oh, he\'ll blink."" And I said, ""You know, I\'d a lot rather see the American people hurt for 2 or 3 weeks or 2 or 3 months than 20 or 30 years; shut her down. I\'m not going to buy your budget; I\'m not going to let you do it; it is wrong.""', 'But you have to understand. What they believe the old politics of division is, ""We\'ve got to have a tax cut, and so it\'s unfortunate but we\'ll just cut education and paralyze environmental protection and take away Medicaid\'s guarantee of health care to people with disabilities and poor children and wreck the Medicare program, because we\'ve got to have this other thing; it\'s either/or.""', ""I believe we can find common ground, we can balance the budget, have a targeted tax cut for people who really need it for education, for childrearing, for homebuying, for health care, and still protect education, the environment, Medicare, and Medicaid. That's common ground."", 'Now, the old politics of division used welfare as a whipping boy, you know, ""Everybody on welfare is lazy; nobody wants to work."" And then people on the other side said, ""Oh, no, no, they\'re good people; we\'ve got to take care of their children."" I said, ""Why do we have to choose between beating up on a system that doesn\'t work and protecting children? Why can\'t we do both?"" We have moved almost 2 million people from welfare to work. I signed a bill that protects health care and food and gives more for child care and then says we\'ve got to create jobs for people who are able-bodied to change the welfare check to a paycheck. And I\'ve got a plan to put another million jobs into the cities to create those jobs and then require people to take them. That\'s the new politics of common ground.', 'The old politics of division on law and order was all, you know, ""Talk tough. Don\'t do anything, but talk tough. Get tough on criminals."" And then the opponents would say, ""All they care about is being nice to people and trying to keep people out of trouble in the first place."" I said, ""Well, that\'s the dumbest thing I ever heard of. Why shouldn\'t we try to keep our kids out of the trouble in the first place and still do things that will be tough on serious criminals?""', ""So we passed the crime bill to put 100,000 police on the street, to take assault weapons off the street, to tell fugitives and felons and stalkers they couldn't buy handguns and protect the rights of people who were hunters and sportsmen to have them, and to give our children something to say yes to in prevention programs and to support safe and drug-free schools. Why was it punishment or prevention? Why was it division? Why, if you wanted to help kids stay out of trouble, were you soft on crime? We proved you could do both. You know what?"", 'We got 4 years of declining crime, the only Democratic ticket in history to be endorsed by every major law enforcement organization in the country because common ground is better than division and it works. It works.', 'The biggest problem I see with this, as we go into the future, is that nearly every family I know, even people with very good incomes, has faced some conflict between their responsibilities as parents and their responsibility at work. Everywhere I go in this country people talk to me about it. I believe we have to create an America where you can succeed at home and work.', ""This is a good example. When I was trying to pass the family leave law and Senator Dole and Congressman Gingrich were leading the fight against it, they said I was interfering in the economy; I would hurt the economy; I would burden the economy; we would undermine our recovery. We've got a higher rate of job growth than any Republican administration in 70 years, record numbers of new small businesses, and we've protected 12 million families. I think we ought to help people succeed at home and at work. That's the new politics of common ground."", 'I think we\'ve done the right thing to help families with this new requirement of more educational television and a television rating system. I think we\'ve done the right thing to try to fight against Republican cuts in the safe and drug-free schools program. We need more people out there telling kids that drugs are wrong, illegal, and can kill you, not fewer people. We don\'t need fewer people. And we did the right thing to be the first administration in history to stand up to the tobacco lobby and say, ""You can\'t advertise and sell cigarettes illegally to children anymore. You\'re killing them."" It was the right thing to do.', ""I believe we are doing the right thing whenever we work together. You know, they honestly believe on the other side that you can't grow the economy while protecting the environment. That's what they really believe. I'm not telling you they're bad people; they believe that. I know; I've talked to enough of them. They honestly believe it."", ""But look at the record. We've taken tons— millions of tons of chemicals out of the air in the last 4 years. We have improved our drinking water. We have raised standards for our food. We've cleaned up lots of toxic waste dumps."", ""We've protected more natural heritage. And the economy is growing faster because we can grow faster if we have sensible, proper environmental protection and public health. That's the right way to do that."", ""I want you to just look around today. I'm telling you, that's what this is all about. If I were a Republican President—after all the rhetoric they've used—with a declining deficit, a growing economy, a declining crime rate, declining welfare rolls, no Russian missiles pointed at our kids, by the way, and a stronger America with a stronger military, they'd be saying it's morning in America. But they love to practice the politics of division."", 'Look at the Alamo, folks. Think of Bosnia. Think of Northern Ireland. Think of the Middle East. Think of all those tribal wars now going on in Africa. Think of your own history. The great thing about this country is that in our best moments, we say, ""Our differences don\'t matter as much as our shared values. And everybody who believes in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence is part of our America. If you show up for work, if you show up for school, you do what you\'re supposed to do, we don\'t need to know anything else about you. You are part of our America."" That is what I believe.', 'So I want you to go out between now and Tuesday and say, ""Listen, this country is moving in the right direction. The President has good plans for the future, but most important, we have got to build a bridge to the future that is wide enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across, and we\'ve got to do it together. That is the question. We must be together. Build common ground, reject division, and build that bridge with us.""', 'Thank you, San Antonio. God bless you. And be there Tuesday.']"
133,William J. Clinton ,"November 02, 1996","[""The President. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, let me say it's good to be home, and thank you for coming out to say hello. I want to thank the Parkview High School Band, the Central High School Band, the Little Rock Community Choir. I want to thank all of those who are up here on the platform with me. I don't have everybody's name up here; I don't know if I can remember without eyes in the back of my head. I never needed eyes in the back of my head until I moved to Washington. [Laughter]"", ""I'm glad to be here today. I have just come from a great rally in front of the Alamo in San Antonio. And we were in El Paso, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, California on the day before that. I'm on my way back across the country, from here to New Orleans and then on to Florida. But I wanted to stop here just to be with you once before this election to say a special word of thanks to my good friend David Pryor for his lifetime of service to our State, to Congressman Ray Thornton for his lifetime of service and to wish him well on his new service on the Supreme Court. Thank you, Ray."", ""I thank my good friend Dale Bumpers. Folks, I don't know what I'd have done in the last 4 years if it hadn't been for Dale and David up there keeping me sane in the tough times, standing up for you and for what was right, and never being intimidated by some of the most overbearing and destructive tactics I have ever seen coming from the other side."", ""I want to thank Sharon Priest and Lottie Shackelford and Julia Peck Mobley and Gus Wingfield, Charlie Daniels, Mayor Dailey, Mayor Hays, Judge Villines. Thank you, Charlie Cole Chaffin, for running for lieutenant governor, and good luck to you. You were terrific. Bynum Gibson, my longtime friend Jimmy Lee Fisher, who was the coordinator of my campaign in the First Congressional District in 1978. We've been together a long time. Thank you, Jimmy Lee."", ""I read an article in the paper today, our morning paper here, saying that if the past was any precedent, it might be a mixed blessing for Winston Bryant and Vic Snyder and Marion Berry and Ann Henry for me to be coming down here today, because Arkansas people didn't really like for the President to tell them how to vote. Well, I couldn't tell you how to vote when I was Governor; I don't know how I'm going to start now. [Laughter] It never occurred to me to tell you how to vote. I will say this: Since he asked me for it, I'm going to give Vic Snyder my vote on Tuesday. I'll be here, and I'll be proud to vote for him. And I'll be proud to vote for Winston Bryant, and I wish I could vote for Marion and Ann."", 'Let me say to all of you, you ought to vote for yourselves, your children, and your future on Tuesday. But you need to understand that while all four of these people are friends of mine and I have worked with them and I know them very well, what you really should be voting on is what you want our country and this State to look like when we start that new century just 4 years from now.', ""We're about to have a Presidential election for the last President of the 20th century and the first President of the 21st century. And the stakes could hardly be greater. We're actually very fortunate because not only are the consequences large but the choice is so clear."", ""I really don't like a lot of what's happened in politics in the last several years. I don't like the fact that, especially when you get down toward the end and people get desperate, they think the only thing to do is to try to convince you that their opponent is no good. The truth is, since you all started me out 22 years ago, it has been my experience that most people who do the public's work are honest people, they work hard and they do what they think is right, virtually all the time—in both parties."", ""That's been my experience. And what I want to talk to you about today is that there are honest differences here. You know, I worked with Representative Hutchinson when he was in the State legislature; I liked him. We had a cordial relationship. Hillary and I send our prayers out to Tim and his wife for the welfare of their son. I know all of us feel that way, without regard to party. We ought to get away from this idea that we have to demonize our opponents in order to clarify our differences."", 'This is—and I appreciate what Winston said about that, you know. But don\'t worry about me. Every time I get down I remember—when they start picking at me I remember what Mark Twain said about a dog. Mark Twain said, ""Every dog ought to have a few fleas""—[Laughter]—""keeps him from worrying so much about being a dog."" [Laughter] Some days I feel I have more fleas than I wish I did, but don\'t worry about that.', ""Here's what the issue is, and you saw it in that budget fight we had when they shut the Government down and I vetoed the budget. This is about two different ways of looking at how we are as a people and how we're getting to the future. They believe that we're better off being on our own. And if we do good things together, that's fine. But it ought to basically be a question of letting everybody just go out there and do the best they can."", ""I believe that we do better when we help each other to have the tools to make the most of our own lives. Every politician I ever knew would try to give a speech every now and then trying to convince you that he or she was born in a log cabin that they built themselves. [Laughter] But the truth is there's not a one of us standing here today who'd be here if it weren't for the help of some other people. And I believe America is better when we work together to give everybody the tools to live up to the fullest of their God-given ability to keep our country a strong force for peace and freedom and prosperity and to give us a chance to live together in one community. That's what I believe. And that's the difference."", ""That's why the real issue is, should we say we're on our own, or should we build a bridge to the future we can all walk across together? That is the issue. That's the issue in all these Congress races. That's the issue in this Senate race. That is the issue."", ""I think they believed what they were doing when they passed that budget. I think they thought it was a good thing to give people like me a tax cut even though I didn't need it and cut Medicare and Medicaid. Let me just say, those words may not mean much to people. What they tried to do was to end the standards for nursing home care that David Pryor spent his entire life working for. They thought that was an inappropriate thing for us to be doing together, saying that there's some things that every senior citizen in every nursing home in every place in America ought to know that they can get if the Government is paying, through the taxpayers' money, to put them in a nursing home. I think David Pryor was right and they were wrong."", ""They wanted to take away the guarantee that we had given for 30 years to middle class families who have family members with disabilities so they can care for them, they can live at home, they can work, and they can have a decent life. They wanted to forget about that guarantee. They wanted to take away the guarantee of health care we've given for poor women and their little infant babies. And I think it was wrong. They wanted to cut the student loan program, cut Head Start, paralyze our ability to protect the environment, clean air, and clean water. That's what they wanted to do, and I think they were wrong."", ""But you have to decide whether they're right or not. I read all this stuff in the press about how Arkansas is, you know, more Republican or more Democrat, both parties are worried, and all that kind of stuff. Let me tell you, when I went up there 5 years ago and one month from tomorrow, when I announced for President here in Little Rock—I got a quote here of what I said—I said I wanted to go to Washington to do a better job of the old-fashioned work of confronting the real problems of real people and pointing the way to a better future: more opportunity, more responsibility, a stronger community."", 'Well, 4 years ago, the rest of the country took me on faith. You were the only people that knew exactly what you were doing. [Laughter] The rest of them took a chance. The rest of them took a chance.', ""But when you think about which approach works, when you think about Ann Henry, who's been our friend forever—she and her husband, Morris, hosted Hillary and I—our wedding reception in their home, and I've been wondering how many votes it was going to cost them in the election. [Laughter] But they did a great thing for us, and we'll never forget it. When I think about Marion Berry—I don't know how many times that Dale and David and I have been in Marion Berry's home for the coon supper at Gillette, but he's been with us all the time. He did a superb job at the Agriculture Department. When I think about Vic Snyder and all the votes that he cast in the Arkansas State Senate to give our children a better future and our State a stronger economy and make our environment stronger; when I think about Winston Bryant and the work that he did as secretary of state, as lieutenant governor, as attorney general—all the work we did together, all those years that we worked together, and I realize that they believe in the approach. And now you know whether it worked or not."", ""It's inconvenient for our friends in the Republican Party, but we do have 10.7 million more jobs than we did 4 years ago. It is inconvenient for them that this is a faster rate of job growth than under any Republican administration in 70 years. It's inconvenient. We have the lowest deficit of any great country in the world, the lowest it's been in America in 15 years; our average unemployment rate is the lowest it's been in 20 years; our average inflation rate is the lowest it's been in 30 years; we've had the biggest decline in income inequality among working people in 27 years; the lowest rates of unemployment and inflation together, the so-called misery index, in 27 years. This approach is working. That's why you ought to send him to Congress; it is the right thing for America. We need to keep going on this track."", 'We had 4 years of declining crime rates. The crime rate in America is at a 10-year low. There are 2 million fewer people, nearly, off welfare than there were 4 years ago. Child support collections in America are up 50 percent, $4 billion a year. This approach is working.', ""Now, it's interesting to me that right before this Congress had to go home and face the voters, they all of a sudden decided they like my agenda. So now they're home running on the fact that even though they opposed it, finally we did raise the minimum wage for 10 million people; we passed a health care reform bill that says you can't have your health care taken away from you just because you changed jobs or somebody in your family has been sick; said the insurance companies can't kick mothers and their newborn babies out of the hospital after a day."", 'Those were good things. It is a good thing. But that\'s what we should have been doing all along. And I\'m telling you, this is not—and let me just say this: One thing it isn\'t, this race, it is not about conservative or liberal. The crime bill we passed had 100,000 police. It had the death penalty for drug kingpins and people that killed police officers. It has ""three strikes and you\'re out."" It also had, as you know, the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban. And they made a lot of hay out of that in Arkansas.', 'Do you remember 2 years ago? Now, you know they were going around Arkansas saying, ""Oh, that Clinton\'s gone crazy. He went to Washington; now he\'s going to take your gun away."" Well, it\'s been 2 years, and now we know there\'s not a single hunter in Arkansas that\'s lost a weapon, but 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers didn\'t get handguns because of the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban—don\'t need to be on the street in Little Rock. They don\'t need to be here.', 'Now we know. So vote for yourselves, but this approach will work. There\'s still a lot of things we have to do. Your vote—don\'t be deluded here—there are huge consequences to your vote. What would America look like—Dale Bumpers is right—what would America look like if their budget had prevailed? If their budget had prevailed it would have been a clear message: ""You\'re on your own; we\'re going to be more divided. Those of us that are well-positioned, we\'re going to do better. And those who aren\'t, well, they\'ll do worse and it\'s just tough.""', 'Now, that\'s what would have happened. And when they shut the Government down, they thought that Dale and David and Ray and I, they thought we\'d wilt. They thought that the Democrats would just be miserable not having the Government open every day. They were even willing to bring us to the point of default, the people in that Congress were, to wreck all the economic progress we\'d made because they thought we\'d wilt. And you know what I told them? ""I\'d a lot rather see the American people hurt for 20 or 30 days than for 20 or 30 years. You have at it; I\'m not going to buy that budget. You can forget about it.""', 'Now, you have to decide. But how you vote in these races will determine whether we do what I want to do, which is to balance the budget and still protect Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment, or adopt their scheme of an even bigger tax cut which would still raise taxes on 9 million of the hardest pressed working people in America and blow a hole in the deficit and require bigger cuts than the ones I vetoed. You have to decide.', ""You have to decide whether we are going to continue to put 100,000 police on the street. This is an amazing thing—you ask the mayors that are here; this is amazing. First they tried not to put 100,000 police on the street. Then they tried to do away with it in their budget. Then they tried to cut it back a third time. And I stopped them every time. I'd like to have somebody up there in Washington who believes in law enforcement and would like to make our streets safer. If we have 4 more years of declining crime, we might have every neighborhood, every street, every school, and every child in this country safe again. And that's what I want. And that's what they want. And I hope you'll give us a chance to do it."", ""There's a lot more to do in health care. Our balanced budget plan has some things in health care reform that they'll never be able to do. But I turned it in, in a balanced budget plan: let families keep their health insurance for 6 months when they're between jobs, put another million children into the ranks of health-insured, free mammograms for women on Medicare, and a little help for respite care for the 1.7 million families who are courageously helping to care for family members with Alzheimer's disease. These are important things. They won't do it, and we will. If you want that done, you better vote for them. That's what's at stake here."", ""But let me say this: Of all the issues—and you know them well—the biggest issue before us involves these children here, and that's the question of education. What is their plan for education? Abolish the Department of Education. Do you really want that?"", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. Do you believe America can afford to be the only great country in the world to start the 21st century with no one even sitting at the President's Cabinet to speak for the children of America?"", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. That's their position. My position is hook every classroom in every rural school in Arkansas and every inner-city school up to that information superhighway and give those kids access to world-class education, open the doors of college education to all Americans."", 'You want to talk about a tax cut—the most important tax cut we could give is to let people deduct the cost of a typical community college tuition from their tax bill. That would open 2 more years of education to every American. Let people deduct $10,000 a year for college tuition at any college in America then every young person and every grownup who needs to go back to college could afford to go.', ""That is the choice. And you just have to decide. And I'm telling you, when you go in there on Tuesday, when you talk to your friends and neighbors and you go back home—there are people here from all over this State, from all of our congressional districts—you tell them that it's exactly what is on the line here. Are we going to do this together, or are we going to be driven apart?"", ""You know, so much—when I left here I couldn't have known exactly what challenges would confront me as President, in terms of foreign policy especially. I'm grateful that the United States has been a force for peace. I'm grateful that we've been able to open new markets for American products and we're selling more American products than ever before. We're number one in auto production now for the first time since the 1970's. I'm glad we've been able to do these things."", ""But it's amazing how much time I have to spend with people around the world doing things that we try to teach our children not to do. People all over the world—you look at the Middle East or Bosnia or Haiti or Northern Ireland or all those tribal wars in Africa and all this. What is this about? People hating each other because they're of different religions, different races, different ethnic groups, and different tribes. Everything you try to teach your kids not to do—you know, treat everybody with respect and define yourself in terms of what you believe, not who you can look down on. There are people all over the world now who are literally consumed with hatred for other people because they're in different groups."", ""And if we get divided, that will happen more. That's why I spoke out so strongly against hating people who worked for the Federal Government after the tragedy in Oklahoma City. That's why when all these church burnings occurred, we got on it and we tried to stop it and we tried to get after it. And that's why I want you to think about that, too. How long were we held back in this State because black people and white people couldn't get along? How long?"", 'Audience members. Too long!', 'The President. How long will we be held back in the 21st century if we say, ""We\'re not going to work together. I want mine; you get yours. There\'s the future; I hope you make it."" Hillary was right, it does take a village to raise our kids and to build our future.', ""The world is changing in ways you can't imagine. Arkansas will change in ways you can't imagine. No one can fully perceive the implications. When I became President, 3 million people were making a living in their homes. Today, because of computers, 12 million people are making a living in their homes. Four years from now, 30 million people will be making a living in their homes."", ""In the last 4 years, we've found two genes that cause breast cancer, and if we're lucky, we may be able to find enough genetic information not only to cure breast cancer but to prevent it. We're using a lot of these satellite, sophisticated imaging technologies now to beam into bodies to see if we can find out what's wrong with people before any of their problems get out of hand. We just found out that we could make a laboratory animal with its spine severed have movement in its lower limbs by transferring the nerves from the legs to the spine. None of this has ever been done before. We're building a supercomputer, the Government is, with IBM that will do more calculations in one second than you can do on a handheld calculator in 30,000 years."", ""I'm telling you, the world is changing. And for us to go back to the old politics that the other side is preaching, trying to convince people that their opponents don't share American values, that they're aliens from outer space, that everything the Government ever did was wrong, is nuts."", ""We have to stand up for a bright future. The best days of this country are still ahead. But we'll only achieve them—we will only achieve those days if we define carefully what we should do together. But I'll say again, it's not about liberal and conservative. I want you to tell your friends and neighbors this when you go home: We have reduced the size of the Government to its smallest size since Kennedy was President, more than the last two Republican administrations did. We eliminated more Government regulations and more Government programs than the two Republican administrations did. We privatized more Government operations than the two Republican administrations did. This is not about liberal or conservative. We have run by far the most fiscally conservative Government, and we've done more to stand against crime. And we've stuck up for this country in having a strong foreign policy."", ""I think the record will stand on its own. This is not what that's about. This is about whether you're going to be diverted and divided, or whether we're going to find common ground and build that bridge to the 21st century together. You've got enough sense to figure out how to talk to your friends and neighbors about that between now and Tuesday. Don't let the people of Arkansas be diverted from the real issue. This country is better off and this State's better off than it was 4 years ago. It's going to be better off 4 years from now if we stay on the right track to build that bridge to the 21st century."", 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"
134,William J. Clinton ,"November 02, 1996","[""The President. Can you hear me in the back? [Applause] Wave your hands. Look back there. What a great crowd we have tonight. Thank you, New Orleans, for coming out. Thank you for your support. Thank you for the little song down here. Let's thank these fine young men who sang the national anthem again. They were great, the students who are here."", 'Reverend Morton, Mr. Mayor, thank you for making me feel so welcome here. Thank you for your exceptional leadership. Thank you for taking up for the children of New Orleans and trying to make them safer when the Sun goes down. I appreciate that.', ""My good friend Congressman Jefferson, thank you for being there with me in the dark days as well as the bright ones. Representative Cleo Fields, thank you for your service in the Congress, your support for me and Mary Landrieu and all of our other candidates. And thank you especially for going all over America to mobilize young people to vote to reelect Bill Clinton and Al Gore. Thank you, sir. My great friend John Breaux, to whom I owe so much—if you support John Breaux, as I think you do, you will elect Mary Landrieu just to keep a smile on John's face. I don't believe I could bear the thought of seeing what it's going to be like for John. [Laughter]"", 'Ladies and gentlemen, I have come here tonight with a heart full of gratitude to all of you for giving me the chance to serve as President, for giving me the chance to do what has been done in the last 4 years, and to ask you to keep America on the right track to the 21st century and to help me build that bridge that we can all walk across together. Will you do that? [Applause]', 'It is hard to believe, on the banks of this great river that has seen so much history, that the United States is about to elect the last President of the 20th century and the first President of the 21st century. But we are. We are about to do something even more important, for in this election and the race for the Senate and other races all across America we are going to decide just how we\'re going into that 21st century: whether there will be a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past; whether there will be a bridge that we all walk across together, where we try to help each other make the most of our own lives, or whether we\'ll say, ""You\'re on your own""; whether we will rise up as one people seeking common ground, or whether we will give in to the old politics of division that has bedeviled people of Louisiana and Arkansas and our whole region for too long in the past.', ""Now, that is what is really at issue here. We know what works. Four years ago, everyone except the people in my own home State and the Louisianians that lived near the border took me on faith. I said we would create more opportunity and insist on more responsibility, that we'd pull closer together in an American community, and everybody would have a place and a role to play. But you took me on faith. Now we know what works."", ""We have 10.7 million more jobs than we had 4 years ago. The deficit has gone down by 63 percent all 4 years for the first time in the 20th century. Our exports out of the Port of New Orleans and elsewhere are at an all-time high. More than half the new jobs are in highwage categories. Wages are going up again for the first time in a very long time. We've had a 27-year—a 27-year—best combined rates of unemployment and inflation. You have to go all the way back to 1968—that's 28 years, isn't it? You weren't even born. That's the best it's been since you've been alive. We had the biggest drop in inequality among working people, more people sharing in the bounty of America in 28 years, the biggest drop in childhood poverty in 20 years, the lowest rate in poverty among our senior citizens ever recorded. We are moving in the right direction. We don't need a change; we need to bear down."", ""We have more children in Head Start. We've got a better college loan program that costs students less and gives them more opportunities to repay it as a percentage of their income, a 20-year high in Pell grant scholarships, the AmeriCorps program giving young people a chance to serve and earn money for college. We've got a 10-year low in the crime rate. We have 2 million fewer people on welfare and a 50 percent increase in child support payments. We are moving in the right direction right across the board. We need to bear down and do more."", 'Now, in the face of this my opponent would have you believe that the world is coming to an end. It was announced yesterday that we had—or the day before—we had 210,000 new jobs last month alone. And his response was, ""This is the worst economy in 20 years."" Now, wait a minute, it\'s not all bad. Just 2 weeks ago, he said we had the worst economy in 100 years. That\'s the best argument I\'ve heard for my reelection. Who else do you know could make up 80 years in 2 weeks? We\'re moving in the right direction toward the 21st century. But we are moving in the right direction because we\'re doing a lot of things together— together.', ""I appreciate so many things that have been said tonight, but I come here to tell you that I am not solely responsible for the good economic news or the declining crime rates or the declining welfare rolls, but we have played a role. And that is the issue. So many of our friends on the other side, and especially people way on over there like Mary Landrieu's opponent, they don't believe there is much of anything we should do together. But I believe there are."", ""And the great thing about this election for you is that the choice is so clear and the consequences are so great. So you have to decide in the President's race and in the Senate race, do you want to balance the budget and have a targeted tax cut for education and childrearing and protect Medicare and Medicaid for folks with disabilities and poor children, our seniors in nursing homes? And do you want to protect our ability to have clean air and clean water and clean ground and a safe future? [Applause] And do you want to protect our investments in education and technology and our future? [Applause]"", ""Well, then you just have one choice, because if you go the other way, you'll get a very different future: blowing a hole in the deficit, increasing interest rates, weakening the economy, bigger cuts than those that I vetoed."", ""Audience member. That's why we've got you! [Laughter]"", ""The President. You're good. Keep going. [Laughter]"", 'I think one of the most important things we have been able to do is to help more people, millions of people, fulfill their obligations to their children and to their workplace. When we passed the family and medical leave law, my opponent said it would hurt the economy. He said it was terrible. He tried to kill it. But we passed it.', ""Well, now we know; 3 1/2 years later, 12 million families have taken a little time off for the birth of a baby or the illness of a family member, and they didn't lose their jobs. And what have we had: 10.7 million new jobs and record numbers of new small businesses. We were right. Their approach was wrong. We should help each other make the most of our own lives. We should help people succeed at home and at work. We ought to let people take some time off to go see the teachers of their children twice a year and take their kids to the doctor as well. When people earn overtime, if somebody in the family is sick, they ought to be able to decide whether to take the overtime in money or take it in time at home taking care of their families. We have to help people succeed at home and at work."", ""We ought to continue to support the safe and drug-free schools program so people will be in our schools telling our children early, before it's too late, that drugs are wrong, illegal, they can kill you. I support that. They tried to cut it in half, and they'll try again unless you have somebody like Mary Landrieu who believes our kids are entitled to be kept out of trouble in the first place and saved for a better, brighter future."", 'We are in the middle of a great national effort to try to stop the big tobacco companies from marketing and distributing tobacco illegally to our children. Three thousand kids start smoking every day illegally, and 1,000 will die sooner because of it. We are trying to stop it. That is not done yet. My opponent opposes that. The election will determine whether we see that through. We are supporting people like your mayor all over the country and working to support projects like the curfews and school uniform projects and anything else that will help keep our kids in a safer way.', ""We're trying to put 100,000 police on the street. We've only funded half of them. Our opponent opposed that. Then they abolished it in the budget that I vetoed. Then they tried to cut it again. Now, the crime rate is coming down every year in part because we have more people walking the streets in uniforms working with their neighbors, working with the kids, preventing crime from happening. Why in the wide world anybody would want to stop it is beyond me. I guess that's why every major law enforcement organization in America for the first time supported Bill Clinton and Al Gore for reelection. If you want to keep that going, support people like Mary Landrieu who believe we should have community policing and safer streets and futures for all of our children."", ""We want a future in which we grow the economy and clean the environment. We've taken millions of tons of chemicals out of our air, set aside unprecedented lands for national preservation, raised the standards of food safety, raised the standards for drinking water purity, and cleaned up more toxic waste dumps in 3 years than they did in 12. But there's still 10 million kids in this country living within 4 miles of a toxic waste site, and if you'll help us, we'll clean up 500 more in the next 4 years so that we'll be living next to parks, not poison."", ""But your vote will decide, for they had a very different view. They wanted to change the law and say the polluters don't have to pay anymore for what they do; the taxpayers should pick up the whole tab—never mind that all the money wasn't there, we might never get around to cleaning up a lot of these dumps. You have to decide."", 'And there is no decision more important than the one you\'ll make with regard to the education of our children and our adults in the future. I\'m glad there are so many young people here, because this election is about you. Now, what is their program? Well, when they had a chance, they cut Head Start and they cut student loans and they voted to eliminate the Department of Education. And when I vetoed their budget, they said they believed in it so much they shut the Government down. And they said, ""Oh, John Breaux and Cleo Fields and Bill Jefferson and President Clinton, they just love the Government; they\'d never let it get shut down""—all their rhetoric, you know. And you know what I told them? ""I hate to see you shut this Government down; I hate to see you hurt the Federal employees; I hate to see you interrupt essential services. But I would far prefer to see the American people hurt for 20 or 30 days than to see them hurt for 20 or 30 years. I\'m not going to sign this budget; it will not be the law of the land, because I don\'t believe families who happen to have family members who are living in wheelchairs should be denied Medicaid and the right to have a middle class lifestyle and because I don\'t believe we should cut college scholarships and loans.""', ""What's our program for the future? What's our program for the future? I want to ask you to help me do this. Now, you think about the future. We are living in a time where the winds of change are not just blowing on the Mississippi, they're blowing everywhere in the world. We're having dramatic changes in the way we work and live and relate to the rest of the world. That's how New Orleans can increase exports 30 percent in one year. The world's not growing 30 percent economically in a year. New Orleans—the people who work here are taking the work of Americans and finding new opportunities exploding all over the world. When I became President, 3 million people were making a living by working at home every day. Today, 12 million are. By the year 2000, 30 million will be."", ""In the last 4 years, we've discovered two genes that lead to breast cancer. We may be able not only to cure but to prevent breast cancer because of the research that we're doing there. In the past few months, for the first time, laboratory animals with their spines severed have had movement in their lower legs by nerve transplants to their spine from other parts of their bodies. We may be able to see people get up and walk that thought they'd never be able to do it again. We are literally bursting the frontiers of knowledge."", 'Their education program is to abolish the Department of Education——', 'Audience members. Boo-o-o!', 'The President. ——and cut funding to our public schools. My education program: 200,000 more work-study places for young people in college; get a million volunteers, including 100,000 college students on work-study, to teach every young person in this country to read a book by the time that he or she is 8 years old; hook up every classroom in a Louisiana school, no matter how poor the district is, to the information superhighway so all our kids can get access to world-class learning for the first time in history; and open the doors of college education to all Americans. Will you help us do that? Will you help Mary Landrieu have a vote in the Senate to do that? [Applause]', 'Think of it, folks, in just 4 years, we can make 2 years of education after high school as universal as a high school diploma is today simply by saying you can deduct, dollar for dollar, on your taxes the cost of a typical community college tuition; all you have to do is show up and make your grades and do your work. I want to give a $10,000 tax deduction per year for the cost of any college tuition after high school for people of any age. Will you help us do that? [Applause]', ""Now, again I say, you want to know what the differences are between the efforts I'm making and the efforts that Senator Dole is earnestly and honestly pursuing? I don't like all these personal attacks. I think it's just kind of a political deal. We just honestly disagree. The difference in my position and his, the difference in Mary Landrieu's and her opponent is that if you look at the family leave law; if you look at the 100,000 police on the street; if you look at the Brady bill, which kept 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers and now will keep people who beat up their spouses and their kids from getting handguns; if you look at our new college loan program; if you look at the targeted tax cuts for college, we believe that we're a better, stronger country when we work together to help each other have not a guarantee but the tools to make the most of their own lives. They believe you're better off on your own. You have to decide. Will you stand with us? Will you fight with us? Will you build that bridge to the 21st century with us? [Applause] We need you, Louisiana."", 'Thank you, and God bless you.']"

And we did have a good time. My grandfather used to joke with me that if we didn't have any better sense than to know we were poor, we could have a good time. [Laughter] And we're having a good time today."", ""I'm honored to be in this historic pulpit which has been graced by Martin Luther King, Thurgood Marshall, Adam Clayton Powell, Jackie Robinson. I am humbled to be here.

Thank you."", 'In just 2 days all of us together will go to the polls to select the last President of this unbelievable 20th century, the century of the civil rights movement, the century of two great World Wars and the Great Depression, the century of the cold war, a century of more bloodshed than any in history, but a century of remarkable progress as more and more people move toward the realization that all of us are created equal in the eyes of God, are entitled to live as equals in the eyes of God—the masters of our fate, save only in subjugation to our God.', 'And with a vast new century stretching before us, we know that the world is changing in ways we cannot fully understand. Just think about all the changes you have seen here in your community in the last 4 or 5 years. Think about the changes technology is bringing in the way we work and live and relate to one another and the rest of the world. Think about how much more involved in the rest of the world we are today than ever before.', 'We have a decision to make that goes way beyond the vote on Tuesday. And frankly, it goes way beyond Democrats and Republicans, way beyond even the choice for President. It goes far out into the future and deep into the human heart. We have to decide as a people how we\'re going to keep walking into that 21st century and whether we will say to each other, ""You\'re on your own,"" or we\'re going to build a bridge together so that everyone has the tools to make the most of his or her own life. And we have to decide whether we\'re going to build that bridge on the shifting sands of division or on the strong rock of common ground. I believe I know what your decision would be.', ""I was so glad to hear that wonderful passage from John about the Pool of Bethesda. When I went to the Holy Land for the first time about 15 years ago, I was looking for the Pool of Bethesda because it's a great remembrance that when the angel whirled the waters and made it possible for people to go there and find healing power, Jesus thought the healing power ought to be given even to the one who could not even get to the pool. No one was left out. Even the one who could not even get to the pool was given the healing power of the Spirit. That is a lesson for us."", ""When people tell me, well, some people just aren't going to make it, I say that's true, but it ought to be their fault, not ours. It ought to be their fault, not ours. We can't give anybody a guarantee in life. Even the man crawling to the pool had to believe. His body wouldn't move, but his mind would. So I don't seek to give anybody a guarantee, but I think everybody ought to have a chance."", ""You know, after the events of the last week, when we are divided we defeat ourselves. How heartbreaking it is on this Lord's day that there is still no peace in the Holy Land. A year ago tomorrow, the Prime Minister of Israel was murdered by one of his own people because he sought to bring peace to the Holy Land. The place where the three great religions of the world that believe we are all created by one God, all of us and all of our differences are created by one God, claim as holy, they're still fighting over religion."", ""In Bosnia, a place where the ethnic groups are divided into three by accident of political and military history, not because they are biologically distinguishable, they're still fighting over their differences. Science has not gotten in the way of believing that they are inherently different. That's what they believe."", 'In Africa today, the Hutus and the Tutsis share poor lands—with poor children who desperately need the product of earnest, sustained, loving, cooperative labor—somehow find it more profitable to slaughter each other and make the land poorer.', ""Well, that's why when our Federal Government employees are singled out for hatred, when a horrible tragedy like Oklahoma City occurs, when a black or a white church is burned or a synagogue or a mosque is defaced in America, we must stand against that, because we know that we are all in this together, that we are going to rise or fall together, that we have a duty to help each other in our work, in our family, in our lives as citizens, a duty to live in a way that enables us to find common ground and a responsibility to give everyone else the opportunity to go over that bridge with us into tomorrow."", 'Now, President Lincoln once paraphrased Jesus\' sermon in St. Matthew when he said, ""The house divided against itself cannot stand."" I didn\'t have time to go back and read it today, but I believe that the whole verse says ""A city and a house divided against itself cannot stand""—not Tampa, not St. Petersburg, not Washington, DC, not the United States of America. Four years ago, when I asked for this job, I was worried because our people were divided and dispirited and as a result we were not doing together what we should have been doing to lift our economy or deal with the whole array of problems plaguing our society, involving so many of our children, of their futures.', 'Now, I know I am preaching to a choir today—[laughter]—but in the next 2 days we need the choir to preach. [Laughter] We will never be what we ought to be if we allow our country to be led by those who believe we are better off on our own and who seek to pursue that path by driving wedges between us and exploiting our fears and convincing us that our brothers and sisters of different races, different faiths, different walks of life are our inherent enemies. That is the prescription for disaster in the Holy Land, in Bosnia, in Africa, and in the United States. And we have only become greater at each stage along the way because every time we had to face the music we chose common ground over the shifting sands of division. And that is what we must do again in this season of our decision.', 'We have seen the results of the politics of division and gridlock, but now we have seen the results of the politics of opportunity and responsibility and the common ground we seek to build in our American community. We have more jobs, a lower deficit, higher growth, the highest rate of homeownership in 15 years, the highest rates of homeownership and small business ownership among African-Americans, other minorities, and women in the history of America. It turns out giving everybody a chance— not a guarantee but a chance—is good for the rest of us.', ""While all these big numbers were occurring, we've seen the biggest decline in inequality among working people in 27 years, the biggest drop in child poverty in 20 years, the lowest rates of poverty ever recorded for senior citizens and African-Americans since the statistics have been kept. It is the right thing to do for all the rest of us to see that everybody has a chance, just as the man struggling for the pool at Bethesda was given his chance."", 'We are seeing the benefits of greater responsibility: The welfare rolls are down; the crime rate is at a 10-year low. We see in so many other areas—4 years of declining teenage pregnancy, the first drop in out-of-wedlock pregnancy in 20 years, community efforts building up all over the country, more and more people going in our schools to tell our children that drugs are wrong and illegal and can kill you, more and more citizen efforts working with the police to try to help keep the streets safer, more and more communities doing things to try to help our young people stay out of trouble like curfew policies or even school uniform policies and other things. These experiments going on in America, people working together to try to find ways to be responsible citizens—in every place it is done, we are better off.', ""We're seeing a deeper sense of community, trying to preserve our natural environment for our children and our grandchildren. I thank Governor Chiles for the work he has done on the Everglades. Every person in Florida, in the farthest northern corner of Florida has a stake in that. Every person in the farthest northwest corner of America has a stake in saving our common heritage."", 'We see it in so many other ways. We have been moved by the enormous upswelling of American conviction in the aftermath of Oklahoma City, the reaction to the church burnings being so negative. Our common sense, whenever it prevails to bring us together as a community, makes us stronger.', ""And I really believe we're on the verge of the most exciting period in human history. But we can't forget what brought us here, because it will take us home. So the trick for us is to find out with God's wisdom how to seize all these fabulous opportunities that are out there in a way that enables us to move closer to our values."", 'It is really true that none of us live by bread alone. I don\'t know any serious person who\'s lived long enough who believes that with all the bread in the world you can be really happy. [Laughter] On the other hand, it\'s important not to be too self-righteous. I always say one of my rules of politics is whenever you hear a person standing on a corner screaming, ""This is not a money problem,"" sure as the world he\'s talking about somebody else\'s problem, not his. [Laughter]', 'So we need to be a little humble about this. But we have work to do. If you think about what our children can do, if we could put every child in America, from the poorest inner cities to the most remote rural areas, in a classroom with a computer that was hooked up to the entire information superhighway, then for the first time ever every child in America would have access to the same learning in the same way at the same time. That would revolutionize what our children could do, all of our children.', ""If we could put a million citizens with 100,000 more police and walk the blocks together, we could have not 4 years but 8 years of declining crime and all of our children could feel safe on their streets and in their schools and in their neighborhoods. We can reclaim our streets. Four years ago millions of people did not believe we could ever do anything about rising crime. Now we have no excuse. We know we can bring it down for 4 years, but we know we have to have about 4 more years before it will be tolerable to live in still a lot of our places. But we can make our streets safe again, we know that. But we'll have to do that together. And we can do that in the future."", ""We know that we're breaking down the frontiers of ignorance in so many ways that will help us to cure cancer, that will help us to find ways to grow our economy while we improve our environment, that will help us to find ways to create jobs for people who have never been able to get them before. But we have work to do. I signed a law that says that everybody on welfare who's able-bodied will keep getting health care and food and child care if they go to work, but if they're able-bodied, they've got to trade the welfare check for a paycheck in 2 years. That's the law. But now we have figured out something we haven't really been able to figure out for a long time, which is how to give jobs to people. You can't tell people they have to go to work unless there's work for them to find. So we've got work to do."", ""We know we've got work to do in building our American family. We know there's still too many kids who don't think drugs will kill them. We know that 3,000 children start smoking every day and a thousand will die sooner as a result, even though it's illegal. We know that even though we have removed a lot of assault weapons from our streets and made it harder for criminals to get guns, there's still too many completely innocent children being killed. We know that even though we have demonstrated in our administration that you can have diversity and excellence—in my appointments to the Cabinet, to the Federal bench, and throughout the country—there are still too many people who are literally afraid to deal as equals with people who are different from them. We know that."", ""We know that there are still too many white people who wouldn't feel as comfortable as I do sitting in this church today. And that's wrong. They read the same Bible you do. They claim the same Saviour you do. They ought to feel at home here. We've got work to do. And you ought to feel at home in their churches."", ""So I say to you, we have work to do. Our best days are still ahead. But we must always marry our progress to the realization of our values. We have to take advantage of progress to move closer to living as we say we believe. We have work to do. And as we get closer and closer and closer to the election, the work passes from my hands to yours again. It's a very humbling thing for me, you know. If you ever doubt whether the people are the boss in the end in a democracy, run for office. [Laughter] Run for office. Even the President is a hired hand— [laughter]—trying to get a contract renewed. [Laughter] It's a humbling thing. There is a power in freedom that you cannot underestimate. We take it for granted."", ""You know, now, in the last few years, for the first time in all of human history, more people are living in democracies on the face of the Earth than dictatorships. It's the first time in all of human history, just in the last few years. Think how far your ancestors walked, think how many bled and died to give you the right to vote. And think what a blessing it is that you are anchored in what you believe and that you are not subject to the wild winds that often blow through the airwaves at election time."", 'I ask you to let me share this story as I close. In 1992, when I was seeking this office, I was in a church much like this in Cleveland one night. It was a warm night, and the church was without air conditioner—at least the air conditioner was unequal to the hot air all the public officials were spewing out. [Laughter] And we were packed in that church. And it was one of those meetings, you know, where everybody there talked but three people, and they went home mad. [Laughter]', 'Everybody talked. We all got to talk. And the temperature rose, and people started wanting to get out. And the great pastor in that church stood up, who is a friend of mine, Reverend Otis Moss, one of America\'s great preachers; some of you may know him. And he started talking to the people about the simple act of voting. And he said, ""You know, my father could not vote; the law did not allow him to vote. And finally, one day the law was changed, and he could vote. And he walked 7 miles to the polling place. But the people did not want my father to vote, and they said, ‘Mr. Moss, you\'re at the wrong place.\' So they sent him to another place, and he walked a couple of more miles. And they said, ‘Mr. Moss, you\'re still at the wrong place.\' And they sent him to another place, and he had to walk a couple of more miles. And when they got there, they said, ‘Mr. Moss, the polls have closed.""\'', 'And he said, ""When my daughter was old enough to vote, I took her to the polling place, and we went together to two voting machines side-by-side. And I know you\'re not supposed to linger in the ballot booth. But I couldn\'t vote. I put my ear right next to that booth until I heard my daughter vote. We don\'t miss votes at our house,"" he said.', ""This is a day that the Lord hath made; let us rejoice and be glad in it. And let us remember that here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own. We have work to do. But if we do it and if we remember, like Jesus, even the man who could not reach the pool at Bethesda, we will all go forward on that bridge to the 21st century together."", 'Thank you, and God bless you.']"

And I thank them.', ""I thank Buddy MacKay for being there for me from the beginning 5 years ago, Attorney General Bob Butterworth, Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson, Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford, my friends, good public servants. And thank you, Bob, for your insistence on our doing something about the tomato problem. I'm glad we were able to do it, and you deserve a lot of the credit for it. Thank you very much."", 'I thank the congressional candidates who are here today, Jim Stuber, Ken Cooper, and Robert Wexler. And I thank Congressman Peter Deutsch for the fine job he has done in the United States Congress.', 'Bob Graham talked about the budget that our friends on the other side passed. And they said that if I didn\'t cave in to it, that they would just close the Government. And then they said, ""You Democrats, you love the Government, you\'ll never let us close it down, and we\'ll put this budget right on you."" And I said, ""It\'s not me you\'re putting it on. I\'m going to be all right. Most of my life is lived. It\'s the American people you\'re putting it on, and I\'d rather have the American people inconvenienced by 30 days of Government shutdown than hurt for 30 years by that budget."" And they stood by me, and I thank them, or we wouldn\'t have been able to do it.', ""I want to thank my good friend Jimmy Buffett for singing for me today. Wasn't he great? [Applause] Four years ago Jimmy Buffett came to Tampa and sang for us. I'm glad he's here today. I want to thank the Sun Coast High School Chargers Sonic Sound, the Santa Luces High School Marching Chiefs. Thank you for being here."", ""And Madam Mayor, let me thank you. I have said all over this country that we are in a period of profound change in how we work and live and relate to each other and the rest of the world. Some of the issues that have been discussed today already illustrate that. I have tried to say to all my fellow Americans that, even more than normal, this is not a race of party. It is a race of country; it is a race about people. And Mayor, I'm honored to have the support of all the Republicans for Clinton and Gore around the country, and especially your support. Thank you very, very much. Thank you. I might say, if you pick up your Newsweek tomorrow, you will see that your mayor was named one of the 25 mayors to watch in the United States. And I'm going to be watching her; I think you will, too. Congratulations."", ""On this beautiful Sunday we should be grateful to be Americans and grateful for the privilege we're about to have. I can tell you this: As we get closer and closer to the election, it becomes more and more obvious that in this great democracy you count more than all of us in elected office. And those of us like me are simply coming to you, the boss, to get our contact renewed. It is now up to you to make these judgments."", ""Four years ago, amid a time of high unemployment and rising frustration, rising crime and welfare rolls and increasing division, I came to you and asked you to give Al Gore and Bill Clinton the chance to change the course of America, to go beyond the tired old political debates that had dominated Washington for too long, to go beyond insults to issues, beyond the politics of who's to blame to a politics of what are we going to do together to make our country a better place. I asked you to help me create more opportunity, demand more responsibility, and create an American community in which all of you have a place at the table and a role to play. I said then and I say again today that I believe the central role of our National Government is to give you the tools to make the most of your own lives and to create the conditions of security and freedom and opportunity that will make us all a better, stronger people. And I said that I thought that we ought to have a smaller Government, but it still ought to be strong enough to give you those tools and help you when you need it."", ""We have worked hard for 4 years now, and you don't have to take us on faith anymore; there is a record, a record that is good and strong. And that is the fundamental fact. We enter this election day with 10 1/2 —10.7 million more jobs; the lowest combined rates of unemployment and inflation in 27 years; the highest rates of homeownership in 15 years; with America number one in exporting and number one in automobile production for the first time since 1979—your country is number one again; with record numbers of new small businesses in every single year of the last 4 years; with declining poverty rates among seniors and African-Americans; with declining inequality among all people who are working, the biggest drop in income inequality among working people in 27 years; nearly 2 million fewer people on the welfare rolls; a 50 percent increase in child support enforcement; 4 years of declining crime rates, crime at a 10-year low. Folks, we are better off than we were 4 years ago, and we are moving in the right direction."", ""Now, I can't help noting on this Sunday that on the day that it was announced we had 210,000 more jobs, my opponent said that our economy was in the worst shape in 20 years. Now, that's not all bad because just 2 weeks earlier, our opponent said we were in the worst shape we'd been in in 100 years. [Laughter] So he's making the case for my reelection. I mean, who else do you know who could move us 80 years in 2 weeks? We're doing all right."", ""But let's face it. There is more to be done. We still have work to do to build that bridge to the 21st century. We still have work to do to make sure every American, without regard to race or religion or where they start in life, has a chance to live out his or her dreams. We still have work to do to make sure all of our citizens are acting responsibly. And we still have work to do to bring this country together as one community. I have tried to run this campaign in a way that would do that, to make this a campaign of issues and not insults. I thank Governor Chiles for what he said."", ""One of the more interesting aspects of the opposition's effort has been their obsession with my wife. [Laughter] Well, I'm obsessed with her too, but in a different way. And they think we're better off on our own. I think she was right when she said it takes a village to raise our children and build our future. And I want to say that Governor Chiles' announcement made two people in this audience especially happy: Hillary's mother and sister-in-law, my mother-in-law and sister-in-law who are here, Dorothy Rodham and Maria Arias Rodham. Thank you very much."", ""We have work to do. Your vote will decide what we're going to do on that great budget issue next time. Let's look at the record. The record is, this is not about liberal and conservative. Ask Senator Graham or Congressman Deutsch. Our administration has reduced the size of Government to its smallest size in 30 years, more than the previous two Republican administrations. We have eliminated more Government regulations than they did, eliminated more unnecessary programs than they did, privatized more Government operations than they did."", 'What we were not willing to do was to have a budget that in the name of balancing the budget actually shifted resources to a few who did not need it, away from those who did need it to protect the integrity of Medicare and Medicaid, our investments in education, the environment, technology, and the future of the people of Florida and the United States of America.', ""And so now you will have to decide. This is part of your work because your vote will decide whether we pass our balanced budget plan and keep on bringing interest rates down and growing the Florida and the American economy and have a targeted tax cut we can afford, targeted to childrearing, to education, to buying a first-time home, to dealing with medical costs, but to do all that in a way that protects the integrity of Medicare, of Medicaid's guarantees to poor children, to families with disabilities, to seniors in nursing homes; continues to invest in giving us a world-class education; and protects our environment so that we can pave the way for the 21st century. Your vote will decide."", ""Now, they shut the Government down twice. If they had succeeded and we had caved in, we would have 3 times the cuts in Medicare that the trustees said was necessary to bail out the trust fund, costing the average senior family $268 more a year in premiums and much more in out-of-pocket costs, in copays and deductibles that had nothing to do with saving Medicare. There's not a senior citizen in Florida that's not willing to do what it takes to preserve the integrity of this program. After all, American seniors have the highest life expectancy in the world and now the lowest poverty rate on record. But I would say, folks, that is a highclass problem. Isn't that what we should be working for? People who can live longer and live better. So let's reform it, but let's don't wreck it. Your vote will decide that."", 'Their budget, if they had succeeded, would have stopped our commitment to put 100,000 police on the street, even though it\'s helping the crime rate to go down. It would have abolished the Department of Education. It would have cut college aid to thousands, hundreds of thousands of students. It would have let polluters off the hook for cleaning up their own pollution. They tried to force those cuts by shutting the Government down. In this election you have to say, ""You can shut the Government down, but you cannot shut down our future. We will not permit it.""', ""So when you vote on Tuesday, you're not just choosing a President. Your vote will determine the budget, and the budget will determine a large measure of our common future—a future with strong Medicare for our parents or not; a future where all our children can go to college or not; a future with 100,000 more police on the street or not. With your help we can build a future in which all Americans have the tools and the chance—not a guarantee but a chance— to make the most of their own lives. That is your decision. Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'Over the opposition of the leaders of the other party we passed the family and medical leave law. They said, ""Oh, this will hurt the economy; this will be a terrible burden on the economy."" We said the biggest problem working families have today is finding a way to meet their obligations at work and do their most important job, which is to raise their own children with good values and a good future and a good life. And we believe you ought to be able to take a little time off when a baby is born or a family member is sick without losing your job. That\'s what we said.', ""Well, it was just a debate before. Now we know who's right; 12 million families have taken some time off under the family leave law; we have 10.7 million more jobs—the fastest job growth, faster than any Republican administration in 70 years—and record numbers of new small businesses. We ought to expand the family leave law so people can have a little time off to go see the teachers of their children twice a year and take their family members to the doctor."", ""We passed health care reform in the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, saying you can't lose your health insurance anymore just because someone in the family is sick or you change jobs. We passed a law that said mothers and newborn babies can't be kicked out of the hospital anymore after 24 hours."", ""Your vote will decide whether to embrace the balanced budget I have recommended, which gives free mammograms to women on Medicare, which gives help for respite care for the nearly 2 million American families caring lovingly and courageously for a family member with Alzheimer's, which adds another million children to the ranks of the health insured and helps working families keep their health insurance when they are between jobs for 6 months. Your vote will decide. Will you help me build that bridge? [Applause]"", ""We've worked hard to protect our children. We've worked hard. We passed a law requiring new television sets to have a V-chip so parents could control what their young children see on television, because too much of it can be destructive for them. We have supported local school districts in things like school uniform policies, curfews, enforcement of their truancy laws. We've said if you drink and drive, you lose your license. And I'm asking every State to help me to deal with the serious problem of rising teen drug use by saying, if you want a driver's license, we want you to pass a drug test because we want to save our children from getting in trouble in the first place. We were the first administration ever to stand up to the problem that the tobacco companies cause when they market, advertise, deliver, and sell illegally tobacco to our young children. Three thousand kids a day start smoking; 1,000 will die sooner because of it. We have said no."", ""Now, on the V-chip, on the tobacco issue, we have been opposed by those from the other side. So your vote will decide. Will we stay with the V-chip? Will we stay with the fight to make our children tobacco-free? Will we stay with the safe and drug-free schools program when our opponents tried to cut it in half, when we need more people like those D.A.R.E. officers in our schools telling our kids these drugs can kill you, they're wrong, and they're dangerous? [Applause]"", 'We passed the Brady bill, the assault weapons ban, the commitment to 100,000 police. Your vote will decide whether we finish the job of putting those 100,000 police on the street, whether we target violent teen gangs, whether we ban bullets whose only purpose is to pierce the bulletproof vests of police officers. Your vote will decide, and we need your help. Will you help us build that bridge? [Applause]', ""We have reduced the welfare rolls by nearly 2 million and passed a welfare reform bill that says we'll keep giving poor people health care and food and child care when they go to work, but able-bodied people will now have to turn a welfare check into a paycheck within 2 years. It is a good law. It is a good law, but your vote will decide whether it happens, because if you don't want to hurt the children and you do want people to work, there must be work for them to do. We have a strategy to create another million jobs to move people from welfare to work. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'Your vote will decide whether we finish the job of saving the Everglades and whether we clean up 500 toxic waste sites where now 10 million American children are living within 4 miles of those toxic waste sites. Your votes will decide whether we continue to grow the economy while we preserve, indeed, improve our environment. Will you help us build a green environmental bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', 'Your vote will decide whether we open the doors of college to all Americans, whether we let people deduct the cost of a typical community college education from their tax bill so we can make 2 years of college just as universal as a high school education is today. Your vote will decide whether we give people a $10,000 tax deduction for the cost of any college tuition. Will you help us do that? [Applause]', 'Your vote will decide whether we hook every classroom in Florida up to the information superhighway so that for the first time ever the poorest, the most middle class, and the wealthiest schools in America all give their children access to the same information in the same way in the same time.', 'Forty percent of our 8-year-olds still can\'t read independently, partly because we have so many children coming here whose first language is not English. That will be cold comfort to them when they get older and they can\'t learn. We got 200,000 more work-study slots out of this recent Congress and the biggest increase in Pell grants in 20 years for college students. I\'m going to ask 100,000 of those college students to go in as volunteers as a part of a million-person corps to make sure by the year 2000 every 8-year-old can pick up a book and say, ""I can read this all by myself."" Will you help me build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]', ""So you see, my fellow Americans, this is a very important election. It will shape the way we work and live. The frontiers of knowledge are being dramatically expanded. The possibilities for people are greater than ever before. We're growing closer together with the rest of the world in ways that can enrich us as never before."", ""This is an election about country and people, not about our party. It is true that I'm a Democrat by heritage, instinct, and conviction, and as proud of it today as I have ever been in my life. But over the course of our history, at various times either party has had the job of bringing the American people and moving us together into the future. Abraham Lincoln was a Republican, but he kept our country together and helped us to abolish the curse of slavery. Theodore Roosevelt was a Republican, but he knew it was wrong for children to work 70 hours a week in factories when they ought to be in school. And he knew it was wrong to squander our natural heritage, and he knew it was wrong to let monopolies destroy the free enterprise system. He kept us together and moved us forward."", ""But today it is the responsibility of our party because of the ideas we established, because of the campaign we have run, because of the record we have made, and because of the ideas of those on the other side. They honestly believe we're better off on our own. I believe we're better off building that bridge to the future together. And you have to decide."", ""Look around this crowd today. Look around this crowd today. We have people here of all racial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds. Around the world today, people are fighting and killing each other because of their tribal, their racial, their religious, their ethnic differences. Every day we pick up the paper and see new heartbreak in Africa, hundreds of thousands of refugees driven from their homes, based on tribal fights between two tribes that cross into three nations—where people who don't have enough right now to get along with their children, instead of working together to give their children a better future, choose to kill each other and starve their children."", ""In Haiti, a dictatorship threatened the right of some of the poorest but best people in the world to live up to their own dreams. In Bosnia, where the people are literally biologically indistinguishable, they're in different so-called ethnic or religious groups by accident of history, people were willing to kill each other and their children. And in the Middle East, the Holy Land for the three great monotheistic religions of the world, one year ago tomorrow a great Prime Minister of Israel was murdered by someone in his own country who hated—hated the cause of peace more than he respected the human life of his nation's great leader."", 'In America we can beat that. The American people said no to hating the Federal Government after the awful tragedy of Oklahoma City. The American people said no to racial and religious hatred in the face of synagogues and Islamic centers being defaced and black churches being burned. We have said no, and we must say no on Tuesday to the proposition that we are all a bunch of isolated individuals. We are one nation, one community, going forward into the 21st century. Will you help us build that bridge? Will Florida be with us on Tuesday? [Applause]', 'Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you.']"
137,William J. Clinton ,"November 03, 1996","['The President. Wow! Thank you for coming out, standing in the cold, making me feel warm. Are you ready for a victory on Tuesday?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Are you ready to work until Tuesday for the victory?', 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. Let me thank the Union High School Band for their music. Let me thank you for your music. Let me thank Christina Skleros—was she fabulous or what? [Applause] She did it for the Yankees, she's doing it for Torricelli."", ""Mayor Petti, thank you for welcoming us here. Governor Florio, Mayor Del Vecchio, Larry Lerner, thank you for running for Congress— thank you both. Congressman Payne, to all the other dignitaries who are here, let me thank you so much, all of you, for being here. I want to say a special word of thanks to my great friend Whoopi Goldberg for being there for us through this whole campaign. She has always been funny, and she has always been wise. But she is becoming wiser and funnier and more effective for her country, and I'm grateful."", ""Let me thank Senator Frank Lautenberg for his work, his support, and for standing for you. And let me say a special word of thanks to Bill Bradley. We've known each other a very long time now. I remember so well when he first ran for the Senate from New Jersey. I remember so many things about his distinguished career. He made a difference for New Jersey and a difference for America. He was what we want every public official to be. We wish you well, and we thank you, Bill Bradley. Godspeed; thank you."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, I was trying to think what, if anything, I might say to all of you who are here, to the large number of undecided voters who remain, to the young people—I know we have people from Rutgers and Kean College here, and I thank you both for being here— what I might say about Bob Torricelli that would have any impact. After all, this decision is New Jersey's decision, and I am just another citizen when it comes to voting and not even a registered voter here."", 'But I know three things I would like you to know. You know, I think our politics, as I have said many times, has become too personally negative. I think that there is this overwhelming temptation that I see too much in politics to convince the voters that the other people are not only wrong, which is a legitimate thing, but bad folks. I am 2 days from the end of the last campaign I will ever run. I have been more blessed than any American in my lifetime. I have received honors from the American people that no person could rightly claim to deserve. I have done my best to make this a better country. But I have to tell you, in those 20plus years I have learned that most of the people who run for office in both parties are good, honest, hard-working people who love our country, who love their families, and who want to do what is right.', ""I must say I have—I can't say I've enjoyed but I have been awestruck by the protean battle that Congressman Torricelli and Congressman Zimmer have waged. They remind me of some battles I saw earlier in my youth when I wasn't sure either team would walk off the field."", 'But there are three things I want you to know that I know about Bob Torricelli. Number one, he is a ferocious fighter for what he believes in, and he believes in New Jersey. And you need somebody who will do that.', ""Number two, I have spent a lot of time with him in quiet, private moments when there were no cameras, no reporters, no press, no contributors, nobody from New Jersey, no one to impress, nothing to say. He has an extraordinary mind. He has an extraordinary understanding of our country. He thinks about the future. You need someone in the Senate that has the capacity to be a truly great positive force for the United States in the 21st century. Bob Torricelli could become a truly great United States Senator and a great positive force for our country and for New Jersey in the 21st century. I hope you'll give him a chance to do that."", ""But third and, for the moment, most important, it has fallen to Bob Torricelli and those of like mind and to Al Gore and to me to make the case for America's future that always has to be made at a time of great change. We're going through a huge change in the way we work and live and relate to one another and the rest of the world. I'm sure that you've seen changes here in Union Township in the way families live. I can just give you one little example: When I became President there were 3 million Americans making a living by working at home. Today, because of computer technology, there are 12 million. By the year 2000, there will be 20 million."", ""Let me give you another example. When I became President there was no known medical treatment for stroke. Medical research has developed one. Two of the genes that cause breast cancer have been discovered. We may be able to eventually cure all cases and to prevent many because of that. For the first time ever, laboratory animals with their spines completely severed have had movement in their lower legs because of nerve transplants from other parts of their bodies to the spine. We're about to build a supercomputer with IBM and the United States Government that will do more calculations in a second than you can do on your hand-held calculator in 30,000 years."", 'When Hillary and Chelsea and I went to the Olympics to welcome all the teams from around the world, there were people from 197 different racial and ethnic groups there and national groups. The United States is the only great country in the world that has people in it from virtually all of those places.', 'This is a different world. It is new. It is exciting. It is full of new changes. And every time we go through a period like that, the great question is will we meet these challenges, will we seize these opportunities in a way that helps us to live more closely to those ideals we believe in and to grow as a country together as we go forward together.', ""Bob Torricelli will help us to do that. The approach we have taken will help us to do that. The great difference here in this election is between those who believe that we're better off on our own and those of us who believe we're better off when all of us work to give each other the tools we need to make the most of our own lives and to build a better future together."", ""I do believe, as the First Lady said, it takes a village to raise a child and build a country and build a future. I do believe that we're always going to be better off when we build a bridge together to the future that's big enough and wide enough for us all to walk across. But make no mistake about it, in this last Presidential election of the 20th century and the first election of the 21st century, the decision is more important than ordinarily it is, not because of any of us but because of the sheer dimensions of the change through which we are living. We must make the right decision."", ""This is not an election of party, it is an election of nation and people. The Republican Party at times past has fulfilled this historic role for us. That's what Abraham Lincoln did when he gave his life to save the Union and to end the abominable practice of slavery. That's what Theodore Roosevelt did when he said it's wrong for children to work 70 hours in factories every week; it's wrong for them not to be in school; it's wrong to destroy our natural heritage; it's wrong for monopolies to destroy the free enterprise system. He did that. But today it is our party, it is our administration, and it is Congressman Torricelli who represent the view that we must meet these challenges together and go forward together. And that is the central issue in this election. If you doubt it, I will give you just a few examples."", ""The environmental example is an easy one for me. We have to prove we can grow the economy and preserve, indeed, enhance the environment. It is wrong, what they tried to do in their budget, to let polluters off the hook. They should pay and we should help to close all these toxic waste dumps that are compromising our children's future. We should do this together, and they should assume their responsibility."", ""Look at law enforcement. Their budget would have abolished our commitment to put 100,000 police on the street, but we have had 4 years of declining crime and the lowest crime rate in 10 years in the United States. If we can have 4 more, it might actually be safe for everybody to walk on the streets and play in all the parks and be in all the neighborhoods, and we could feel good about America's security again. We need to keep going in the direction we're going. We don't need to take a U-turn. You should stand with law enforcement and support our direction because it's right for America and it will make us a better place."", 'We need a growing economy to succeed and to do what is best for all of us. Four years ago you took me on faith in New Jersey when I said we could lower the deficit, still invest in an education, expand trade, and grow the economy. You took it on faith when I said, ""This liberal-conservative debate doesn\'t make any sense. I\'ll shrink the size of Government, but I want us to be stronger, to grow together.""', ""Now you know the evidence. We've got the smallest Federal Government since President Kennedy. We reduced more unnecessary programs and regulations than my two Republican predecessors. We privatized more Government operations than my two Republican predecessors, but we have a program that continues to invest in education, technology, and in our future. And we have 10.7 million new jobs to show for it, a 15-year high in homeownership, a 27-year low in the rates of unemployment and inflation combined."", ""This country is moving in the right direction. Help us keep it going. We don't need to take a U-turn. We need to balance the budget and have targeted tax cuts for what people really need and for the people who really need it, for education, childrearing, buying that first home, paying for health care. We don't need a big tax cut that they won't tell you how they can pay for, because it will blow a hole in the deficit, raise interest rates, and require bigger cuts in education, the environment, Medicare, and Medicaid than the ones I vetoed. So let's balance the budget, keep the economy growing, and secure the future of New Jersey's children. That's what's at stake in this election, and I want you to help us do it."", 'And finally, the biggest question of all, in a world that is changing like this, people will have to keep on learning for a lifetime. We have a program to give every child in America world-class educational opportunities, to open the doors of college to all, to hook up every classroom in America to the information superhighway so that every child in New Jersey without regard to income or race or region or national background can have access for the first time in the history of America to the same information in the same time in the same way. It will revolutionize education. Our plan is right, and their opposition to it is wrong. We need your help to build that bridge to the 21st century. We need your help.', ""We need your help to make sure that we allow families to deduct from their tax bill the cost of a typical community college tuition so everybody can have at least 2 years of education after high school, of any age. We need your help to give people a deduction for the cost of college tuition, of any kind of college tuition, so all people can go to college. We need your help to do that. And we'll get it paid back."", 'We need your help to make sure every 8year-old child in this country can read, too. I have challenged 100,000 young people to take work-study money that we just appropriated to give them, to use that money to help teach our 8-year-olds to read.', 'We can do these things, folks, but we can\'t do them if we take the philosophy embodied in the budget they signed—they passed that I vetoed. And then when I vetoed it, they shut the Government down, not once but twice, to try to force it on me. And they said, ""They will never—the President will never allow the Government to be shut down."" And I said I\'d rather you be inconvenienced for 30 days than hurt for 30 years. I will never let that happen to America. You have to decide. You have to decide.', 'So on this brisk New Jersey evening—[Laughter]—when you see the flags blowing in the breeze, those are the winds of change of the 21st century. The best days of this country are still ahead of us. The young people in this audience will have more opportunities to live out their dreams than any generation of Americans in history. We will have more opportunity to promote peace and freedom and prosperity for ourselves and the world than any generation of Americans in history.', 'But we must decide that we really believe down deep inside that there are things we must do together, and that we will all be better off if we give our people not a guarantee but a chance to become what God meant them to be and if we\'re willing to say, ""We don\'t care anything else about you; if you believe in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Bill of Rights, if you\'re willing to get up and go to work or go to school or do whatever you\'re supposed to do tomorrow, we don\'t care where you come from; we don\'t care whether you\'re rich or poor; we don\'t care what your racial or ethnic or religious background is; we don\'t need to know anything else about you. You are part of our America, and we are going to build an even greater future for the greatest country in all of human history.""', 'Give us a chance on Tuesday. Give Bob Torricelli a chance on Tuesday. Give yourselves a chance on Tuesday. We need you, New Jersey. Be there.', 'Thank you, and God bless you all.']"

I'm glad to be here."", ""Thank you, Mayor Albano, for making me feel so welcome. Thank you, Shannon O'Brien, for your remarks. Thank you, Congressman Kennedy, for warming up the crowd and for your support and your leadership. Thank you, Congressman Olver, and thank you, Congressman Neal. All three of these Members of Congress from Massachusetts stood up for America when the Government was shut down and the future of America was on the line and we were being asked to choose. We stood for your future and refused, refused to give in to the blackmail of this Congress, and they deserve your thanks forever. Thank you."", ""I want to thank all those who have performed here tonight: the West Springfield High School Band, the Pottenger School Children's Choir— they're here somewhere—and the Minutemen Marching Band. Thank you. I must say, this is the best sound effects I've ever seen. If I had another plane I'd just take them with me for the rest of the day."", ""I want to thank Senator Ted Kennedy for so many things. But you will never know what it was like these last 2 years, how close we came over and over again to having some people lose hard and give in, having some people give up on raising the minimum wage, having some people give up on finally saying that you can't lose your health insurance just because you changed jobs or somebody in your family's been sick, that we would give up on passing a law that says we're not going to let insurance companies kick women and newborn babies out of hospitals after 24 hours anymore. But Ted Kennedy never gave up. He never gave up, and he prevailed."", 'And thank you, John Kerry, for waging this long, courageous campaign many times against the odds, never giving up. Thank you for being a voice in Washington, for preserving our environment when it was out of fashion. Thank you for helping me to keep putting 100,000 police on the street when the Congress tried to stop us and we wanted a safe future for our children. Thank you for fighting a long and lonely battle for campaign finance reform. Long before it was popular you were there, and you will get everlasting credit when it becomes the law of the land next year. Thank you, John Kerry. And thank you for sponsoring our legislation to open the doors of college education to every single American. Thank you.', 'My fellow Americans, 4 years ago when Massachusetts gave me an enormous support and sent Al Gore and me to Washington to work for you, I had come to you and said we had to get our country moving, we had to change the politics of Washington, we had to stop the politics of insults and get to the politics of issues. We had to get away from the politics of division and embrace the politics of unity. We had to stop pointing our fingers at each other and ask what can we do together to get this country going in the right direction. You gave me the chance, and I came here to say thank you. Thank you for doing that.', ""Four years ago, amid a time of high unemployment, rising crime, rising frustration, and increasing division, you took a chance on me. You took me on faith, and you did not know. You've heard all these debates about where we stand and where they stand tonight. But there's one thing that hasn't been emphasized. We now have some evidence about which side is right. When I became President, the unemployment rate in Massachusetts was 7 1/2 percent. Tonight it is 4.2 percent."", ""Incomes are rising for the first time in a decade. Inequality—inequality among people who are working has gone down by the largest amount in 27 years. We have the lowest rates of poverty among senior citizens ever recorded. We have 10.7 million new jobs, record new businesses, record new exports. The United States is number one in auto production again for the first time since the 1970's. We are moving in the right direction."", 'The crime rate has come down for 4 years in a row. We have the lowest crime rate in 10 years. The welfare rolls have dropped for 4 years in a row as nearly 2 million Americans have found their way to work and greater dignity. Child support collections are up 50 percent—$4 billion a year for the children of this country.', 'We have worked hard to change the course of America and bring America together. And we have been a force for peace and freedom in the world, from the Middle East to Bosnia to Northern Ireland. And there are no Russian missiles pointed at any American children tonight for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age. We are moving in the right direction.', ""You know all the issues, but let me say to you that we are moving, at a time of great change, into a new world that we can't fully understand. We know that the frontiers of knowledge are being pushed back at a rapid rate. We know we are changing the way we work and live and relate to the rest of the world. When I became President, there were 3 million Americans working full-time and living at home and working at home. Today, 4 years later, there are 12 million Americans doing it. And 4 years from now, there will be 30 million Americans doing it."", 'When I became President, there was no known cure for stroke. Today, we have treatment for stroke because of medical research, for the first time ever. And two of the genes that cause breast cancer have been uncovered; we may be able to cure it. We are developing a supercomputer that will do more calculations in a second than you can go home tonight and do on your hand-held calculator in 30,000 years. The world is changing, my fellow Americans, and we had better make the right decisions about how to respond to that change.', ""There is too much personal negative attack in politics and too little analysis of what the basis of our differences are. Every issue that Congressman Olver, Congressman Neal, Senator Kennedy, Senator Kerry, and Congressman Kennedy mentioned—every one can be distilled into this: I believe that there are some things that we must do together as a nation to help give each other the chance to make the most of our own lives—not a guarantee but a chance. They believe you're better off on your own. That's what their budget was all about. And now you have to decide."", 'If their budget were the law of the land tonight, we would have had reductions in Medicare, cuts 3 times as great as those that were necessary to preserve the Medicare Trust Fund. It would have cost our seniors, no matter how poor, $268 more a year, plus more in out-ofpocket costs over and above that. We would have had the first cuts in student loans and Head Start in modern history. We would have had the first cuts in the Medicaid guarantee of health care to poor children, to middle class families who have family members with disabilities. Even they would have repealed the standards of quality care for seniors in nursing homes. We would have paralyzed the ability of our Government to protect the environment. We would have, in short, divided our country.', 'But they believe that that was right because they believe we\'re better off on our own. And you have to decide. They shut the Government down, not once but twice, to force these cuts on the American people. And because these Members of Congress stood with me, they said, ""Oh, you Democrats will cave in; you\'re miserable when the Government is shut down."" I said, ""This is not about Government; it\'s about people. I\'d rather see the American people inconvenienced for 30 days than irreparably damaged for 30 years. We will not give in to your cuts and your approach.""', ""So now you have to decide about tomorrow, for this election is about tomorrow. This is an election of enormous moment, with great consequences and clear choices. You should all be happy that the choices are as clear as they are. I am well aware that I am not solely responsible for the fact that we have 10.7 million more jobs. But we did our part. We cut the deficit by 63 percent. We invested in education. We expanded the ability of Americans to sell their products around the world. And we did other things to grow the economy. That's why we have those 10.7 million more jobs. We did it together. I want us to do more together. We're not better off on our own. It takes a village to raise a child and build a country and build a future."", ""So you have to decide whether we will continue our work to balance the budget and protect the medical programs that our seniors, our people with disabilities, our poorest children depend upon; continue to invest in education, in the environment, and technology; and target our tax cuts to people who need them for purposes that are needed, education and childrearing and buying a first home and dealing with a medical cost—or whether we will adopt their scheme, which will blow a hole in the deficit, require bigger cuts than the ones I vetoed, and send the economy of this State into a tailspin. Will you stand with us to build America's future and build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", ""You have to decide whether we were right to say people shouldn't lose their jobs if they have to take a little time off when a baby is born or a family member is sick and whether we shouldn't expand the family leave law to say people should be able to get a little time off to go visit their children's teachers and take their family members to the doctor. Will you help us do that? [Applause]"", ""You have to decide whether we're going to clean up 500 more toxic waste sites. You have to decide whether we're going to really implement welfare reform in the right way. It's all very well to say people have to turn a welfare check into a paycheck. I'm for that, but I want the jobs to be there. You can't make people go to work unless there's a job. We have a plan to move a million people from welfare to work. Will you help us implement it and build that bridge? [Applause]"", ""You have to decide whether we were right or they were when we passed the Brady bill and kept 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers from getting handguns. And now people who beat up their spouses and their kids won't be able to get them either. You have to decide if we were right. You have to decide whether you want us to finish the job of putting 100,000 police on the street or let them take away the police that are still to be placed. Why in the world they want to do that I don't know, but they do. You have to decide."", ""And more than anything else, you have to decide where we're going in the issues that will affect whether we can grow together. We did pass health care reform, but our balanced budget plan would give insurance to families who are between jobs for 6 months, would insure another million children, would give free mammograms to women on Medicare, would give respite care to the nearly 2 million American families caring courageously for a family member with Alzheimer's—all paid for. You get it in our balanced budget plan. They cannot do it. You have to decide. Shouldn't we do more to bring the American people together and help our families to succeed at work and at home? [Applause]"", ""And you have to decide, more than anything else, you have to decide—and this is not just a matter of this cheering crowd. Remember the changes I described in the beginning. Education will no longer be just the province of youth. It will be the work of a lifetime. It will become a part of everyone's work life. We will have to learn and learn and learn. And we must begin to create an education system for the 21st century that gives every American child and every American adult the finest educational opportunities in the world. We cannot do it with their approach. They want to abolish the Department of Education. I want to give you world-class education, and you have to decide. You have to decide."", ""Thanks to Senator Kennedy and Senator Kerry and others, we got 200,000 more workstudy positions for college students in this last budget. Here's what I want to do with half of those. And I want to ask you college students that have been cheering tonight, I want to ask you to help me. We have improved the student loan program. We've given 70,000 of our young people a chance to serve in AmeriCorps in their communities and earn their way to college. We have increased Pell grants by the largest amount in 20 years. But we must do more."", 'But we have to start with our young children. Do you know that 40 percent of the kids in this country can still not read a book on their own by the age of 8? It may be because we have so many people whose first language is not English. But that will be cold comfort to them as they move through school and fail to learn. I have a plan to mobilize a million volunteers to go into all the land to help parents and teachers teach our children to read. And I want 100,000 of those work-study slots to go to college students who will earn work-study by teaching children to read. Will you help do that? Will you be one of them? [Applause] By the year 2000, I want every 8-year-old in America to be able to pick up a book and say, ""I can read this all by myself."" Will you help us do it? [Applause]', 'Will you help us hook up every classroom and every library and every school in Massachusetts, the smallest rural school, the poorest inner-city school to the information superhighway so that for the first time in the history of America, every single child—poor, rich, or middle class, urban, rural, or suburban—every child for the first time will have access to the same knowledge in the same way in the same time? We can revolutionize the education of our children. Will you help us do it? [Applause]', 'Will you help us open the doors of college to all by saying we will give Americans a dollarfor-dollar reduction on their tax bill for the cost of a typical community college tuition so every American of any age can have at least 2 more years of education as universal as high school is today in the next 4 years? Will you help us? [Applause]', ""Will you help us to give America's families a $10,000 tax deduction a year for the cost of college tuition at any institution of higher education, graduate or undergraduate, in the United States? Will you help us? [Applause]"", ""And most important of all, remember now, you may have your mind made up, but not everybody does. These are the choices at stake. It's not Senator Kerry and his opponent, President Clinton and Bob Dole, Democrats versus Republicans. It has fallen to our party and our administration at this moment in history to represent the idea that America must always put forward at a time of great change. Whenever we go through changes, we have the option to be more divided or more united. Whenever we have gone through changes, we've had the option to try to make sure everyone could prosper so we could move closer to our ideals."", 'This is not about money. It\'s about using the resources of America to enable people to live up to their God-given capacities. And you must decide. The great idea is whether we are going to give each other the conditions and tools to give everybody a chance to make the most of their own lives, or whether we will say, ""You\'re on your own."" The great idea is whether we will say, ""There\'s the 21st century out there, America\'s best days, the time of greatest possibility in human history. Yes, there\'s a big river to ford and a deep valley to go into and a high mountain to climb; I hope you get there."" Or would you prefer our approach, where we all roll up our sleeves, without regard to race, religion, gender, you name it, and say, ""If you will work hard and do your part, we will together build a bridge to the 21st century wide enough and strong enough to take us to America\'s best days."" Will you do that? [Applause] Will you be there Tuesday? [Applause] Will you be there between now and Tuesday and bring your friends? [Applause]', ""God bless you. Thank you, Massachusetts. I'll see you Tuesday. Thank you.""]"
139,William J. Clinton ,"November 04, 1996","['The President. Thank you. Thank you, Bangor. Thank you, Maine. Thank you, John Bapst High School Band. The Basin Street All Women Dixieland Band, thank you.', ""Ladies and gentlemen, here we are. I want to thank your mayor for welcoming me when I came here, my longtime friend Libby Mitchell for her work in our campaign. Thank you, Congressman John Baldacci, for being a great leader for Maine and a great Congressman for America. I can tell you that if everyone in Congress had the same attitude, values, and work habits as your Congressman does, we wouldn't have half the problems we've got in Washington, DC, today. And you should be very proud of him."", 'Ladies and gentlemen, this is the first rally of the last day of the last campaign I will ever run, and I am glad to start it here with you.', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', 'The President. Thank you. Thank you. In the last few days I have been in much warmer weather—[laughter]—in Arizona and Nevada, southern California, El Paso, Las Cruces, New Mexico, San Antonio, Little Rock, New Orleans. I woke up this morning, believe it or not— or yesterday morning—in Tampa, Florida, and then I went to West Palm Beach and then I went to New Jersey and to Springfield, Massachusetts, and here we are.', 'I want you to know that I came here for three reasons. First, and in some ways most important, to say a simple thank you to the people of Maine for giving me a chance to serve as President, for taking a chance on me and giving me a chance to serve.', ""I owe so much to so many people here. And I would be remiss if I did not say a special word of thanks to my good friend Senator George Mitchell, who's not here tonight, because, as I'm sure all of you know, he played Senator Dole in our debates and he prepared me; he won every time. [Laughter] But because he prepared me so well, I think it worked out all right when the debates came along."", 'George Mitchell is now, as all of you know, working hard on the peace talks with Northern Ireland to try to continue the effort we have made to resolve the differences there between the Irish Catholics and the Irish Protestants, between the loyalists and the unionists and the republics. We believe that we can see a peace in Ireland in our lifetime. And if it happens, everybody in Maine can take a lot of pride in knowing that George Mitchell played a pivotal, pivotal role. And I thank him for that.', 'The second reason I came here is because I wanted to stand one last time with my friend of many years, my former colleague as a Governor, a person I like, a person I admire, a person I earnestly hope you will elect to the United States Senate, Joe Brennan.', ""I got to thinking on the way up here that the people of Maine are as independent as the people of my home State of Arkansas are, and they're bound to think they have enough sense to choose their own Senator. And you don't need me to tell you how to vote. But I'll tell you this: I've known Joe Brennan for years and years. I've talked to him late at night when there were no cameras around, when there was no one to impress, no points to score, years ago when neither one of us could ever have foreseen that we might be standing here today. I know about his love for his children, his love for this State, his profound belief in education. I know how hard he has worked all of his life to uphold the highest standards in public service. I know and I can see it in his eyes tonight, bone weary from all this campaigning in this tight race, he still burns with a passion to serve you. And he will serve you well if you will give him a chance to do that."", ""And the third reason I came here tonight also relates to Joe, and that is to tell you that we're really very fortunate in this election we're going to have tomorrow, on Tuesday, because it's an election of enormous consequence with a very clear choice. And you really have to decide on the big choice. It's more important than the people involved and far more important than the political parties involved."", ""Once a generation or so, our country goes through such a period of profound change that we are powerless to stop the changes. And the only issue is whether we will respond to the changes in the appropriate way. Will we take advantage of this moment in history, to be able to live in a way that will make us more prosperous, that will make us feel our lives have greater meaning because we'll be able to live more closely to the values we all say we believe in, that will enable us to move forward together?"", ""You know, there are a lot of people here, I take it, from the University of Maine since you're not very far away. Let me just say to all of you, you know this, but the world you are about to enter is changing more rapidly in terms of the way people work and live and relate to each other and the rest of the world than perhaps at any time certainly in modern history. It's been at least 100 years when we moved, basically, from farm to factory and from the country to the city, when America changed this much. And on top of that, we're not only moving to an economy suffused with technology in every way, we're becoming more and more involved in the rest of the world. And all of our patterns are being changed and a lot of challenges are out there."", ""I ran for President 4 years ago because I wanted to create opportunity for every American in this new world; because I wanted every American to be a responsible citizen in this new world and I didn't think we had to tolerate continually rising rates of crime and social division and family and community background, I thought we could do something about it; and because I wanted to see us come together instead of being divided as an American community. That is still the challenge today. That is the bridge I seek to build to the 21st century, one we can all walk across together."", ""But the great choice before you here tonight is very clear. It may be muddied up with the ads and the charges and all that, but I'm telling you, you can see from what has happened in Washington in the last 2 years, from the budget they passed that I vetoed that Governor Brennan's opponent supported, what the issue is. The issue is whether you believe that we're better off on our own or whether you believe we are better off if we work together to create the conditions and give people the tools to make the most of their own lives—not a guarantee but a chance to live up, every one of you, to your God-given potential. That's what I believe. That's what I believe."", 'And I just want to say a couple of things about it. First of all, it\'s not like you don\'t have any evidence. When I brought this approach to Washington and I said, ""I\'m tired of all that political rhetoric and all that name-calling and liberal-this, conservative-that, Democrat, Republican,"" I said, ""I\'m tired of pointing fingers. I want us to work together to make this country a better place. And I\'ll work with anybody who will work with me."" And I couldn\'t get a single, solitary soul on the other side to help us with our economic plan. They said, ""Oh, it will bring the economy down."" Well, now we know. Four years later we have 10.7 million new jobs and we have the lowest average inflation in 30 years, the lowest average unemployment in 20 years, the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in America. We\'re moving in the right direction, folks. Our approach is right, and they were not when they didn\'t support it.', 'I said we can lower the crime rate if we put 100,000 police on our street. We don\'t have to tolerate the crime rate going up year-in and year-out. We can mobilize citizens to work with the police officers and work in neighborhoods block by block. We even arranged to get 50,000 phones out there, cell phones for neighborhood watch groups to work with these police. I said we can do this. And they ridiculed me. They said, ""Oh, you\'ll never put those police on the street."" They must have believed it because they tried to stop me from doing it two or 3 times. But now we know. We\'ve had 4 years of declining crime, the lowest crime rate in America in 10 years. If we do it for 4 more years everybody in America might start to feel safe again, and that would be a good thing for the children of this country.', 'I said I believe we can move people from welfare to work and still be good to their children. And we have reduced the welfare rolls by nearly 2 million and increased child support collections by almost 50 percent, $4 billion a year, and given a tax credit for people who will adopt a child, which is a very good thing to do—$5,000. I hope more children will find homes as a result of it.', 'And all this was different. But every step of the way it was more partisan than it should have been because they said no. And then they won the Congress in 1994, and we saw what they wanted to do.', ""Do you believe you're better off on your own, and is it all right if we're apart? Or do you believe we should help each other and grow and go forward together? That's what that budget fight was all about."", ""They said they were even going to give people like me a big tax cut though I didn't need it. And they were going to pay for it by cutting Medicare by 3 times as much as had to be cut to preserve the Medicare program. They were going to withdraw, after 30 years, the guarantee of the Medicaid program of health care to the elderly in nursing homes. They were even going to get rid of the standards for care in our nursing homes. They were going to withdraw the guarantee of health care to middle class families who have family members with disabilities. They were going to cut education, college loans, and Head Start for the first time in modern history and paralyze our ability to protect the environment."", ""Now, they said a lot of nice things about it and a lot of bad things about us personally. But that's the fact. That's what they were going to do. They were even going to raise taxes on 8 million of the hardest pressed working people in this country and allow corporate executives to raid their workers' pension funds after all that horrible experience we had in the 1980's. We certainly have learned that we have to protect pension funds. I've worked hard to do that."", 'And I said no. And then they cut the—shut the Government down. And I said no. So, they shut the Government down again. But because John Baldacci and others stood with me, they were not able to impose that budget on the American people. They said, ""Oh, you can\'t bear to shut the Government down."" And I said, ""Shut the Government down. I\'d rather see us inconvenienced for 30 days than damaged for 30 years."" I\'m glad we did that. But now you get to decide—you get to decide whether you believe that we\'d be better off in Maine and Arkansas and other places in the country being cut loose or whether you think we ought to do some things together.', ""But let me tell you what this is not. This is not about liberal and conservative. Our administration has the most fiscally conservative record in modern history. We're the first administration to reduce the deficit in all 4 years of our term in the 20th century. It is now 63 percent lower than it was when we took office. Our Government is the smallest it's been since President Kennedy came here to campaign. Our record in abolishing regulations and unnecessary programs and privatizing programs exceeds that of my two Republican predecessors. It's not about conservative or liberal, it's about whether we have an obligation to do some things together."", ""So you get to decide what we should do together. That's what this election for the Senate is about. Joe Brennan is a friend of mine and he's a good man and he'll serve you well. And I hope he gets elected. But the real reason you ought to vote for him is because it's better for you, your children, your future, the future of Maine, and the future of the United States of America. And you get to decide."", ""On the budget you've got a clear choice: You can follow our plan with 4 years of evidence and go on and balance the budget, give targeted tax cuts for education, childrearing, health care, and homebuying, and protect Medicare and Medicaid, education, and the environment or you can have this big old tax scheme which sounds good but actually raises taxes on 9 million hard-working people, requires bigger cuts in education than the ones I vetoed, and will blow a hole in the deficit and weaken our economy, but it'll cut us all loose. I say let's go forward together, build that bridge, and balance that budget. Will you help Joe Brennan and me to do that? [Applause] Will you do that? Come on, I can't hear you. [Applause]"", 'Your vote will decide if we continue our efforts to help our families succeed at home and at work. I have been from corner to corner in this country, and everywhere I go—talking to families of all income levels—I find that the biggest challenge so many people face is how to fulfill their responsibilities at work and then do their most important job, which is to be good parents to their children. The average American working family is spending more hours on the job today than their predecessors were 25 years ago. Most parents work, and most parents have to work. Therefore, it is incumbent upon us to design a society in which people can succeed at the most important work of all, being good parents, and also do very well at work. That is important.', 'That\'s why I fought for the family and medical leave law. The leaders of the other party fought against it. Now, they said—to be fair to them, they honestly believed it was wrong; Senator Dole believed it was wrong—they said, ""It will hurt the economy because we ought to leave people alone and let them do whatever they want to do. And I hope they\'ll do the right thing."" He wasn\'t mean about it; he hoped they would do it. I said, ""If you want people to be able to do it without getting hurt by their competitors who aren\'t doing it, you have to set some rules and let us all play by those rules.""', ""Well, now we've got some evidence. Three years later we've got 12 million families who got to take some time off when their babies were born or their family members were sick. We've got record numbers of new businesses, record numbers of exports, and 10.7 million new jobs. Our approach is right; it will make America stronger. And we should expand family leave to help parents take time off to go see their children's teachers twice a year and take their family members to the doctor. Joe Brennan will help. Will you help? [Applause]"", 'Your vote will decide whether we continue to try to help keep our children safe from drugs and tobacco and gangs and guns. We have tried to put people in every school in America saying drugs are wrong, drugs are illegal, drugs can kill you, with the safe and drug-free school program. They say they are tough on drugs, but they cut the program in half. And I stopped them, and we restored it. But we have more to do.', ""We were the first administration ever to say to the big tobacco companies, you have to stop marketing your cigarettes illegally to children. And they opposed me. They opposed me. But 3,000 kids a day start smoking; 1,000 will die earlier because of it. I think we did the right thing. We're in the middle of that. You will decide by your votes for the Senate and your vote for President whether you want us to continue the safe and drug-free schools program, the anti-teen-tobacco initiative, the initiatives that we're taking to put more police officers on the street, which they have consistently opposed and which they will have to undermine in their budget. It is your decision."", ""So this is not about Joe Brennan or Bill Clinton or John Baldacci. It's about what you want for your kids, your families, your communities, and your future. Will you help us on Tuesday to keep going in the right direction? [Applause]"", 'And the most important thing of all, the most important thing of all is that everybody understand that even in this great State of Maine— which has the highest percentage of timberland of any State in the country, a State I have vacationed in and traveled across and come to love, a State like mine which still has a lot of agricultural and natural resource income—we will be dominated by technology, by computers, by a global economy, by information. We will decide whether we shape it in a way that helps us to build strong families, good careers, and good futures or whether it shapes us in a way that undermines our hopes and dreams. We will decide. That is why the decision about how we will go about the business of educating the American people is perhaps the most fundamental decision before us in this election. Now, I have offered a program to the American people that will do many things. But I want you to think about three of them because they have particular relevance to Maine.', ""Number one, 40 percent of the 8-year-olds in this country still can't read independently by the time they get to the third grade. I have a plan to mobilize a million volunteers, including 100,000 college students we'll pay work-study funds to do it, to teach these children to read. Do you believe we should do that? [Applause] Will the students here help us do that? [Applause]"", ""Number two, especially important to rural States like Maine and my home State of Arkansas, I have a plan to hook up every classroom and every library and every school in the entire United States of America to the information superhighway by the year 2000. Now, what this means—for all of you older folks like me out there that aren't computer whizzes, let me tell you what that means. It means that for the first time in the history of America kids in the smallest rural districts, kids in the poorest innercity districts, rich kids, poor kids, middle class kids, city kids, rural kids, suburban kids, for the first time ever they'll all have access to the same information in the same way at the same time. It will revolutionize education in America. Will you help us to do it? [Applause] I can't hear you. Will you do it? [Applause]"", ""Finally, we must open the doors of college education to all Americans of any age who are willing to go. I want to make 2 years of education after high school as universal as a high school diploma is today in the next 4 years. We can do that with no bureaucracy and no program simply by telling the American people they can deduct dollar for dollar from their tax bill the cost of a typical community college tuition for 2 years. I want to let you save in a IRA more than before, but withdraw from that retirement account without any penalty if you're using the money for education, medical emergencies, buying a first-time home. And, finally, I want to give every American family a deduction of up to $10,000 a year for the cost of any college tuition. It will change the face of America. Now, believe me, that is our program. That is not their program. They cannot do that."", 'They can\'t fund our health care initiatives which is in our balanced budget to give families that are unemployed 6 months of insurance when they\'re between jobs, to give free mammograms to women on Medicare, to give respite care to the nearly 2 million families that are lovingly and courageously caring for family members with Alzheimer\'s, to add another million kids to the ranks of those with health insurance. They can\'t do that, either. It\'s not in their program because they have a ""you\'re on your own"" program: bigger cuts than the ones I vetoed, blowing a hole in the deficit, walking away from our common responsibilities.', ""You don't have to believe they're bad people. I don't like all this negative stuff about a lot of our campaigns. We just have different ideas."", ""You have to decide in Maine whether you believe we are right or they are right. And I'm telling you, you at least have some evidence, because compared to 4 years ago we're in better shape than we were then. But you know we've still got a lot of work to do to create opportunity for all Americans, to build a community in which we're all a part, to have responsible citizens everywhere and every community doing their part."", ""Will you help us on Tuesday to elect Joe Brennan? [Applause] Will you help us on Tuesday to build a bridge to the 21st century? [Applause] Will Maine lead the way into a bright new era, America's best days? [Applause] I need you. I can't hear you. Say it! [Applause]"", 'Thank you. God bless you. Thank you.']"
140,William J. Clinton ,"November 04, 1996","['The President. Thank you.', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', 'The President. Thank you.', 'Audience member. Nice tie! [Laughter]', 'The President. Thank you. I sort of like this tie myself. Thank you. It was given to me just this morning. [Laughter]', 'A couple of weeks ago we were trying to plan how we would end this campaign—I hope I can say this without cracking up. [Laughter] And I said I would like to begin the last day of my last campaign in New Hampshire.', ""Five years and one month ago today I came to New Hampshire saying that the world was changing, America was changing, and that we couldn't stay with the old politics, that our country was being paralyzed by all this name-calling and rhetoric out of Washington, dividing us when we needed to be pulling together, and thinking about all the incredible opportunities as well as the stiff challenges we faced. And I believed that if we changed the nature of politics in our Nation's Capital we could change America and we could come together and move forward, that we could create more opportunity and have more responsibility and we could come together in an American community. That's what I believed."", 'Four years ago, all over this State, all kinds of people took me on faith. You heard what Dick Swett said, we are better off than we were 4 years ago. We are moving in the right direction because of what he did. And a different kind of tone has overtaken the politics of New Hampshire. I was so happy and proud when I stood here on this stage this morning and I listened to Arnie and Joe and Dick and Jeanne Shaheen talk about what they wanted to do and why they were running and what they represented.', ""And I heard, I guess it was Joe who said Warren Rudman said that the Democrats had become the moderate party. I think the Democrats have become the modern party as well, the party of the future. America has always needed—at times of great changes in how we work and live and relate to each other and the rest of the world—a modern, moderate party, a commonsense but vital, vigorous, centrist party moving this country forward. That's what you see on this stage."", ""And I was so proud—I heard Arnie speaking and she reminded me this morning that I first met her in an elevator here before the Democratic Convention in the '92 campaign and she didn't know me, but then no one else did either. [Laughter] And I was thinking how far Joe Keefe has come, how greatly he's matured, what a terrific speech he made. And they're going to be terrific Members of the Congress if you'll stick with them tomorrow and help them."", ""I was thinking that the first time I ever met Jeanne Shaheen I thought she was a diamond waiting to be discovered, that if the people ever really got a good look at her, they would want her to serve in higher office. You have given her that chance, and tomorrow you're going to make her your Governor. And it will be a good time for New Hampshire."", 'First time I met Dick Swett and Katrina and their children—you have to come to New Hampshire every 9 months if you want to meet all their children. [Laughter] I thought—somebody asked me today, ""You know, you\'re the first President in history ever to come to New Hampshire eight times in your term of office."" I said, ""Well, I\'ve got to keep up with Dick\'s family."" [Laughter] I thought to myself, this man is the walking embodiment of family values.', ""You remember back in '92 we had a toast and roast to raise money for the party, and you all virtually extorted all this money out of those of us who were running for President; you knew we'd show up and say nice things about Dick Swett. He knew that he could do very well in his campaign, raising money with all the candidates, showing up at the toast and roast. I stood up and said that I didn't come here to heap praise on him like all these panderers did who were running against me for President. I came up here to wipe his windshield on his car. [Laughter]"", ""I want to say to you that Dick Swett stood for reducing the deficit, reducing the crime rate, for making Congress live under the same laws it imposes on the American people before it was the popular thing to do—before it was the popular thing to do. He would be a positive, uniting force in Congress, not a divisive, rancorous force. He would be a force for generosity, for the better part of the spirit of the people of New Hampshire, for the better part of your future, not a force telling you how bad this person or the other one or the other one is, but a person who would be bringing us together. I'm telling you, that's what we need more than anything in America today. We need to stop the insults and get on the issues and building our future and going forward, and that's what Dick Swett would be."", 'Now, you know that compared to 4 years ago, in terms of the economy, the lowest crime rate in 10 years, declining welfare rolls, rising child support collection, in almost every way of indicating the character of American life, we are moving forward into the 21st century.', ""You don't have to take me on faith anymore; you don't have to say, well, that sounds like a good approach. We tried our approach, and they have fought it every step of the way. And you know which one works. And New Hampshire is now a living example of what happens when we work together to help each other make the most of our own lives. And make no mistake about it, that is what is at issue here. With all these big, big issues we fought about—when you hear us talking about the budget or education or the environment, the fundamental core issue is whether there are some things on the edge of this great new century and new millennium we must do together. If we want every American to have a chance to live up to his or her God-given ability, if we want America to be the strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity in the world, if we want America to be a community that's growing together and going forward together, there are some things we must do together."", 'One thing we have, I hope, dispelled in New Hampshire and throughout America is that this has nothing to do with liberal and conservative. It is our administration that has reduced the deficit 4 years in a row for the first time in the 20th century. The Government is the smallest it\'s been since John Kennedy came to New Hampshire as the President of the United States. We have reduced more programs and regulations and privatized more Government services than our Republican predecessors. But we believe there are some things we must do together. They say, ""You\'re on your own."" We say, ""Let\'s build a bridge to the 21st century together that we can all walk across together."" All of these issues are in that one choice.', ""And let me say this goes beyond party, too. At every point of great change in the history of this Nation someone has to step up and say we're going to meet this challenge and we're going to go forward together. And when we do we will be living closer to our ideals. It hasn't always been the Democratic Party; Abraham Lincoln gave his life to save the Union and end slavery. Theodore Roosevelt devoted his Presidency to making America change in a way that would help to preserve and enhance our values in the face of the industrial revolution. It was Roosevelt who said it's wrong for these children to be working 70 hours a week in factories when they ought to be in school; that it's wrong to tear up all of our natural resources; it's wrong to let monopolies destroy every small-business person in the country and end the free enterprise system. It hasn't always been the Democratic Party."", ""But you remember what they did on the other side when they had the majority in Congress. They passed a budget that was divisive, destructive, and would have taken us back to the past. It is now our responsibility to keep on this path that I charted with you in New Hampshire in 1992 because we are the only people who are out there advocating that. That's why we need Arnie Arnesen; that's why we need Joe Keefe; that's why we need Dick Swett; and Jeanne Shaheen in the Governor's office. That's why we need them."", ""Your vote is going to decide whether you return to the Congress the majority of people who were prepared to shut the Government down unless we agreed to dismantle the Medicaid program, to revoke the national standards—even the standards on the quality of nursing home care—revoke the commitment we've had for 30 years to provide health care to families with members with severe disabilities so they could continue to live middle class lifestyles as they worked hard. Your vote will decide that."", ""They voted for a budget that cut education— student loans to Head Start—for the first time in modern history, that for the first time in 25 years abandoned our national bipartisan commitment to preserving the environment and instead put shackles on our ability to preserve clean air and clean water. And when we wouldn't accept it, they shut the Government down twice. Now, that was their approach. They said my approach was wrong, but you see what the results are."", ""You know now what our approach is. You know now what their approach is. The choice is there for you. Are we going to finish the job of balancing the budget while investing in our children and protecting Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment, or blow a hole in the deficit? Your vote will decide. Your vote will decide whether we will let the family leave law wither on the vine because they oppose it, or expand it and say, you know, you ought to be able to take a little time off from work without losing their jobs to go see your children's teacher twice a year and take your family members to the doctor."", ""Your vote will decide whether we continue our work of putting 100,000 police on the street. Remember when I was here in Manchester not very long ago, visiting the neighborhood where the crime rate had been lowered because there were more police on the street? They opposed us in putting 100,000 police on the street. Then they said it would never happen. Well, we've now funded about half of them. They voted against it. Then they eliminated it in their budget. Then they tried to shrink it again. They do not believe that we should work together. I can't think of anything more important than to make our children and our families safe on their streets, in their schools, in their homes, in their neighborhoods, reclaiming our streets for law-abiding citizens."", ""Your vote will decide. Your vote will decide whether we continue to support the safe and drug-free schools program. The only indicator in this country right now, social indicator that's not going in the right direction, with welfare down and crime down and out-of-wedlock pregnancy down for the first time in 20 years and child support collections up and drug use overall down and cocaine use down 30 percent—the only indicator that's not going in the right direction is drug use by young people under 18. I have done my best to dramatically increase the programs at the grassroots level helping people to tell our kids drugs are illegal, drugs are wrong, drugs will kill you. The safe and drugfree schools program is putting people in uniforms before young children at early ages to give them a chance to stay out of trouble in the first place. But they cut the program dramatically. I will expand it. I believe we have a common interest in helping schools all over America to reach our children at an early age, to support the values we should all be communicating and keeping our kids out of trouble. Your vote will decide. Your vote will decide."", 'Your vote will decide whether we or they are right when I supported and initiated and they opposed the first effort ever by our National Government to tell the big tobacco companies they had to stop advertising, marketing, and distributing cigarettes illegally to children because 3,000 a day start smoking and 1,000 will die soon because of it. Your vote will decide.', '[At this point, an audience member required medical attention.]', ""The President. Yes, we need a doctor here. My medical team's here. We'll be right there."", ""You will have to decide that. And folks—yes, here they are. You will have to decide that. And I want you, when you walk out of here today, to remember everything that's happened in this country since I first came here in 1992. Remember that and think about it tomorrow when you get up. And think about these four fine people behind me and think about what your responsibilities are. You have a chance to seize the most brilliant future in American history. The best days of this country are still to be lived. But we have to make the right decisions. And you have to make the right decisions."", ""In what I suppose has become the most famous of my political speeches, I said in Dover, New Hampshire, in 1992 that if you would give me a chance to be President, I would be with you until the last dog dies. Now, folks, there's a lot of life in this old dog. And I want you to seize this day for our children, for our future, for the right sort of policies especially in education. We're going to open the doors of college education to all. We're going to hook up all these classrooms to the Internet. We're going to teach all of our young children to read. We're going to continue to reform health care so that more and more and more Americans can afford it and don't lose it when they're in difficult circumstances. We're going to continue to grow this economy while we balance the budget and protect the environment."", ""These are the things we can do together. We're going to continue to make our streets safe and our children's future brighter if you will seize the day and help us build that bridge to the 21st century."", ""God bless you, New Hampshire. Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow. Thank you.""]"

I want to say, here on this last day of this campaign, how profoundly grateful I am and how profoundly grateful I know that Hillary is to have had the partnership we have enjoyed with Al and Tipper Gore. He is clearly the finest Vice President in the history of the United States. I want to say, in ways that you can never know, they have represented our country with honor and distinction and made America a better place.', ""I thank Mayor White for his leadership of this great city, a city that is moving in the right direction.

It's about time they got back together. And that's what we're about, bringing people back together, and I think we did it today. And I want to say a special word of thanks to Dennis Kucinich and Tom Coyne for running for the Congress, to give it back to you, to the people of Ohio and the people of America. Stand up, guys. Give them a hand. [Applause]"", ""Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the issues debated. You've heard all of the specifics argued. But you know from what the Vice President has said, you know from your own experience that the choice you make tomorrow for the last President of the 20th century and the first President of a new century and a new millennium is a choice about how we will go forward into the 21st century."", 'All the young people who are here, I especially thank you for coming because this is about your future. You know what this choice is about. It\'s about whether we\'re going to go forward on our own or whether we\'re going to go forward together. It\'s about whether we\'re going to say, ""There\'s a future out there and it\'s a long way out there and you\'ve got to ford a big river and go down a big, deep valley and climb a high mountain; we sure hope you make it; call or write when you get there""—[Laughter]—or whether we think we\'ll do better, all of us, if we work together to give everyone the tools they need, the chance—not a guarantee but a chance—to make the most of our own lives and build that bridge to the 21st century together.', 'Now, we have talked a lot in this campaign about my responsibilities to create more opportunity, to reinforce responsible conduct among young people and families and communities, to bring us together in an American community. Today I want to talk about your responsibility, for in this great country of ours you are the boss and we are your servants. And our contract is coming due.', ""It is up to you to decide whether we're going to keep building that bridge to the future or build a bridge to the past; up to you to decide whether we'll be left on our own or whether we'll go forward together; up to you to decide whether all these signs here that say Irish-Americans, Hungarian-Americans, Greek-Americans, the African-Americans, the Hispanic-Americans, the Asian-Americans, the Middle Arab-Americans—all the people that are in this audience, whether we are part of one America going forward together.

They have the votes they need to win the White House""—you remember that. You took us on faith then, but now you don\'t have to. You know whether their approach or our approach works.

We're not like they are. Even they are part of our America. We're not running anybody off. We're glad to have you here. Make them feel welcome."", ""And besides, I want to thank Senator Dole for something. He made a great speech for my reelection the other day. You know, we had a report we were at 10 1/2 million new jobs in the last 4 years. And then last week it came out that we had another 210,000 new jobs, for 10.7 million jobs—faster job growth than any Republican administration since the 1920's. And when that happened, when that happened Senator Dole said we had the worst economy in 20 years. Now, why is that a speech? Because just 2 weeks before, he said we had the worst economy in 100 years. Now, who else do you know who could make up 80 years in 2 weeks? We're moving in the right direction. We're going to the 21st century. We need to bear down and go on. We're going."", ""I agree with everything the Vice President said except one. The first decision you make is whether we continue our historic efforts in reducing the debt and bringing down interest rates and growing the economy by balancing the budget of the United States in a way that protects our investments in education, the environment, technology, and protects the people on Medicare and Medicaid and gives a targeted tax cut we can afford for education, childrearing, buying a first home, and health care—that's our plan—or whether we'll go back to their plan, the one that led to our veto. Their new version is even worse: a bigger deficit, bigger cuts, and tax increases on 8 million hard-working Americans. You have to decide."", 'Now, you heard the Vice President say they joined hands and jumped off the cliff together in that last Congress. That\'s not what they did; they joined hands and tried to push you off the cliff together. But with the help of John Glenn and Lou Stokes and Sherrod Brown, we reached out a lifeline. We said, ""You can shut the Government down if you want."" They said, ""We\'ll bring the President to his knees. We will shut the Government down."" And I said, ""I would far rather see the American people hurt for 30 days than hurt for 30 years. You shut her down. You\'re not going to force that budget down our throat.""', ""But now, folks, I have done all I can do. It's in your corner now, and you must seize the day. You'll decide whether we balance the budget and protect our priorities and invest in our future, or whether we adopt their risky scheme and wreck our economy. You will decide whether they were right or I was right when I signed the family and medical leave law and they, Mr. Dole and Mr. Gingrich, led the fight against it. They said when I signed it, this is a terrible thing, this will hurt the economy. Well, we know now, 12 million people got to take a little time off from work when a baby was born or a family member was sick. We've had record new businesses, record exports, 10.7 million new jobs, incomes going up $1,600 in the last 2 years alone. Family leave made us a stronger economy by helping people be happy at work because they knew their kids were all right at home. We did the right thing, and they were wrong."", ""So you have to decide.

Your vote will decide. Will you seize the day tomorrow and help us expand family leave? [Applause] Will you seize the day and help us balance the budget? [Applause]"", ""Your vote will decide whether we continue to reform health care. There along toward the end of the Congress, finally some of the reforms we had been advocating passed because they knew they were coming home to face you. And so now we can say, finally you can't lose your health insurance just because you change jobs or someone in your family has been sick. Finally insurance companies can't kick mothers and their newborn babies out of the hospital after 24 hours. But in our budget—in our budget, our balanced budget, we give health insurance to another million children, free mammograms to women on Medicare, respite care for the nearly 2 million families that are heroically caring for a family member with Alzheimer's, struggling against all the odds. We do all that and give families who lose their jobs 6 months more of health insurance while they're between jobs. We still balance the budget. They don't, we do. That's why they're screaming. You've got to seize the day and help us reform health care. You've got to seize the day."", ""You have to decide. We had a huge fight over crime. We had an approach on crime which Senator Glenn and Congressman Stokes and Congressman Brown supported.

That's our strategy. We'll work."", ""We passed a crime bill to put 100,000 police on the street, take assault weapons off the streets, double the funds for safe and drug-free schools so our kids will get the message early that drugs are illegal and wrong and can kill you.

In all three of those initiatives, the safe and drug-free schools initiative, the Vchip, the antitobacco initiative—they\'re all in process now; none are finished; they can all be reversed—they disagree with us. You have to decide.

Child support collections are up 50 percent; $4 billion a year is going to children who need it. We passed a $5,000 tax credit to encourage families to adopt children. There are so many of them who need homes out there. Will you help us finish the job on welfare reform? The law says if you're able-bodied, within 2 years you have to turn the welfare check into a paycheck. But you cannot require people to go to work unless there is work for them to have. We have a plan to create another million jobs to move people from welfare to work. Will you help us? Will you seize the day to do that?

Our plan recognizes that too many 8-year-olds in this country still can't read. And I propose to mobilize a million volunteers, including 100,000 college students we pay workstudy funds to, to teach every 8-year-old in the country to read independently by the third grade in the year 2000.

Let me ask you—wait, wait, folks. If you pay attention to him, you're just rewarding him. So why don't we make a deal and we'll ignore him. I have a totally different attitude about this than a lot of people do. I always welcome people from the opposition to our rallies, because unlike them, my America includes everybody who's willing to work hard. And I'm always glad to see them."", ""I'm always even willing to sort of be quiet and let them talk, but they never want to stop, because what they really want is to stop me from talking and you from hearing. And if I was running against the record we've established and the ideas for the future, and I had to carry that budget I vetoed around on my back the way they do, maybe I'd be trying to shout my opponents down, too, but I hope not. I hope not."", ""So we've had enough smear and smear and smear, and why don't we just take a few minutes on this beautiful, beautiful fall night in Kentucky to think about our future. And if we get interrupted, let's just keep thinking about our future."", ""I want to thank all the young people who came here tonight, especially, because the election is more about you than anyone else. I want to thank all the entertainers who came: Kevin Cronin, the Central Kentucky Youth Orchestra, Carol and Vanessa Det, Black Voices, and the marching bands of Harrison County, Nicholson County, Mercer County, and Lafayette County. Thank you very much. Thank you, Ashley Judd, for coming. Thank you. Now, Coach Pitino, we're both defending our titles, and maybe I'll see you in the White House again next year."", ""Let me say on this beautiful day, what is really at stake here, clearly, beyond any doubt, is what this country will look like when we cross that bridge just 4 years from now into a new century and a new millennium. And all of you who are students here and probably everybody who is in this audience understands that we're going through a huge change in how we work and live, how we relate to each other and the rest of the world. And the real issue here is whether we're going to make a decision to do things together that will help each other have a chance to make the most of our own lives, live up to our God-given capacities, and build together stronger families and communities and States and nations or whether we're better off being told that we're on our own."", ""Now, all these issues have been debated to death, I guess, so let me just give you some personal examples out of my life. A couple of nights ago I was in Denver, Colorado, and we had a rally like this—it wasn't as big; it was at night and in a little—in an inside place— but I was going along the row like this, shaking hands. Here's what happened to me in about 5 minutes. In each case, I want you to listen and see if you identify with it."", 'I met a young woman who was a victim of domestic violence who thanked me for setting up the violence against women section at the Justice Department and working to stop violence against women and children and setting up that hotline.', 'I met a man who was doing ground-breaking research against Parkinson\'s disease who got a research grant because of an initiative of our administration. And he had fire in his eyes when he said, ""We are going to cure this disease; we\'re going to whip it; we\'re going to get to the point where we have 100 percent cure rate.""', 'And then I met a man who told me that he and his wife had just adopted a young child, and because of the family and medical leave law she was home with the child, getting the child accustomed to being in a new environment and they were not going to lose her job and her income because of it, because of the family and medical leave law.', ""And then I met three women who were breast cancer survivors who thanked me for fighting hard for the research funding in the budgets of the last 4 years that include more women and more research. We've uncovered two of the genes that cause breast cancer, and we may well be able not only to cure it but prevent it in the next few years."", 'And then—just walking down the line now— and then I met a young person who went back to school on the AmeriCorps program after serving in his community and then got some money to pay his way to college.', 'And then I met a young woman who was a police officer in a smaller Colorado town, thanking me for our police program that Wendell Ford voted for to put 100,000 more police on the streets of America because they were getting 5 more.', 'And then I met a young man who told me that he was a dropout and had given up on his life, but he heard me talking about the importance of going back to school. He found out about the changes that we\'ve made in the student loan program and what we were trying to do, and he said, ""I got one of those new loans and now I\'m going back to school and I\'m going to get a degree in microbiology. I didn\'t just get in, I got in in a big way,"" he said.', 'Now, that\'s just one ropeline. Every issue I talk to you about, every single one, my opponent and the leaders of the other party opposed us on the initiatives which made those things possible—every single one. That is what is at stake here. When I said we ought to pass a crime bill that puts 100,000 police on the street, they said, ""It won\'t do any good, and you\'ll never do it."" Then when they passed their budget, they must have been worried about us doing it because they tried to stop me from doing it. But we\'ve only funded about half those police officers. It\'s a 5-year program; you will decide whether we finish the job.', ""Now, here are the facts. The crime rate has gone down 4 years in a row. We have a 10year low in American crime. If we bring it down for 8 years in a row we might make our streets, our schools, our neighborhoods safe for all of America's children. I believe we're right and they're wrong. But you have to decide."", 'You have to decide so many of these issues. But if you strip them all away, you look at what is really at stake: What is it that we should be doing together to help each other make the most of our own lives? Now, we have had some time to see whether this approach works or not. Compared to 4 years ago, we have 10.7 million more jobs, record numbers of new small businesses, incomes are going up again, the lowest rates of unemployment and inflation in 27 years.', 'I met a woman—we were just in Cleveland, Hillary and I were—I met a woman who was crying and had a picture of her house because she had been able to buy a house because we have a 15-year high in homeownership, which is what happens if you drive the deficit down 63 percent and get those interest rates down.', ""So the country is moving in the right direction. And the real question before you is, what do you want it to look like 4 years from now? This is the last day of my last campaign. I will never seek office again unless I go home and run for the school board someday. [Laughter] This election is about your future. It's about what America will look like when your children are your age. And I tell you, we are on the verge of the greatest age of possibility in human history. The young people in this audience will have more chances to live out their dreams than any generation has ever had. There are many of you in this audience who before long will be doing jobs that have not been invented yet. Many of you will be doing jobs that have not even been imagined yet."", ""When I became President, there were 3 million people working in their homes. Today, there are 12 million. Four years from now there will be 40 million people. That's just one example. Things are changing so fast that we're building a supercomputer with IBM that will do more calculations in a second than you can do on your hand-held calculator in 30,000 years. Things are changing."", ""We have differences on the budget. We have differences on crime. We have differences on the environment. I believe we can preserve the environment and grow the economy, and I don't think we can grow the economy over the long run unless we do preserve the environment. It's an honest difference of opinion."", ""We have differences on issues like Medicare and Medicaid. The Medicaid program for 30 years has allowed families to maintain a middle class lifestyle, even if a member of their family was severely disabled, because people could work and still get some help for medical care for their loved ones. It's enabled people to go into nursing homes in their later years, and it has national standards of quality care. It's enabled poor children to get good care from the moment they're born. They wanted to take away that 30-year guarantee. I thought it was wrong. You can decide. I think that's one of the things we ought to do together."", ""But the most important issue before you is your education and the education of those who will come behind. Because in a world that is changing as it is, if you really want all the American people to have a chance to go into that future together, we've got to guarantee all our children world-class education. I want that to be the lasting legacy of this administration."", 'And I ask you to think of this. There are still 40 percent of the 8-year-olds in America who cannot read a book on their own. But I have a plan to mobilize one million volunteers to go out to the parents and the teachers of this country and help teach those kids to read. We got 200,000 more work-study slots out of this last budget for college students; I want 100,000 of them to go to young people who say, ""Send me. I will go. I will teach the children to read."" Will you help? Will you help us do that? [Applause]', 'You heard Wendell Ford talking about my dream that within 4 years every classroom and library and every school in America can be hooked up to the information superhighway. Think what it would mean if the children in the most remote Appalachian schools and the children in the biggest, poorest urban school districts were, together with the students in the richest, middle class, suburban, urban, rural school districts all over America—the first time ever, all these kids got access to the same information in the same way at the same time. That would revolutionize learning in America. It would explode the potential of our children. Will you help us do that? [Applause]', ""The last thing I want to say is, I am very proud that we've reformed the student loan program to make it less costly and to let people pay their loans back as a percentage of their incomes so no young person need fear going broke when you borrow money to go to college. I'm proud that 70,000 young people are in AmeriCorps, I'm proud that we got the biggest increase in Pell grants in 20 years, but we must do more. I want to open the doors of college to all Americans, and if you give me 4 more years, that's exactly what I intend to do."", 'Now, I want to make 2 years of college after high school as universal as a diploma in high school is today, and we can do that simply by saying, you can deduct from your tax bill, dollar for dollar, the cost of a typical community college tuition. I want to open the doors to all 4-year colleges and to graduate school by saying you can deduct from your tax bill up to $10,000 of tax deduction for the college tuition at any college and university in the United States today. Will you help us do that? Will you? [Applause]', ""Folks, let me say, in our politics today there is too little discussion of these issues and too much finger-pointing and insulting. In the end, when you're like me and you come to the end of more than 20 years of endeavor, I have to tell you something. I want to say this for our friends on the other side, too. Most of the people I've known in over 20 years of public life in both parties, people with different—who have disagreed with me, people who ran against me for office, most of the people I've known loved our country, worked hard, and were honest people. We just have honest differences of opinion."", 'Today, I still feel that way. But you must also understand the honest differences of opinion. And you are now the judges in that court of public opinion. These differences are being brought to you. Are we going to say, ""You\'re on your own,"" or are we going to build a bridge to the 21st century we can all walk across? Is our education program going to be abolishing the Department of Education or opening the doors of college to every single American who wants to go?', 'These are the decisions for you to make. This is a very great country. Its best days are still ahead. You can make sure that the 21st century is a time of unparalleled opportunity for all Americans, and you can do it only if you decide that we have to work together without regard to race, region, religion, or income. We\'ve got to work together. We\'ve got to be able to say to one another, ""If you are willing to show up tomorrow and say you believe in this country and its timeless values, you\'re ready to show up for work or school and do your part, we don\'t need to know anything else about you. You are part of our America, and we\'re going to build the greatest country the world has ever seen in the 21st century."" Will you help us do it?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Will you be there tomorrow?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. Will you elect Steve Beshear to the Senate?', 'Audience members. Yes!', 'The President. We need you.

Thank you all very much. Thank you.', ""I want to thank those people who are here, too numerous to name, who have been so important to me, to Hillary, to our administration and our efforts. I want to commend to you our candidates for Congress back here. I've gotten to know them. I was together with them in Indianola not very long ago. I believe that Leonard Boswell and Donna Smith and Bob Rush will do a good job for you, and I hope you will help them to win tomorrow as well."", 'You know, I have had two incredibly memorable experiences in Cedar Rapids, and they reflect a lot of what I have tried to do as President. Not very long ago I was here to dedicate the National Czech and Slovak Museum. And I brought with me, as you remember, the President of the Czech Republic and the President of Slovakia. And we had a wonderful day here— a little cold, but we had a great day. [Laughter] And we celebrated this mystery that is America, that we can meld together people from different ethnic groups and different religions and different races and different tribes and different views and still hold our country together and grow stronger.', ""And as we look around the world at the heartbreak of Bosnia; at the continuing heartbreak in Northern Ireland, where my people are still fighting over what happened 300 or 600 years ago; at the heartbreak of the Holy Land in the Middle East, the home of the world's three great monotheistic religions; as we look on our television news now at the heartbreak of these hundreds of thousands of refugees driven out of their refugee camps because people are still fighting tribal wars, even though no one has enough to get along on and if they'd work together it would be so much better—I thought to myself that cold day in Cedar Rapids, how fortunate we are that we live under a Constitution and a system where all of us are created equal, accorded equal status, and given the chance to live up to our God-given abilities. And I will always remember Cedar Rapids for that."", ""The other thing I remember is a rally I had here in 1992 at the Quaker Oats factory. I met a remarkable woman in that factory who had led the work of the people there in recycling paper and promoting a clean environment while growing the economy. I met a child with an unusual physical problem, abnormality from birth, who was otherwise a beautiful child. And it was before I became President. I looked at that child, and I saw how much that child's mother loved him. And I picked him and held him, and I said to myself, if I win this race for President, I will never rest until we have done everything we can in medical research to make as many people in America whole as possible. It is a part of our common obligation."", 'And then I remember seeing a woman, whom I later got to know quite well—she may be here tonight—a white woman holding an African-American baby. And it was interesting because we were being demonstrated against, kind of like you\'re being treated to at the last of this campaign. There were people holding signs on both sides of the abortion issue, and they were shouting at one another. And this woman was just standing there quietly in the crowd, holding this child of another race. And I said, ""Where did you get this baby?"" And she said, ""This is my baby. This baby was born HIVpositive, and no one would take this child in Florida, so I adopted this child. I\'m doing the very best I can."" She was already raising another couple of kids on her own. And she said, ""I don\'t mind those people having that debate back there, but if we\'re really going to be pro-life and pro-child, I wish they\'d all come along with me and adopt some of these kids. We need to build a better life.""', ""And not very long ago I had the honor of signing the minimum wage bill, which Senator Harkin talked about, which also did some wonderful things for small business—made it easier for small-business people to take out pensions on themselves and their employees and for the employees to take the pension from job to job, and made it easier for self-employed people to buy their own health insurance and gave them more tax relief for doing it. But that bill had another little-known provision which I'm particularly proud of. And on the day I signed that bill I thought of that woman holding that child, because that bill gives a $5,000 tax credit to Americans who will adopt children who need a home."", 'Now, I say that to make this point: To me that is what our public service is all about. To me that is what our public life is all about. And I think it is amazing that in so many elections in the 11th hour, with an avalanche of funds and emotions, people can be asked to suspend their convictions about issue after issue after issue after issue, based on a concerted attempt to convince the voters that somehow their opponent is some sort of an alien to their values.', ""And I wanted to be in Iowa on the last night of my last campaign in my entire life—I wanted to be in Iowa because, first of all, because it's a tight race and I want to carry the State— I mean, let's be honest—[laughter]—but also because this State is a place where I always feel at home, and I always have from the very first day I crossed the border and came here, and because I always felt that a people who had brought in enough crops and seen enough droughts and seen enough floods—you know, after that flood you all had before, you had everything but a plague of locusts visited on you there—[laughter]—that had seen all of life's ups and downs, all the rational and irrational things that can happen to you, and still were bound together and working together and producing the kind of schools Iowa is producing, producing the kind of economy Iowa was producing—I always felt that here you could talk sense to people and people could look at you in the eye and tell whether you were worth supporting and worth believing in. And I always love coming here."", 'And I want to say to you tonight, I would not presume to tell anyone in Iowa for whom to vote in any other race. I went home to Arkansas to campaign with some of my friends on Saturday, and there was a big article in the paper. It said, ""President\'s visit mixed blessing,"" and then it had every single time a President had come to Arkansas to try to get people to vote for somebody, and they had always voted for the other person. So I told the people, I said, ""This is no surprise to me. You didn\'t let me tell you who to vote for when I was just a Governor."" [Laughter]', ""So I wouldn't say that. But I want you to know three things I know about Tom Harkin and about Ruth and their family. And you make up your own mind about what you're going to do with that information between now and tomorrow, in terms of whether you could go home tonight and still call somebody and change a vote. You know, when you leave tonight, most people won't be in bed, even in Iowa. [Laughter] Most people are not going to be in bed. You could still do some good tonight, and I want you to think about it."", 'The first thing I want you to know is this, I spent a lot of time with Tom and Ruth Harkin when nobody else was looking, when there were no cameras around, no reporters around, no speech to give, no one to impress, no gain from anything. They are good people. They love their children, they love their country, and they love this State.', ""And I want to say, I understand—I don't normally get involved in local advertising campaigns, but I understand that Senator Harkin's opponent has actually run an ad against Ruth. They got that—you know, they started on Hillary, and now they're down to the Senate spouses. [Laughter] I wish they'd just pick on us. But anyway, saying that Ruth Harkin really wasn't qualified for the job I gave her; she only got it because she was Tom's wife. If you believe that, I've got some land way out in the ocean I'd like to sell you. [Laughter]"", ""Let me tell you something, folks, one thing I knew I had to do for you is to deliver on the economy. I knew that. And I made up my mind I was going to do some things that had never been done before. I was not going to appoint just someone who was a politician who had supported me at the Department of Commerce, I was going to appoint somebody I though would be good. I was not going to appoint someone that I thought would be a good political appointment but someone who could really produce in the trade office. I was going to appoint somebody who was not just a political appointment but someone who had actually created small businesses at the Small Business Administration. And at Ruth Harkin's job, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, I was going to appoint somebody I thought could help create jobs in America by getting opportunities for us overseas."", ""Now, I know what that ad says, but let me tell you, like so many of their ads against us, they have a huge problem with something called the evidence—the evidence—the evidence. [Laughter] She, Ruth Harkin, in spite of the fact that she's married to Tom, has the finest record of achievement of any person who has ever held that position in the Federal Government of the United States of America. And there are more Americans working, more businesses profiting and our economy is stronger because I appointed her. And I'm glad I did, and I'd do it again tomorrow."", ""Now, I'll tell you something else. I'm for Tom Harkin because he'll fight. I know; I've been on the other side of a fight with him, you know, once before. [Laughter] He'll fight. And if he's for you and he believes it's right and he thinks that Iowa needs something, if he has to stand all by himself in a whirlwind, he will stand right there until he is blown away. He will not walk away from you and from our country."", 'The other night we were on the campaign plane, you know, and you practically get silly, you\'re so tired, on these campaign planes. You can just imagine how it is, you know, how exhausted you get. And your conversation wanders off into all kinds of things; it\'s amazing. And this was before we scheduled to come here tonight. And we were having a talk about politicians and people in public office and who they were and how they were and everything. And somebody looked at me and said, ""If you were in a desperate situation with enemies closing in on all sides and you were all by yourself and you had to pick one person who would stand there and fight with you to the very end, who would you pick?"" And I did not miss a breath; I said, ""Tom Harkin of Iowa. Tom Harkin of Iowa.""', ""You need to think a long time in Iowa before you trade in a man that gave you the Americans with Disabilities Act, a man that has fought for medical research, a man that has fought for education, a man that has fought for farmers, a man that has fought for this country. You need to think a long time before you trade in someone like that for a person who marched to the beat of the Speaker Gingrich's army in 1995 and threatened to send this country back after all the progress we've made."", ""The second thing I want to say is, Tom Harkin fought for us when it counted. When the Republicans won the Congress in 1994 with their contract on America—how many times has Mr. Lightfoot talked about the contract on America in this campaign? How many times have they told you what a wonderful thing it was and how they pushed it? How many times have they bragged on cutting Head Start and cutting college loans and paralyzing our ability to implement environmental protection? How many times have they bragged on stripping a 30-year guarantee of quality medical care through the Medicaid programs to middle class families who have family members with disabilities, to elderly people in nursing homes, to getting rid of the quality standards—even the standards—of guaranteed quality in our nursing homes, to taking the quality of care, the guarantee of care away from newborn babies just because they're poor? Have they talked about that very much in this campaign?"", 'Audience members. No-o-o!', ""The President. I'm telling you, I see it all over America. They're praying for amnesia on your part. [Laughter]"", ""Vice President Gore—who incidentally is jealous that he's not here tonight and I am—he told a story today in Cleveland that we used to tell each other in Arkansas and I'd forgotten. But it's a good story, and you'll appreciate it in Iowa."", 'He said there was a politician out on the country road running for office, and he came upon a farmer who was sitting up on his porch. There was an old dog laying out there in the yard. He said, ""Sir, I\'d like to come ask you for your vote. Will your dog bite?"" He said, ""No."" So the guy hiked over the fence, went up, shook hands with the farmer. And just as he was asking for the vote, the dog got up and ran up and bit him right in the rear. So he ran back and got in his car and rolled the window down and said, ""I thought you said your dog wouldn\'t bite."" He said, ""That ain\'t my dog, son."" [Laughter]', ""Now, that's what they want you to think about that budget that I vetoed. But it is their dog. It is their dog. And I thought it was a mangy old dog, and that's why I vetoed it, because I did not want to see our country divided."", 'And then they shut the Government down; not once but twice they shut it down and said, ""You will take these $270 billion in Medicare cuts and our attempt to split Medicare apart."" You know, we have—American senior citizens have the lowest poverty rate ever recorded in history now and the highest life expectancy of any group of seniors in the world in part because of Medicare. We have to reform it, but I\'m not going to wreck it. That\'s a high class problem, having people living longer and well. I\'m proud of that achievement. Every American should be proud of it.', 'And they said, ""We\'re going to make you take it, or we\'ll shut the Government down."" And I looked around and I counted how many people were going to be on that field with me, because the President\'s veto is no good unless somebody will stand with him. And Tom Harkin was first in line. And what we told them was, ""Go on and shut the Government down. We\'d rather see the American people hurt for 30 days than 30 years, and we will not go along. We will not go along. We will not go along.""', 'But the third thing I want to say to you is, notwithstanding their attempts to sort of distract and divert the American people and divide us here, this country is in better shape than it was 4 years ago, and we need to keep going until we build that bridge to the 21st century. This is a happy time. This is a great time for America.', 'Of all the countries in the world, we\'ve had the best growth for the last 4 years. We have the lowest deficit. If you take the big seven economies, we have created by far more jobs in America than all the other countries put together, 10.7 million more than we had 4 years ago. We\'re moving in the right direction. We need to bear down and go on. Farm exports at an all-time high; we\'ve opened new markets for all kinds of things. And I\'m telling you, we are moving in the right direction. And the most important thing is when you vote for President tomorrow, when you vote for Senator tomorrow, when you vote for Congress tomorrow, you have to ask yourself, ""We\'re going into this new century; things are changing. What do I want my country to look like, and what do those guys or those women have to do about it?""', ""Now for years, since I have been your President, I take a little time every day to ask and answer this question, what do I want my country to look like when we enter the 21st century? What do I want my country to look like when our daughter is our age? And for me it's pretty simple. I want the American dream to be alive and well for everybody responsible enough to work for it. I want America to lead the world indefinitely for peace and freedom and prosperity. And I want us to beat the odds when the rest of this old world is being torn apart by their differences; I want us to relish and respect our diversity and say, we share the same values and we're going forward together. That's what I want America to look like."", ""Now, your vote will determine whether that happens in Iowa. Your vote will determine whether we keep on going and balance the budget with a targeted tax cut we can afford for education and childrearing and buying a first-time home and dealing with medical costs and not charging people taxes when they sell their home. We can pay for that one and still protect Medicare and Medicaid, invest in education and the environment and technology and the future of these young people; or their plan, which is a big old scheme, sounds great at election time: a bigger deficit, higher interest rates, bigger cuts than the ones I vetoed when they shut the Government down. And they're still trying to raise taxes, as Tom said, on those 8 million working families making modest incomes. Your vote will decide."", 'I think you know which vote will build a bridge to the 21st century. Will you seize the opportunity tomorrow to help us do it? Your vote will decide. Your vote will decide——', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. Thank you. Let me ask you this. You heard Tom Harkin talking about the crime bill. One of the most troubling things in America has been the high rates of violence among our people, especially among our young people. Now we have 4 years of declining crime, a 10-year low in the crime rate. We're halfway through implementing that crime bill Tom Harkin voted for in 1994 to put 100,000 police on the street. They were against it. Then they killed it in the budget I vetoed. Then they tried to stop it all over again. Now, why in the wide world they would oppose something that we are doing together that is working is beyond me. But they are."", ""So if you want to finish the job and you want 8 years of declining crime and you want our children to be able to grow up on streets and in neighborhoods and be in schools that are truly safe, you've got to help us by helping us to build a bridge with Tom Harkin, with these candidates for Congress, with Bill Clinton and Al Gore for safer streets and a brighter tomorrow."", 'If you want——', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. Let me say, Tom Harkin talked a little about health care, and so did Hillary. I'd like to brag on them both, but you'd be here till dawn if I did that. We have made a beginning on health care reform, but here is another choice. I want you to think about it."", ""Their budget will do nothing to advance the cause of health reform. Our budget—balanced budget—adds another million children to the ranks of those with health insurance, children of lower income working people, gives free mammograms to Medicare women, free mammograms. Our budget says to people who are between jobs, if you lose your job and your income, we'll help your family keep health insurance for 6 months. Our budget says we'll help families with respite care, the nearly 2 million American families that are courageously caring for family members with Alzheimer's. And our budget says, we're going to spend another billion dollars on medical research over and above what they will, because we have uncovered two genes that cause breast cancer. We have determined a cure—a treatment for the first time for strokes. We have seen for the first time movement in the lower limbs of laboratory animals whose spines have been completely severed because of nerve transplants from the legs to the spine."", 'We are moving to break down the barriers of knowledge, and we are going to keep going until we have reformed the health care system in a way that makes it work for all Americans. And your vote will decide. Your vote will decide.', ""Your vote will decide. Your vote will decide, most important of all in shaping the 21st century, what we do about education. We know what their program is. Their program is fewer Head Start positions, cut student loans, and eliminate the Department of Education. That's their big deal, eliminate the Department of Education. They say it's a big bureaucracy. Two percent is bureaucracy; 98 cents is money we're pumping to your schools, your colleges, and your students. I say we don't want to eliminate the Department of Education."", ""I want to do three things. I want to make sure, first of all, that every 8-year-old in this country can read a book independently by the third grade; 40 percent can't now. We're going to mobilize an army of a million people to go out and work with teachers and parents to do that. A hundred thousand of them will be college students who are going to get new workstudy slots because of the work that Tom Harkin and this administration did in the Congress this year."", 'I want every classroom in Iowa and every classroom in America to be hooked up not only with computers but computers that are linked through the Internet, through the World Wide Web, through the information superhighway. What it means is that people in the smallest school in Iowa, people in the most remote school district in Alaska, people in the poorest inner-city school district for the first time in history will have access along with all other wealthy, middle class, and poor districts, urban, suburban, and rural districts, all of them together for the first time in the history of America will have access to the same learning in the same way at the same time. Will you help us do that? Will you go out for Tom Harkin tomorrow to do that? Will you help us? [Applause]', 'And finally, let me say to all these young people here, one thing we know is that education will no longer be the province of people who are 18 and under. We know now that nearly everybody needs to go much further. We know now that most people will have to learn for a lifetime. We know now that the young people in this audience today, many of them within a few years will be doing jobs that have not been invented yet, and some of you will be doing jobs that have not been imagined yet. And therefore, we must open the doors of college education to every single citizen of this country who is willing to work for it. It is time.', ""Let me say to all of you, I am proud that we kept our commitment in 1992 to set up a national service program, AmeriCorps, that has allowed 70,000 young people to serve their communities and go to college. I am proud that we had the biggest increase in Pell grants in 20 years. And I am proud that we have increased work-study grants by 200,000 and that we reformed the student loan program so people can now borrow money at lower cost and pay it back as a percentage of their income, so no one ever need fear going broke by borrowing the money to go to college. I'm proud of that, but we must do more. We must do more."", ""And if you give us a chance to serve tomorrow, we're going to do two things. Number one, we're going to say people ought to be able to take off their tax bill, dollar for dollar, the cost of a typical community college tuition so we can make 2 years of education after high school as universal as a high school diploma is today by the year 2000. Number two, more Iowa families ought to be able to save in an individual retirement account and withdraw from it without any penalty if they're using the money for a college education or health care or homebuying. And thirdly, everybody ought to be able to have a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year for the cost of college tuition, undergraduate or graduate. Will you help us do that tomorrow? Will you help make that part of our bridge? [Applause] I can't hear you. Will you do it? [Applause]"", 'Now, let me say I am very grateful to you for the votes that you gave to me and to Al Gore 4 years ago. I know how hotly contested this State has been. I know that the State is more or less evenly divided and that there are a lot of people who are independents who will vote either way. But I say to you, this is not an election for party; this is an election for country and for people. Remember the stories of the people from Iowa I told you at the beginning of my remarks. Every day for 4 years, I have gotten up and gone into that Oval Office and tried to do something that would help to create more opportunity, to insist upon more responsibility, and to bring us closer together in an American community.', 'We are better off than we were 4 years ago. We have a better plan for the future. Our best days are still ahead. And the fundamental choice that underlies all these issue differences is as crystal clear as can be. We believe that we\'re better off when we work together to help each other make the most of our own lives. They believe you\'re on your own. They believe it\'s okay to say, ""There\'s a future out there. It will be pretty exciting if you get there, and I hope you do."" I believe every single one of us are better off if we roll up our sleeves and join hands and build that bridge to the 21st century together. We need you tomorrow. Go call someone! Go ask someone to vote! Go do your work tonight; we\'ll see you tomorrow!', 'Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America.']"
144,William J. Clinton ,"November 04, 1996","[""Thank you very much. Thank you. Well, I didn't expect to see so many of you here this late at night. Senator and Mrs. Daschle; Senatorto-be and Mrs. Johnson; Congressman-to-be and Mrs. Weiland. And I want us to give a real good hand here to Rick Weiland and his fine wife. They've done a great job out there campaigning, give them a hand. [Applause] Pam Nelson, thank you for your candidacy. Give Pam Nelson a hand. Stand up, Pam. She needs your help tomorrow. [Applause] I want to thank CeCe Peniston for singing so beautifully; the Bill Gibson Orchestra. Thank you, South Dakota State University Marching Band. You were fabulous."", ""Now, you know, if the rest of us can maintain that level of energy till the polls close tomorrow night, we're going to be just fine, and this is great. We're going to be fine. Thank you."", ""And I want to thank my longtime friend who was with me 4 years ago on this night under similar circumstances. He's going to bring us good luck again, Jerry Jeff Walker and his band. Thank you for being here. God bless you, friend."", ""You know, folks, I appreciate what Tom Daschle said in thanking us for our lavish attention to South Dakota and all that. It's not complicated. I like it here. I like coming here. I enjoy being here. I feel at home here. I feel this is a place where people still know their neighbors and where they care about what happens to their neighbors and where they understand, in the best sense, as Hillary often says, it does take a village for us to raise our children and build our future."", 'This is the last election of the 20th century for President, the first election of the 21st century, an election occurring against a background of almost breathtaking, unimaginable changes in technology and science, in the way we are simply organized to work and live and relate to each other and the rest of the world. The young people here in this audience today, in a few years many will be doing jobs that have not been invented yet. Many will be doing jobs that have not been imagined yet.', 'One little piece of evidence about how much the world is changing: When I became President there were 3 million Americans who were living and working in their homes, making a living. That was 4 years ago. Today, there are 12 million Americans doing that because of technology, and 4 years from now there will be 30 million Americans doing that.', 'We just signed a contract, the United States did, with IBM to develop a supercomputer that will do more calculations in one second than you can do at home tonight on your hand-held calculator in 30,000 years. That is an example of what is happening.', 'I say that to make this point: This is an election of enormous consequence, not because of Tim Johnson or Bill Clinton but because of the sweeping changes going on in our country. And the great question is, how shall we respond to those changes?', ""There's been a lot of back and forth in this campaign that I think is, unfortunately, a byproduct of much of modern politics, a lot of negative stuff. My experience has been that most people in public life in both parties are good, honest, hard-working people who give their lives to their country and love their country. In this case we just have different views. And you should be happy about that because in an election of great consequence there ought to be a clear choice and you ought to have some way of measuring whether the choice you're making is right. And I would argue to the people of South Dakota—I know that there are more registered Republicans than Democrats here; I know there are a lot of registered independents here. This vote tomorrow should be the first vote of the 21st century. It ought to be a vote about people and progress and hopes and dreams. Party is not nearly as important tomorrow as reaching out for our dreams and our deepest hopes for our children, and that is what I am asking."", ""Now, you know, maybe some of you have noticed this, but I am now speaking at the last rally of the last campaign I will ever run. And I'm honored to share it with you. It's hard for me to believe that this January it will be 23 years ago when, as a young 27-year-old man, I asked the people of my rural hill country congressional district in Arkansas to send me to Congress. They said no, by the way. [Laughter]"", ""And everybody thought I was washed up. Then I got to be my State's attorney general and Governor, and then in the Reagan landslide of 1980 they said no again. [Laughter] By the time I was 34 years old, I had already been defeated twice. I was in Ripley's already. I was the youngest ex-Governor in the history of America. [Laughter] But the people of my home State were good to me. We learned a lot together, and we did a lot together. And 4 years ago you gave me the chance to be President."", ""The American people 4 years ago took us on faith when I said that I hated what had happened in politics in Washington; it was too much hot air, too many insults, not enough issues, not enough results, not enough people reaching across the partisan divide and working together in a new and different time to try and build a new politics for America. I said that if you elected me, I would follow a vigorous and disciplined approach: more opportunity for everybody, more responsibility from everybody, and an American community in which everyone who works hard and is responsible has a place at the table and a role to play. We have done that for 4 years, and you don't have to guess anymore."", ""Our friends on the other side, they honestly believe that we're better off when we're on our own. I think we're better off when we work together to give each other not a guarantee but a chance to make the most of our own lives and our families and our future. And you don't have to guess anymore."", ""This economy is stronger than it was 4 years ago. The deficit has gone down by 63 percent and there are 10.7 million more jobs and the lowest rates of unemployment and inflation in 27 years. Something that's always been important to hard working families in this part of our country is that everybody who works hard ought to have a fair share. We've had the biggest decline in inequality of incomes among working people in 27 years, the biggest drop in child poverty in 30 years, the lowest rate of poverty among seniors in America ever recorded since we've been keeping statistics. We are moving in the right direction to the 21st century. We are."", ""And in our country as a whole the crime rate has gone down to a 10-year low. The welfare rolls have dropped by nearly 2 million. Child support collections, by the way, are up by about 50 percent. And more children are getting what they are entitled to. Our economy is in better shape than it was 4 years ago, but so is our environment. We've taken millions of tons of pollutants out of the atmosphere, raised the standards for safe drinking water and the purity of food. And I might add, we've done that with the support of the agricultural community. We've cleaned up more toxic waste dumps in 3 years than our opponents did in 12."", 'So we\'re moving in the right direction. And you have this clear choice. They say all these terrible things they say about all of us, you know, but it obscures the fact that we\'re moving in the right direction, that we have now 4 years of evidence that ""you\'re on your own"" is not nearly as good as ""we\'re working together to build a bridge to the 21st century we can all walk across."" And that\'s what this is about.', ""Now, there is another very important piece of evidence here, and that is when our friends in the other party were in power and were given the power to enact their Contract With America—by the way, how many times has Congressman Johnson's opponent mentioned that contract in this election? But anyway, they did it, and it wasn't just the House under Newt Gingrich. It was the Senate under Senator Dole. They did it together. And they passed their version of what they thought America's future ought to be. They did it all by themselves. They told us they didn't want our help, they didn't want our votes, and they weren't interested in our input. They wanted to do it, and they wanted to show America what they wanted to do."", ""And we saw. We saw. They passed a budget which cut 3 times as much from Medicare as was necessary to save the Trust Fund and divided the program so that the oldest, the poorest, and the most ill of our seniors ran the risk of being put in a second-class program at a time when it wasn't necessary and at a time when we know it's wrong. We've got the lowest poverty rate we ever had among seniors. And in America, if you live to be 65, you have the highest life expectancy of any group of seniors in the world. That's a high-class problem. Why would they mess that up? That's what they tried to do."", ""They also took the Medicaid program, which has for 30 years provided a guarantee of health care to poor women and infant children, to middle class families with family members with disabilities so they could take care of their family members and still work and maintain their middle class lifestyle, to a lot of our seniors in nursing homes and standards for those nursing homes and they got rid of all that. And they cut education funding from Head Start to college loans for the first time in modern history, abolished the Department of Education, abolished the program to put 100,000 police on our street, which has played a critical role in bringing the crime rate down, and paralyzed environmental enforcement and cut it back by 25 to 30 percent. That's what they did. They also— oh, by the way—raised taxes on 9 million of our hardest pressed working families and gave companies the authority to raid their workers' pension funds. We went through that in the 1980's. In 1994, Tom Daschle and Tim Johnson and I passed a worker protection pension act to protect the pensions of 40 million retired and still working people, and they wanted to turn around and undo that. That's what they did."", 'Now, along toward the end of this last Congress they adopted our program. They said, ""Oh, we\'ve got to go face the voters. We\'ll give the President what he wants."" And they hope you have this case of collective amnesia. [Laughter] The Vice President told a story today in Cleveland when we were together—I had forgotten this story; we used to tell it at home all the time—but it captures what they\'re trying to get you to think about their budget.', 'It\'s a story about a politician who\'s out in the country, and he sees a farmer. He\'s running for office, and the farmer is sitting up on his porch rocking, and he says, ""I\'m going to go talk to this farmer,"" but there\'s a big old dog in the yard that\'s ferocious looking. So he says, ""Sir, I\'d like to come visit with you, but does your dog bite?"" He said, ""No."" So he hikes over the fence, goes over on the porch, shakes hands with the farmer and tells him he\'s running for the legislature and would like to have his vote. And the dog runs up and bites him right in the rear. [Laughter] And he runs back and jumps in his car and rolls the window down and said, ""I thought you said your dog didn\'t bite."" He said, ""Son, that ain\'t my dog."" [Laughter]', ""And let me tell you something, folks, that budget that I vetoed, it is their dog, and it was a mangy old dog, and that's why I vetoed that dog. And everybody—and I'll tell you, if you reward them, everybody—oh, I can see it all now in the columns the next day—well, that budget wasn't so unpopular after all. You have to decide."", 'They said, ""Well, the Democrats—Tom Daschle, Tim Johnson, people like that—they love the Government so much they\'ll never let us shut it down, and we\'ll just make the President cave. We\'ll put them all on their knees. If they don\'t take our budget and let us shove it to the American people, we\'ll just shut the Government down, and we\'ll show them who\'s boss.""', 'And they did it, and we didn\'t cave. And they did it again, and we didn\'t cave. And what I finally told them was, I said, ""Look, I hate to see the American people inconvenienced for 30 or 40 days, but that is nothing to seeing the American people hurt, divided, and set back for 30 or 40 years. Shut her down. We are not going to cave."" Thank you, Tim Johnson, for staying there. Thank you.', ""Now, let me give you an idea of what the practical impact of that was on you. I was in Denver the other night and we had a nice little indoor rally like this—I think you got more folks here tonight. But they were really great, though. We had a great rally, and after the rally I did what I always do: I started at one end, went to the other end, just shook hands with everybody I could reach. And while I was moving in a space about like this, I met the following people: I met a young woman who started crying who thanked me for the work we were doing in trying to combat domestic violence and violence against women. She was obviously a victim. That was in the crime bill that they opposed. So if they had had their way, it wouldn't be law."", ""Then I met a young woman in a police uniform from a smaller community in Colorado thanking me for the five new police officers that her community had, and she was going to feel safer on the street and the kids were going to be safer in her community. That was in the crime bill, and that was in the budget that they tried to do away with. All those police officers, they wouldn't have been there."", 'Then I met a young man who had dropped out of college and went back when we changed the college loan program so you could borrow a lot of money and then pay it back as a percentage of your income so young people would never be bankrupted by borrowing the money to go to college. They did away with that, too. They tried to kill it, and they did away with that.', 'Then I met a man who told me that he and his wife had just adopted a 2-month-old baby, and his wife was able to go home and make that child more comfortable in their new circumstances without losing her job because of the family and medical leave law. And they led the fight against that. This happens to me all the time.', ""Then I met a young woman who was going to college because she'd worked in AmeriCorps, the national service program, serving her community, and earned the money to go to college. Seventy thousand young people have done that. They are solving problems and helping people all across America, and they did away with that in the budget."", ""Now, those are just people that I just ran into in a line just like this in South Dakota. This has huge consequences for America. Now, I know that in Congressman Johnson's race there's a lot of talk about clout. And that's an interesting concept, clout. [Laughter] It looks to me like you'd have a lot of clout if Tom Daschle were the majority leader of the Senate. You would have a lot of clout because everybody in the entire United States Congress, in both parties, who knows him respects Tim Johnson as one of the most hard-working, effective, intelligent, persistent Members of Congress in the entire country."", 'And you\'d have a lot of clout because the President likes Congressman Johnson and listens to him. And when he says, ""Mr. President, you\'re wrong; you shouldn\'t do this. This, this is what\'s in the best interest of the people of South Dakota,"" I would be highly likely to listen to Tim Johnson if he said this.', 'So it makes a difference. You know, the title is not enough. There\'s a difference. You have to draw these distinctions. It reminds me of my other favorite dog story. [Laughter] You know about—this guy is going down the highway, and he sees this sign that says, ""George Jones, Veterinarian/Taxidermist. Either way you get your dog back."" [Laughter]', ""It makes a difference. Tim Johnson will have good clout. He'll be very, very good, and he won't be using a committee chairmanship to saddle the American people or the people of South Dakota with the kind of budget that I had to veto that would have divided this country and set us back. He'll be building a bridge to the future."", ""So you ought to go to the polls tomorrow happy and upbeat and feeling good about your country. You ought to go to the polls tomorrow with absolutely no doubt in your mind that the best days of America lie ahead. But you should be heavily aware of the responsibility you and all Americans bear to seize this opportunity to say, if we're going to meet the challenges we face, if we're going to seize the opportunities we have, we have to do this together. There are some things we must do together. I talked about that supercomputer. The richest person in this audience tonight cannot afford to build that."", ""Every American who won a Nobel Prize this year in physics and chemistry started with a public research grant. The Internet, which is going to be the salvation of so many people in rural areas, allowing them access to things they would never have otherwise, started as a Government research project. It's now in the private sector where it belongs, but I just announced another investment of $100 million to modernize and expand it because when we all get on we don't want it to break down. We want it to take us out to the rest of the world."", ""Now, we have to do some things together. So your vote is going to decide whether we go on and balance this budget, have a targeted tax cut for education, childrearing, health care, and homebuying that we can afford in a balanced budget, protect Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment; or whether we go back and replay what happened before with their big, risky tax scheme that still raises taxes on the hardest pressed working people, will require bigger cuts in those things than the ones I vetoed, will blow a hole in the deficit, and violates every fiscal principle that I know that the people of South Dakota, Republican, Democrat, or independent, all believe in. You have to decide. Let's go on and balance the budget and build that bridge to the 21st century. You will have to decide. You have to decide."", ""You have to decide whether we're going to finish the work of the crime bill and put a whole 100,000 police on the street; whether we're going to continue to support the safe and drug-free schools program which we have doubled so that more people will be out there telling these young people drugs are wrong, illegal, they can kill you. This is not the time to turn back on that problem. There's still too many kids out there raising themselves. They need a strong hand and guidance, and I want to give it to them. We dare not cut back on that program and walk away from it. You have to decide."", ""I say let's keep bringing the crime rate down. In 4 more years we might actually feel safe in this country again if we can do it. You have to decide."", 'You have to decide whether you really believe, not just something to cheer about on the eve of an election but whether deep inside you believe that America will never be what it ought to be until we give all of our children and all of our adults now access to world-class educational opportunities with high standards, accountability, technology, and all the benefits that the best schools have. You have to decide.', 'Let me just give you an example. I want to do three things. Number one, you know 40 percent of the 8-year-olds in this country still can\'t read a book on their own. A lot of them come from places where their first language is not English. That will be cold comfort to them when they can\'t learn later on because they didn\'t learn to read when they were young. We have a plan to mobilize a million volunteers. We have 100,000 more work-study slots that we\'ll make available to college students if they\'ll teach 8year-olds to read. I want to go into the schools and work with the parents so that by the year 2000 every 8-year-old in this country can pick up a book and say, ""I can read this all by myself."" Will you help me do that? Will you help us do that? [Applause]', ""The second thing I want to do—we had an event about this in South Dakota not very long ago. I think the Vice President was here. We are working hard to connect every classroom and every library in every school in America to the information superhighway by the year 2000. And here's what it means. It means that children in every American tribe in America, children in the poorest rural school districts, children in the most remote districts in Alaska, children in the biggest—poor inner-city school districts in our biggest cities; children in urban, suburban, and rural districts; rich, poor, middle class—for the first time in the history of America, because of these connections we can make available the same learning from all over the world at the same level of quality in the same time to all of our children. It will revolutionize education. Will you help us build that bridge to the 21st century? [Applause]"", 'And finally, when you look at these college students, let me say that we must—we must— open the doors of college to all Americans. And we can do this, number one, by making 2 years of college as universal as a high school diploma is today. In 4 years we can do it by simply saying you can deduct from your tax bill, dollar for dollar, the cost of the typical community college tuition. All you have to do is go and make your grades and do your business.', 'Number two, I want to make it possible for more people to save in an individual retirement account, but withdraw from it tax-free if the money is used for education or homebuying or health care.', 'And finally, something that would help virtually every person in that band up there. I think the people ought to be able to deduct up to $10,000 per year for the cost of tuition at any college or university in any place in the United States. Now, will you help us do that? [Applause]', ""But again, I say, all these issues, all these divisions, they're not a matter of party. Every time we go through a period of big change, we are given an opportunity not only to increase our prosperity, not only to make our lives more interesting but to build stronger families and stronger communities and to live closer to our values. That is what this election is about."", 'This is the last speech of my last campaign. If you came up to me and said, ""What have you learned in 23 years that never changes?"" I would say, when people look into their hearts and they ask, ""What is the right thing for my children and for my family and for America\'s future,"" when they set aside their prejudices and embrace people of different racial and religious and ethnic groups who share their values of work and family and belief in the Constitution, when they roll up their sleeves and work together, America always wins.', ""This is the greatest country in human history because we have created a system in which you are the boss. Tomorrow you will be the boss, and you will go in there, and you will be asked, will we renew President Clinton's contract? You will be asked—you're going to be asked, should we hire Tim Johnson to be our Senator? Should we hire Rick Weiland to be our Congressman? Should we hire Pam Nelson to be our corporation commissioner? You're going to be asked these questions. But the real question is, are we going to do it together? That's what I've learned. I have learned that when we are divided, when we look down on each other, when we look for what these politicians call wedge issues to divide each other, to win a campaign because we get people in a lather so there's more heat than light in our debates and discussions, we always get hurt."", ""But when we join hands and run our country the way you try to run your families, your churches, your farms, your factories, your businesses, your communities, your charities, when we do that, we always win. There is no person living in this country today who knows that better than I do. There is no person living in this country today who has been given more gifts, who feels more humble on this night than I do. Fifty years ago, when I was born in a summer storm to a widowed mother in a little town in Arkansas, it was unthinkable that I might have ever become President. I'd like for you to believe I did it because I always worked 60 or 70 hours a week, I had an understanding and supportive and wonderful family, and I just did it. But it isn't true. I did it because at every step along the way for 23 years and long before, there was a Sunday school teacher, a teacher in school, a doctor, the guy running the Red Roof in my hometown who always stopped and talked to me and tried to give me encouragement when I was despondent, over and over and over. We just need to run our country the way we want to run our lives. That is what I have learned in 23 years, and that is what I ask you to vote for tomorrow as we build our bridge to the 21st century."", 'Thank you, God bless you, and good night. Thank you.']"
145,William J. Clinton ,"November 05, 1996","[""My fellow Americans, thank you for being here. Just 4 years from now we will enter a new century of great challenge and unlimited possibility. Now, we've got a bridge to build, and I'm ready if you are."", ""Today the American people have spoken. They have affirmed our course. They have told us to go forward. America has told every one of us, Democrats, Republicans, and independents, loud and clear: It is time to put politics aside, join together, and get the job done for America's future. In the last 4 years we've made remarkable progress, but in our schools, our families, our workplaces, and our communities, our journey is not done. My fellow Americans, we have work to do, and that's what this election was all about."", 'I want to say to all of you here and to all of the American people, no words can convey the gratitude I feel tonight for the honor that has been given to me. It is an honor that belongs to many: first to my family, to my wonderful wife of 21 years, who from the day I first met her began teaching me that it does take a village to raise our children and build our future; to our daughter, Chelsea, for understanding the work we have done together, the burdens it has imposed. Today I went down to the train station to vote in the last election in which I will appear on the ballot. And as I have done in every year since she was born, I took Chelsea to the ballot with me. And as we looked at the ballot together and discussed the issues there, I thanked God that I was born an American.', 'I thank the members of my wonderful family who are here, my stepfather Dick Kelley, my wonderful mother-in-law, Dorothy Rodham, and all the others. And I thank my beloved mother who is smiling up there and said, ""I never had a doubt, I always knew it would be this way.""', ""I thank the friends of my lifetime. There are people who have stood with me through thick and thin, who started with me in grade school, in junior and senior high school, in college, and all across the years since, friends who knew me and knew my dreams and stood as a powerful force against those who sought to stop America's progress with the politics of personal destruction. Thank you, my friends. Thank you for what you did for America."", ""I thank the people of my beloved native State. I would not be anywhere else in the world tonight. In front of this wonderful old capitol that has seen so much of my own life and our State's history, I thank you for staying with me so long, for never giving up, for always knowing that we could do better."", ""I thank the finest Vice President this country has ever seen. Because of Al Gore, we have a stronger and more secure relationship with a democratic Russia; we are exploring the wonders of new technologies for the benefit of America; we are protecting our environment; and we have reinvented America's Government so that it does more with less, thanks to his leadership. It is a legacy unique in the history of this Republic."", 'I thank Tipper for her friendship, for her crusades on behalf of our children and the mental health of the American people, and for always standing with us, along with her children and her family.', 'I thank the members of our administration, the Cabinet members, the members of the White House staff. I thank all those who are part of the permanent service to the President at the White House, the medical staff. I thank especially my Secret Service detail that has been so challenged by a President determined not to be isolated from the American people.', 'I thank the members of our campaign staff, all those who have served in this election and the work you have done. I thank the leaders of our party in the Congress, in the statehouses. I thank all those who stood for what we believe in in these elections today, those who won and those who did not. You did a service to America by raising the things in which we believe. And I thank you all and wish you Godspeed.', ""I want to thank the employees of the Nation's Government. They have had to do a remarkable job. We have reduced the size of our Government to its smallest point since President Kennedy served, and yet they have continued to serve the people better year-in and year-out. They had to do it in the face of enormous challenges and outright hatred for momentary periods. They have had to live with the horror of Oklahoma City and the difficulties that came along the way. But the people who serve us deserve our thanks, and I thank them."", ""I thank those who served this administration and our cause who are no longer here tonight. And one especially I must thank, my friend and brother Ron Brown. You're looking down on us, and I know you're smiling, too."", 'On a purely personal note, I must thank my pastor, Rex Horne, who prayed with me before I came out here tonight, and all the ministers and people of God who prayed for me and with me over these last 4 years. There were a few especially, and they know who they are, who came to the White House time after time, in good times and bad. When the times were bad, they reminded me that God gave Saint Paul a thorn in his flesh so he would not become exalted in his own eyes. And that certainly was not a problem for me in the bad times. [Laughter] When the times were good, they reminded me that humility is always in order in the Presidency, for in this life we see through a glass darkly, and we cannot know the whole truth of our circumstances or the motives of those who oppose us. I thank them all for bringing me closer to God and to the eternal wisdom without which a President cannot serve.', 'I would like to say a special word of thanks to Senator Dole, and I ask you to join me in applause for his lifetime of service to the United States. [Applause]', 'And I thank Jack Kemp for his service to America and his devotion to the proposition that this is a country in which everyone should have a chance to live free and equal and to have a chance at success.', 'Let me say, I had a good visit with Senator Dole not too long before he went out to speak. I thanked him for his love of our country, for his years of service. I applauded the campaign that he fought so bravely to the very last minute. I thanked him for the work we did together to advance the common cause of America. And on behalf of all Americans, I wish him well and Godspeed.', ""Four years ago, on these very steps, we set forth on a journey to change the course of America for the better, to keep the American dream alive for everyone willing to work for it, to keep America the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity, to come together as one American community. The time was one of widespread frustration and doubt about our economic and social problems, about our ability to deal with the vast sweep of change that was all around us. The scope and pace of those changes were threatening to many, and our values seemed to be under attack on all sides. But together, you and I vowed to turn our country around, with a strategy to meet our challenges and protect our values: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, an American community of all Americans."", ""We have worked hard to end the politics of who's to blame and instead to ask, what are we going to do to make America better? Tonight we proclaim that the vital American center is alive and well. It is the common ground on which we have made our progress. Today our economy is stronger, our streets are safer, our environment is cleaner, the world is more secure, and thank God, our Nation is more united."", ""To all the men and women across this country who have created our jobs, taught our children, patrolled our streets, and kept America safe throughout our world, I say America's success is your success; this victory is your victory. I thank you from the bottom of my heart."", ""Now, my fellow Americans, a vast new century lies before us. It will be a time more full of opportunity for people to live out their dreams than any in human history. We have committed this night to continuing our journey, to doing the hard work that will build our bridge to the 21st century, to give the young people here and those all across America the America they deserve and their children and their children's children."", 'But we have work to do. We have work to do to keep our economy growing steady and strong, by balancing the budget while we honor our duties to our families, our parents, and our children, and our duty to pass on to our children the Earth God gave us. We have work to do to give all of our children the gift of an education, to make sure every 8-year-old can read; every 12-year-old can log on to the Internet; and yes, every single 18-year-old in this country willing to work for it can have a college education.', 'We have work to do to make the permanent under class in this country a thing of the past, to lift our fellow citizens who are poor from the degradation of welfare dependency to the pride and dignity of work. We have work to do to strengthen our families; to help our parents succeed at home and at work; to keep our children safe from harm in their schools, their streets, their homes, and their communities; to clean up our environment so that our children grow up next to parks, not poison; to tell them that drugs are wrong and illegal and they can kill them; to teach them right from wrong.', 'My fellow Americans, I will do all I can to advance these causes. But all our citizens must do their part to continue the upsurge of personal responsibility that in the last 4 years has brought crime to a 10-year low, child support collections to an all-time high, and reduced the welfare rolls. Will you help me do that? [Applause] We must do it together.', 'We must make our democracy stronger by enacting real, bipartisan campaign finance reform. Talk is no longer enough; we must act and act now. And the American people will be watching the leaders of both parties to see who is willing not just to talk but to act. I am willing to act, and I ask others to join me.', ""And we must keep America the world's indispensable nation, finishing the unfinished business of the cold war, meeting the new threats to our security through terrorism and the proliferation of dangerous weapons, and seizing these extraordinary opportunities to extend our values of peace and democracy and prosperity."", 'Every American here tonight and every American within the sound of my voice can take pride in the fact that in these last few years, for the first time in all of human history, a majority of the human beings living on this globe live under democracies where the people rule.', ""The challenges we face, they're not Democratic or Republican challenges, they're American challenges. What we know from the budget battles of the last 2 years and from the remarkable success of the last few weeks of this Congress is the lesson we have learned for the last 220 years: What we have achieved as Americans of lasting good, we have achieved by working together."", ""So let me say to the leaders of my Democratic Party and the leaders of the Republican Party, it is time to put country ahead of party. We do not know the final outcome of the congressional elections, but we know this: the races are close; the American people have been closely divided; the Congress, whatever happens, will be closely divided. They are sending us a message: work together, meet our challenges, put aside the politics of division, and build America's community together."", 'On this beautiful night, when we have shared so much joy and so much music and so much laughter and so much pride, it is hard for me to believe that it was 23 years ago when I first began to go to the people of Arkansas to ask for their support. The most lasting and important thing that I have learned in all those 23 fleeting years is this: When we are divided we defeat ourselves, but when we join our hands and build our families and our communities and our country, America always wins. What we need to do is to do the work of America the way we seek to do the work of raising our children and doing our work and supporting our religious institutions and our community institutions. If we would simply be Americans, the way we seek to live in all of our other roles, there is no stopping America. Our best days are still ahead.', 'And so I say, when we look into our hearts and simply ask what is right for the American people and the future of our children, when we set aside our differences and build on our shared values of faith and family and work, when we roll up our sleeves and work together, America always wins. And my fellow Americans, America is going to keep winning these next 4 years.', 'Let me say that, as all of you here from my native State know, I believe this and I have tried to live by it because there is no person in America who has been given more gifts than I have; there is no person in America tonight who feels more humble in the face of this victory than I do. Fifty years ago, when I was born in a summer storm to a widowed mother in a small town in the southwest part of our State, it was unimaginable that someone like me could have ever become President of the greatest country in human history. It has been, for me, a remarkable journey, not free of failure but full of adventure and wonder and grace. I have worked hard to serve, but I did not get here on my own.', 'Every step along the way, for these last 23 years and long before, there was a teacher, a doctor, a neighbor, a parent, a friend, a wife, a daughter who always had time to care, who always tried to give me instruction and encouragement, and who never gave up. I got here tonight, my fellow Americans, because America gave me a chance.', 'That is what all the children of America deserve. Our people have to give them the tools to give them not a guarantee but that real chance to live up to their God-given potential.', 'And I ask you to join me in that commitment. Every child deserves the main chance that I was given.', ""And so I say, again, let us resolve to run our country the way we try to run our lives. Whether you are the party of Thomas Jefferson or the party of Abraham Lincoln, whether you're an independent or unaffiliated, remember that we all belong to the greatest Nation in history. To us much has been given and much is still expected. We must rise to the challenge of building that bridge to the 21st century."", 'Tonight is a night for joy not just for us here but for all Americans. For the 53d time in our history our people have made their quiet and deliberate decision. They have come together with their powerful voice and expressed their will. Tonight we celebrate the miracle of America. Tomorrow we greet the dawn and begin our work anew.', 'I am more grateful than I can say. You have given me an opportunity and a responsibility that comes to few people. I will do my best. And together, we will—we will—build that bridge to the 21st century.', 'Thank you. Good night, and God bless America. Thank you.']"
146,William J. Clinton ,"November 06, 1996","[""Thank you. Let me join Tipper and Hillary and Al in telling you how glad I am to see all of you. I'm sorry we couldn't get everybody into the limited hotel space in Little Rock. Although, somehow or another, we had about 50,000 people in the street."", ""It's been a wonderful day. And I am full of gratitude to all of you and to all those whom you represent. I thank my Cabinet; I know that at least Secretaries Riley, O'Leary, and Brown are here. But all of them worked very, very hard. I thank Don Fowler. And along with Hillary and Tipper and Al and all of you, I send our prayers and best wishes to Don and his wife tomorrow. And I thank Chris Dodd for speaking out in his brave and aggressive and incredibly articulate way. And we did pretty well in Connecticut last night. I think that the people there agreed with him instead of all those that were attacking us and running us down."", 'I thank Marvin Rosen for taking on this hard job and doing it well and Peter Knight and all of our wonderful campaign staff and Richard Sullivan all the people at the DNC. I thank Terry McAuliffe and Laura Hartigan; they worked so hard with all of their people to make sure our campaign was financed early and well.', 'I want to thank those who entertained us tonight, and thank all of you. There are a lot of people in this audience and around this country who played a major role in this campaign.', ""I feel I have to say a special word of thanks to the mayors that are here. I know that Dennis Archer and also Mayor Ed Rendell of Philadelphia are here. I don't know if there are any other mayors, but if there are mayors or Governors here I don't know about, I thank you very much for what you've done. Thank you, Reverend Jesse Jackson, for what you did in this campaign and what you do in every campaign, all the miles you traveled, all the speeches you gave. Thank you for going to California and standing up, as I did, for what we believe. We don't always win when we stand up for what we believe, but we always come out ahead. And I thank you, sir, for that."", 'Let me say that a campaign is a fascinating thing—the people who give and give and give of their time, their money, their heart. This was an unusual campaign for me, in terms of the difference from the one before, because this time, everywhere I went I could actually see the evidence of our collective endeavors.', 'I was in Denver the other night and we had a nice little crowd and then folks were standing by the ropeline the way you are. I just was walking down the ropeline, and I started shaking hands with people. And within 5 minutes, I met a young woman who had obviously been a victim of domestic violence, who thanked me for the Violence Against Women Act, the hotline, the fact that we were moving to bring down domestic violence.', 'Then there were three women standing there with a little sign that said, ""Thank you for putting more money into breast cancer research,"" who knew that we had uncovered now two of the genes which cause breast cancer and may someday be able to not only actually cure those cancers early but even to find out enough to prevent them in the first place.', 'And then I met a man—a big, big man who reached across four or five folks and shook hands with me and said, ""I wish my wife were here tonight, but we adopted a baby 2 months ago and because of the family leave law, she\'s able to take a little time off from work to integrate that baby into our home life without losing her job.""', ""And then I met a young man who said he had dropped out. But when we passed this new law to reform the college loan process so that he could pay the loan back as a percentage of his income and he didn't have to worry about going broke anymore, he had gone from being a college dropout to a good student in microbiology."", 'And then I met a lovely young woman who happened to be the daughter of one of the Federal agents who was there, who was a police officer in a smaller community in Colorado, who thanked me for the law enforcement part of the crime bill because her community was about to get five more police and she thought the children of her community would be safer and she would be safer doing her job because she was going to have help. That was in 5 minutes.', 'I was in Longview, Texas, the other day. We had 13,000 people at 8 in the morning, and that\'s hardly a hotbed of liberalism. [Laughter] I met a young single mother with two children who had gone back through the AmeriCorps program to serve in her community, get off public assistance, and was now going to the Kilgore Junior College there. And I met another woman whose husband had cancer, who got to save her job while she took care of her husband because of family leave. And I met a man who was a Vietnam veteran there with his wife. And he asked me—he said, ""What did you all ever do with that bill to help the veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange whose children got spina bifida?"" And I looked at him, and I said, ""I signed it yesterday, and now those people will get disability as well as medical benefits for the first time."" And he was real tall, so I was looking up at him—he was a head taller than I was—and he said, ""Well, thank you very much for her."" And I looked down at his little girl who was 12 years old in a wheelchair who had 12 operations because she contracted a condition that almost certainly she got because her husband served our country 20 years ago.', ""This is what this whole deal's about to me. You know, all this political business that you read in the newspaper, who's doing what and all that. And let me say something else. A lot of you contributed to our campaigns; a lot of you really stretched the limit; a lot of you went out and raised money for our campaigns. And you knew good and well you could have gotten a more direct benefit if you had put your money into the other side. I mean, they told you you'd get a big tax cut, and you maybe could have had other things. And you did it because you wanted your country to grow together."", ""As you know, I have said for 5 years, I think we ought to find a different system of financing our campaigns. But I want you to know that I appreciate that fact that you helped us stay competitive, even though the Republicans still raised $150 million or more, more than we did. We were able to stay competitive because people like you believed in the common ground of America. And I thank you for that. And I thank all of you for that. We had unprecedented financial support from the African-American community, from the Hispanic community. And I want to say as an Irish-American, I appreciate the support we got from every ethnic group, from the Jewish-Americans, from the Greek-Americans, and yes, from the Asian-Americans. I'm proud to have your support, and I thank you very much for it."", 'And let me say also, there are lots of other people who worked in our campaign. I went back to New Hampshire—I started my last day of my last campaign where we began our quest for the Presidency—and early in the morning in New Hampshire, on that last day, the 60 people who started out with me in 1991 and stayed with me when my death warrant was pronounced by the experts, gathered in a little restaurant. And they had all these pictures up everywhere. One of them was a young boy named Mike Morrison who was only a high school junior when I ran the last time and is now in college and was finally able to vote for me. And he said, ""Mr. President,"" he said, ""I\'m in college now, and I\'m a straight-A student."" And I said, ""Well, Mike, what do you like? What\'s your favorite courses?"" And he said, ""I like creative writing and critical thinking, and I\'m writing essays."" And he said, ""You know, my teachers at our school, they think I should submit my essays to magazines, Readers\' Digest and some others."" And we talked about it awhile, and I thought about the first time I saw that boy joining with his high school classmates, carrying my banner down the middle of the aisle at the New Hampshire Democratic Convention.', ""Mike Morrison gets up every day and gets into a wheelchair. And he's a big, strong boy, and he was raised by his mother on a very modest income. He worked hard for me in 1992. And on election day, he promised to be a poll worker, but his mother's car broke down. It was a cold winter day in New Hampshire, and Mike Morrison took his wheelchair 2 miles along the side of a highway from his home to the polling place to be there, to give us a chance to do what we have done these last 4 years."", ""And the thing I'm so proud of about our campaign is that we've got all kinds of people with all kinds of abilities. And all of us have some disabilities. And we have together made a difference, partly because we decided we were going to do what we were doing together. Justin Dart went to every State in America to organize Americans with disabilities for the Clinton/Gore campaign. That's one reason we won some of those States. God bless you, and thank you. There are people here who organized Republicans for Clinton/Gore, and I thank you for that. And I thank you for what you did. Your numbers were significant."", 'And last night, when the vote came in and all across the country, I thought of all the people I had met along this journey and all the people whose lives have been touched and how much better off we all are when we work to give everybody not a guarantee but at least a chance, a real chance to be what God meant them to be.', ""I am very proud of you. I want you to be very proud of this campaign. I want you to be very proud of what has happened. There are millions and millions and millions of people whose lives have been directly touched by the fact that we offered them a chance to have a second chance—to have their main chance to be what they ought to be. And there's lots more to do."", ""But we should be very grateful we happen to be here in America at the time that I'm convinced it is more possible for more people to live out their dreams than ever before, if we simply meet our challenges and move ourselves closer to our ideals. And it has fallen to us now to do that."", ""The people decided to leave the Congress in the hands of the Republicans, but they sent a very strong message. A lot of the offices they won, they won by less than 1,000 votes. They don't want meanness. They don't want the politics of personal destruction. They want us to put the people first, the future first, and work together. All of that, too, you contributed to making happen. The whole feeling in this country is so different from what it was just a couple of years ago, and you helped to make that happen."", ""So I ask you tonight—I ask you tonight to sort of hold back your shoulders and take a deep breath and be very proud because you helped to make our democracy work and, of course, all of us believe, to make the right decision. And I ask you to wake up tomorrow— I hope, like me, you'll be a little less tired than you are tonight—but I ask you to wake up tomorrow with a new sense of optimism about your country, a new sense of belief in the future, and a new determination to continue the work of citizenship. We are making a difference. We're going to make a big difference in the next 4 years. And everybody's got a role to play. And everybody has something to do."", ""In closing, let me say a special word of thanks to Tipper and to Al and to Hillary. We four have had an unusual partnership. I doubt that there's been anything quite like it in the history of the Presidency and the Vice Presidency. But it has served America well."", ""And if I had served out my term as Governor and had been elected to another term as Governor instead of running for President, George Clinton and Bill Clinton would have been the two longest serving Governors in American history, and we could have been on a different list. So I think it's a pretty distinguished list, Mr. Vice President, myself."", ""Let's have a good time tonight. Let's wake up tomorrow proud that we won. And let's think about what we can do to build that bridge to the 21st century."", 'Thank you, and God bless you.']"
