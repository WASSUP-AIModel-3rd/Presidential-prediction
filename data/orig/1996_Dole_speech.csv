0,            Robert Dole          ,"April 10, 1995","['Thank you, Governor Graves, Senator Kassebaum. Good morning friends -- Elizabeth, Robin, and I thank you for that tremendous welcome. It\'s great to be in Kansas. Of course, I\'m not the first Kansan to say, ""there\'s no place like home."" But for me, the words have special meaning. Wherever I have traveled in this life, I have never forgotten where I came from -- or where I go home to.', 'Whatever lessons I have applied in public life were first learned here as a member of the Kansas House of Representatives. These days I spend much of my time in another capitol. You see many things from atop the hill in Washington where I work -- but you can see America from here.', 'Common sense and uncommon sensitivity: that\'s the Kansas way. It\'s what made Dwight Eisenhower a great general and a great President. And it\'s what prompted Alf Landon with his unique wisdom to say, ""there are some intelligent people in Washington, but there are more of \'em in Kansas."" I hasten to add the same applies to forty nine other states.', 'But then, Kansans have never had to look to Washington, DC for a sense of compassion or community. As a young man in a small town my parents taught me to put my trust in God, not government, and never confuse the two. Something else I learned, learned the hard way -- that while self reliance is an essential part of the American character, so is the spirit of community that reaches out to those wounded in body or soul.', ""When I went off to war it was to defend a community of values unique in all the world. I came back sustained by the love and generosity of friends and neighbors who renewed my sense of life's possibilities. Over the years they have given me opportunities for service which I can never hope to repay."", 'Because they restored my spirit in a time of trial I have dedicated myself to restoring the spirit of America. And so today, tempered by adversity, seasoned by experience, mindful of the world as it is -- yet confident it can be made better -- I have come home to Kansas with a grateful heart to declare that I am a candidate for the Presidency of the United States.', 'The view many Americans see this morning is a sobering one. We are troubled about the direction our country is taking. Our values are under constant assault from our public and cultural institutions. We feel threatened by the random incidents of violent crime. Too many of our schools, which were once passports to opportunity, have become demoralizing places. Welfare has become a misery subsidy fostering illegitimacy and generations of dependency. And yet the deficit keeps growing, taxes keep increasing, and the government keeps demanding more and more authority over our lives.', 'None of this should come as a surprise. For much of this century power and wealth alike have flowed from grassroots Americans to a federal government which exploded to meet the twin crises of economic depression and global war. Yet, the lifejacket of one generation can become the straightjacket of the next. In giving to Washington our responsibility to address problems close to their source, Americans have unwittingly encouraged the Federal government to become too large, too remote, too unresponsive, and too undemocratic to be representative.', 'However, another America is waiting -- an America strong again in heart and sure of mind. I would like to lead us there.', ""Our problems are not too difficult to handle. It's just that our leaders have grown too isolated from places like Topeka -- embarrassed by the values here. They seem to have lost the idea that we are -- and must remain -- one nation under God. We are bound by our heritage to a set of common values: hard work, integrity, responsibility -- these values have always been the source of our strength and the glue that holds us together."", 'Our country must again have leaders who believe in our people and are proud of our values. We need leaders who will summon from each of us the best of our character, who will call us as a nation to our full potential. I want to be president so I can do this for America.', 'My mandate as President would be to rein in the Federal government in order to set free the spirit of the American people; to reconnect our government in Washington with the common sense values of our citizens; and to reassert American interests wherever and whenever they are challenged around the world.', 'My guide in this would be the final piece of the Bill of Rights -- the Tenth Amendment. It reads, ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states ... or to the people.""', 'When those words were written by our Founding Fathers more than 200 years ago, they were an affirmation of a radical new theory of politics -- a theory based on the need to limit the powers of the central government in order to unleash the unlimited potential of the people. The Federal government should do only those things specifically called for in the Constitution. All others should remain with the states or the people. It is a philosophy of freedom conceived in liberty, tested by history, yet too often ignored in Washington. I intend to restore it.', 'In the last election, the American people sent an unmistakable message to Washington. With rare clarity, they reaffirmed their faith in themselves and a healthy amount of skepticism about government.', 'If we are truly to rein in government, we must have a President who is more than a clever apologist for the status quo. In 1992, Bill Clinton ran for president as the candidate of change. In 1996, he will seek reelection as a candidate pledged to prevent change at all cost.', 'We need a President who will do more than say ""no"" to every spending cut, ""no"" to every attempt to return power and money to the states. We need a President who shares our values, embraces our agenda and who will lead the fight for the fundamental change America chose last November. We need a President who will say ""yes"" to the American people, and that is the kind of President I intend to be.', 'And while on the subject of creating a government that will say ""yes"" to the American people, let me make one fundamental belief crystal clear: we can cut taxes and balance the budget. Middle class families are forced to send too much of their hard-earned money to Washington. We should provide a tax credit for children and remove the marriage penalty to strengthen our families. And we should cut the capital gains tax to stimulate economic growth, create new jobs, and expand opportunity for all our people.', 'That is just the first step, not the last. We need a president committed to making our tax system lower, fairer, flatter, simpler -- so that ordinary people like you and me could fill out our tax form without a lawyer or an accountant or both.', ""Balancing the budget will also be a top priority; we cannot continue mortgaging our children's future. We will give the President the line item veto and we will give the American people a Balanced Budget Amendment."", ""But that is only the beginning. Reining in the government means streamlining the entire Federal bureaucracy, getting its nose out of places the government just shouldn't be. We should work our way through the alphabet soup of government, asking this question: Is this program a basic function of limited government, or is it an example of how government has lost faith in the judgment of our people?"", 'The best place to begin is with four of the most ineffective, burdensome and meddlesome departments: Education, Housing and Urban Development, Energy, and Commerce. Together they spend more than $74 billion per year and employ more than 74,000 workers.', ""Let's close down the Education Department and spend the money on our children, not bureaucracies and red tape; and let's implement school choice to return power to parents. HUD has become a cash cow for big city mayors and the well-connected. We should give housing vouchers to those who need them and get the government out of the landlord business altogether. Energy would function better as an agency within the Department of Defense. And more than half of what the Department of Commerce does has nothing to do with commerce or trade -- duplicated by 71 other governmental departments, agencies, and offices."", 'And there are other questions we should ask. We spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the Endowments for the Arts and Humanities. Why is the Federal government in the culture business? In this explosion of the information age, why do we have a Corporation for Public Broadcasting?', 'There are a host of other areas that cry out for reform. I will be talking about them at greater length in the year ahead. Welfare is one. The Federal system has failed. Why are liberals in Washington so afraid to turn welfare decision-making over to our governors and state legislatures? There is already considerable evidence that they can do much better.', 'Affirmative action is another Federal policy out of control. Discrimination is wrong, immoral. This is America. We should have a color blind society. But fighting discrimination should never be used to divide Americans by race, ethnic background, or gender.', 'There is one area where the Federal government must work in partnership with our state and local governments -- and that area is crime. Today, a criminal committing a serious crime has less than a ten percent chance of going to jail. And once in jail that criminal will serve only a fraction of his sentence.', 'We should put an end to parole for violent offenders. Put limits on the endless and often frivolous appeals clogging our courts. Remove teenagers who commit serious, violent crimes from juvenile courts and try them as adults. We should be more concerned with the rights of victims than the privileges of criminals. And we must rededicate ourselves to the war on drugs.', ""Finally, let me touch for a moment on America's place in the world. There is one responsibility only the Federal government has, and that is to protect our freedom. We must never be reluctant about our greatness or ashamed of our national strength."", 'We must stop placing the agenda of the United Nations before the interests of the United States. When we take our revolution to the White House in 1996, we will vow that American policies will be determined by us, not by the United Nations. Let us remember that America has been the greatest force for good the world has ever known.', 'I was reminded of that on the 50th anniversary of D-Day last summer, when the eyes of the world were focused on the beaches of France. I was there and witnessed the emotion as memories came flooding back -- memories of the heroism, the sacrifices and pain men and women suffered.', 'Before visiting France, I traveled to Northern Italy where I served in the 10th Mountain Division. While revisiting the battle sites, I thought about why we had been sent there, about the America of our youth, the America we were risking our lives to protect, and about our hopes for the generations who would follow us. And then I thought about the America we live in now -- an America still great and still the beacon of freedom around the world, but an America that is headed in the wrong direction.', 'Standing there gazing across those peaceful fields I thought of why it is critical to have a president who knows what made America great, who knows what has been sacrificed to keep us free, and who would do all in his power to lead America back to her place in the sun.', ""My friends, I have the experience. I've been tested, tested in many ways. I am not afraid to lead, and I know the way. Let us rein in our government to set the spirit of the American people free. Let us renew our moral convictions and strengthen our families by returning to fundamental values. Together, let us reassert our rightful place as a great nation."", 'We should do it for ourselves -- we owe it to our children. We must act to be worthy of the gift our ancestors sacrificed so much for: to ensure the next century will dawn on a new beginning of American greatness ... prosperity ... and freedom. Let us do it together. Let us begin today.', 'Thank you.']"
1,            Robert Dole          ,"May 31, 1995","[""I want to talk about a specific matter tonight. I may not win an Oscar, but I'll talk about it anyway. I want to talk to you tonight about the future of America - about issues of moral importance, matters of social consequence."", 'Last month, during my announcement tour, I gave voice to concerns held across this country about what is happening to our popular culture. I made what I thought was an obvious point, a point that worries countless American parents: that one of the greatest threats to American family values is the way our popular culture ridicules them. Our music, movies, television and advertising regularly push the limits of decency, bombarding our children with destructive messages of casual violence and even more casual sex. And I concluded that we must hold Hollywood and the entire entertainment industry accountable for putting profit ahead of common decency.', ""So here I am in California — the home of the entertainment industry and to many of the people who shape our popular culture. And I'm asking for their help. I believe our country is crying out for leaders who will call us as a people to our better nature, not to profit from our weaknesses; who will bring back our confidence in the good, not play on our fears of life's dark corners. This is true for those of us who seek public office. And it is true for those who are blessed with the talent to lead America's vaunted entertainment industry."", 'Actors and producers, writers and directors, people of talent around the world dream of coming to Hollywood. Because if you are the best, this is where you are. Americans were pioneers in film, and dominate world-wide competition today. The American entertainment industry is at the cutting edge of creative excellence, but also too often the leading edge of a culture becoming dangerously coarse.', ""I have two goals tonight. One is to make crystal clear to you the effect this industry has on America's children, in the hope that it will rise to their defense. And the other is to speak more broadly to America about the corporate executives who hide behind the lofty language of free speech in order to profit from the debasing of America."", 'There is often heard in Hollywood a kind of ""aw shucks"" response to attempts to link societal effects with causes in the culture. It\'s the ""we just make movies people want"" response. I\'ll take that up in a minute. But when they go to work tomorrow, when they sift through competing proposals for their time and their money, when they consider how badly they need the next job, I want the leaders of the entertainment industry to think about the influence they have on America\'s children.', 'Let there be no mistake: televisions and movie screens, boomboxes and headsets are windows on the world for our children. If you are too old, or too sophisticated or too close to the problem, just ask a parent. What to some is art, to our children is a nightly news report on the world outside their limited experience. What to some is make believe, to them is the ""real skinny"" on the adult world they are so eager to experience. Kids know first-hand what they see in their families, their schools, their immediate communities. But our popular culture shades their view of the ""real world."" Our children believe those paintings in celluloid are reflections of reality. But I don\'t recognize America in much of what I see.', ""My voice and the rising voices of millions of other Americans who share this view represent more than the codgy old attempt of one generation to steal the fun of another. A line has been crossed — not just of taste, but of human dignity and decency. It is crossed every time sexual violence is given a catchy tune. When teen suicide is set to an appealing beat. When Hollywood's dream factories turn out nightmares of depravity."", 'You know what I mean. I mean ""Natural Born Killers."" ""True Romance."" Films that revel in mindless violence and loveless sex. I\'m talking about groups like Cannibal Corpse, Geto Boys and 2 Live Crew. About a culture business that makes money from ""music"" extolling the pleasures of raping, torturing and mutilating women; from ""songs"" about killing policemen and rejecting law. The mainstreaming of deviancy must come to an end, but it will only stop when the leaders of the entertainment industry recognize and shoulder their responsibility.', ""But let me be very clear: I am not saying that our growing social problems are entirely Hollywood's fault. They are not. People are responsible for their actions. Movies and music do not make children into murderers. But a numbing exposure to graphic violence and immorality does steal away innocence, smothering our instinct for outrage. And I think we have reached the point where our popular culture threatens to undermine our character as a nation."", ""Which brings me to my second point tonight. Our freedom is precious. I have risked my life to defend it, and would do so again. We must always be proud that in America we have the freedom to speak without Big Brother's permission. Our freedom to reap the rewards of our capitalist system has raised the standard of living around the world. The profit motive is the engine of that system, and is honorable. But those who cultivate moral confusion for profit should understand this: we will name their names and shame them as they deserve to be shamed. We will contest them for the heart and soul of every child, in every neighborhood. For we who are outraged also have the freedom to speak. If we refuse to condemn evil, it is not tolerance but surrender. And we will never surrender."", 'Let me be specific. One of the companies on the leading edge of coarseness and violence is Time Warner. It is a symbol of how much we have lost. In the 1930s its corporate predecessor, Warner Brothers, made a series of movies, including ""G-Men,"" for the purpose of restoring ""dignity and public confidence in the police."" It made movies to help the war effort in the early 1940s. Its company slogan, put on a billboard across from the studio, was ""Combining Good Citizenship with Good Picture Making.""', 'Today Time Warner owns a company called Interscope Records which columnist John Leo called the ""cultural equivalent of owning half the world\'s mustard gas factories."" Ice-T of ""Cop Killer"" fame is one of Time Warner\'s ""stars."" I cannot bring myself to repeat the lyrics of some of the ""music"" Time Warner promotes. But our children do. There is a difference between the description of evil through art, and the marketing of evil through commerce. I would like to ask the executives of Time Warner a question: Is this what you intended to accomplish with your careers? Must you debase our nation and threaten our children for the sake of corporate profits?', 'And please don\'t answer that you are simply responding to the market. Because that is not true. In the movie business, as Michael Medved points out, the most profitable films are the ones most friendly to the family. Last year, the top five grossing films were the blockbusters ""The Lion King"", ""Forrest Gump"", shown by being here, and feel a great sense of hope and confidence that together we will succeed - not only in this Presidential race, but in our larger mission to reaffirm the goodness and greatness of the United States of America.', 'Thank you very much.']"
2,            Robert Dole          ,"June 17, 1995","[""Thank you, Senator Kempthorne, and thank you all for that kind welcome. It's a privilege to speak with you today. I've been eager to participate in your discussion about how to solve some of America's toughest problems; how to make our cities once again a source of American strength. And I come in awe and admiration: you've got, perhaps, the toughest job in politics."", 'Sometimes, when it\'s two in the morning and even C-SPAN\'s audience has gone to bed - when 100 Senators are pulling in 100 different directions, when there\'s an abundance of good ideas, urgent causes and absolutely no money I think what a hopeless, thankless task I have. But then I always pause and say, ""Well, at least I\'m not a mayor.""', ""You have a most difficult job, but also a most exciting one. America's cities concentrate every problem in our society, but also every resource of our national spirit. You have been tapped by history to serve during a great turning point in America's experiment with democracy. And you are rising nobly to the challenge."", 'For decades now our cities have been known as cauldrons of unrest. Today they are also hotbeds of innovation. A critical mass of progress is erupting around the country, led by mayors of both parties. In Indianapolis, Steve Goldsmith has tapped the competitive power of the marketplace to make government more efficient. In Columbus, Greg Lashutka has led the national fight against unfunded mandates. In Chicago, Richard Daley has been a pioneer in privatization and a warrior against Federal programs that entrench bureaucracy and reward special interests. In Jersey City, Bret Schundler has built a coalition for empowerment across the lines of class and race.', 'You have rediscovered things we never should have forgotten: that when individuals are not crushed by taxes or repressed by regulation, they perform wonders of renewal and hope. That the poor are not problems to be solved, they are people waiting to be included. That the wealth of our cities is not built on Federal handouts or even determined by the luck of natural advantages. Successful cities rely on the enterprise and creativity of the people who live in them, and no amount of Federal intervention or redistribution of wealth will ever change that fact.', 'I come from a small town on a vast plain. But I know that our cities embody the aspirations of our nation.', ""I serve in the Congress and I'm running for President. But I know that the Federal Government is not and should no longer be the focus of power in America."", 'And I am a Republican — a leader in a party not always known as the first friend of cities, not always thought of as the champion of those who feel shut out of the American dream. But that perception is changing.', 'For this much is clear for all who would lead: we are one America. Our destiny cannot be divided. There will be no renewal apart from the renewal of our cities. So we must offer an agenda for the future that counts on the success of urban America.', 'Federal paternalism is the dying doctrine of the Great Society. But what should we offer in its place? We must create a new Federal partnership with our cities. For our nation to overcome the problems that plague us, power and resources must be returned to their source, to you — to the American people and to the states and cities they more directly control.', ""For example, unfunded mandates have been flooding out of Washington in recent years, drowning you in other people's priorities while forcing you to ignore many of your own. More than a third of many city budgets is dedicated to complying with Federal mandates - promises made by Congress it could not afford to keep, so instead it forced you to keep them."", ""On the first day of the new Congress we started action to stop that. Washington now will live by a simple rule: if it's important enough to mandate, it's important enough to pay for. But stopping new mandates is just the first step. We'll continue to look at existing requirements and consider revision or repeal. Two of the grandest sounding have caused the most problems. The Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act are two of the most burdensome programs passed by Congress — and I will do all in my power to reopen them to bring you the relief you need."", ""And I propose going further. If our cities are to marshal their own resources to meet their own problems, they must not suffer trickle-down mandates from state governments, either. Many of the responsibilities shed by Washington will not end up in statehouses, but in the city halls of America. When our cities must pick up the slack we must make sure they don't have to pick up the tab, too."", ""And speaking of picking up the money, later this year the Senate will revisit the 1994 Crime Bill. As part of this effort, we will transform the $9 billion police-hiring program into a law-enforcement block grant, giving states and cities the flexibility they need to fight crime on their streets, not statistics in a national trend. What does your city need most? Is it more police? Or better technology? Maybe it's more squad cars. One thing for sure, you don't need more opinions from Washington bureaucrats. You are on the front lines in the war against crime and you must be given a free hand to fight it."", 'Mayor Ashe recently dropped by my office and made it very clear how important it is to you that the cities be allowed to apply directly for the block grant funds. I am working with my colleague, Sen. Hatch, to make sure that happens.', ""It is my belief that our block grant legislation should differ in three ways from President Clinton's proposal. First, it should provide more resources for law enforcement, perhaps as much as $12 billion total. Second, as I have mentioned, it should provide more flexibility for Mayors and local officials. And finally, it should target a portion of the funds to those cities that are in the most urgent need of help — cities with the highest violent crime rates."", ""I know many of you have concerns about adopting this approach when it comes to welfare, but we must. To cling to the failure of the current system would betray the trust of our offices. Throughout our history America has been the country where anyone could make it; where the poor didn't begrudge the rich because they intended to be rich one day, too. Parents would sweat and sacrifice, sure in the knowledge that their children's lives would be better than their own. Sons of immigrants and daughters of the underprivileged would stand on the shoulders of the generation who came before. But today we are on the brink of creating a permanent underclass in America. What chance does a child really have when he is born into a family without a father, when the mother is an addict and the culture teaches him not to marry, not to work and to mock the sanctity of human life?"", 'The final welfare reform bill has not been passed, but the outlines are clear. We will transform welfare from a tangle of red tape into a block grant to create local flexibility and encourage homegrown innovation. Our goal is not to provide waivers at the end of a paperwork trail, but to provide states and cities with freedom itself. Our objective is not to give you permission, it is to give you power.', ""This same philosophy also should be applied to your most awesome responsibility: educating your cities' children. Our public schools were once the source of hope and opportunity. Too often today they have become dangerous and demoralizing places. I have proposed abolishing the Department of Education and sending the money to parents and communities and school districts. And to give parents even more control, we should establish education vouchers so they can choose the best school for their child."", ""And while we're at it, we should shut down the Department of Housing and Urban Development, too. We should privatize many of its functions and get the Federal Government out of the landlord business all together. The hundreds of Federal urban aid programs administered by over 15,000 bureaucrats should be rolled into a single block grant and given to you to do with as you see fit."", 'President Clinton has warned that giving states the kind of flexibility I am describing could become ""a race to the bottom"" — as if only the Federal Government can be trusted to care for our children and elevate the poor.', ""That's not only wrong, it's insulting. It assumes that state and local government leaders are just waiting for the chance to betray their own people. But betrayal has come from only one direction: an aristocracy of Federal experts whose faces you do not know and whose values you may not share. When Federal officials claim a monopoly on public spirit, they demonstrate the arrogance of a failed elite and the ignorance of those who will not learn."", 'I do not accept a philosophy of ""every man for himself."" I do not believe that government is always the enemy. But in communities that work for everyone, we learn some basic lessons — lessons of leadership that apply to cities in the shadow of smokestacks, or towns in the middle of wheat fields:', 'The lesson that compassion is most powerful in local communities, not in distant bureaucracies.', 'That accountability is most direct at levels of government that people can touch.', 'That benefits without expectations will undermine our character and frustrate all our good intentions.', 'That work gives meaning to our lives, and that we should expect it of every able-bodied American.', 'That it is ultimately more important to punish crime than to explain it.', 'And there is one more element of leadership that demands our attention. It is increasingly clear that many of the problems we face as a nation concern not our economy, but our national character. Violence, illegitimacy, a declining work ethic — all these things have a moral component that laws cannot reach.', 'To put it simply: values count, not just in our lives, but in our society. The economy will never be strong enough to transform a neighborhood where 80 percent of children lack a father, and legitimate jobs are dismissed as ""chump change."" There will never be enough prisons or police to enforce order in our society if there is growing disorder in our souls.', 'This places public officials at every level in a new role — a role that may not be comfortable, but which has become essential. We must speak, not just for innovative policies, but for enduring values like family, work, responsibility and tolerance. I decided that I must use the bully pulpit to discuss these issues if I am to lead. And I urge you to conclude the same. Our times demand more of us than policies and programs - they require a vision of the kind of people we aim to be.', 'And yes, this means speaking out about our popular culture and entertainment - the most powerful and pervasive teacher of our children. It is harder to rise out of poverty when your culture derides the values that make that effort possible. It is harder to control crime when ""role models"" preach impulsive violence.', 'When large companies market music that celebrates the murder of policemen and the rape of women, they say they are responding to consumer demand. But while they reap the profits, our cities reap a bitter harvest of violence. And while those who would market evil through commerce hate the light of scrutiny, I will continue to use my freedom to call them to account. I will name their names until they feel the shame their actions deserve. This is not a matter of right and left, it is a matter of right and wrong. And I hope that you will join me.', 'Your cities award cable franchises. Speak to the corporations which seek them. Make their impact and their responsibility clear. You grant business licenses to local music stores and outlets for national chains. Speak to their CEOs about what bothers you about their business. You can at least be heard. And that may be enough.', 'You and I must make a choice in politics: we can fight change or use it; abandon hope or instill it. We can be rivals for power or allies in innovation.', 'Urban America is beset with many problems. But a thousand cities may have a thousand solutions, and they must be free to pursue them. Once we spoke of America as a ""city on a hill."" Today, if we are to reclaim her greatness, we must share a vision of many shining cities, on many hills, each with the power to build a future of freedom and opportunity and hope for every man, woman, and child who calls them home.', 'Thank you very much.']"
3,            Robert Dole          ,"August 19, 1995","['Thank you, Dan Quayle , for that great introduction. I recall that back in 1988, Dan gave me the honor of delivering his nomination speech at the Republican National Convention. And, Dan, I\'m hoping that come next August in San Diego, I might have the opportunity to return the favor. I see a lot of friends here tonight: Chuck and Barbara Grassley, Terry and Chris Branstad, Jim and Elisabeth Leach, Bob and Billie Ray — and so many others. I think the highest compliment anyone ever paid me was back in 1988 when Chuck Grassley introduced me with the words: ""Bob, you\'re one of us."" A lot of people lose their way in Washington, but those words help me keep my sense of direction. You know what I mean. If you grow up in rural America, there\'s always a grain elevator on the horizon. And if you just keep it in sight, you\'re never far from home. That\'s how I feel about the phrase, ""One of Us."" That\'s how I feel about Iowa.', 'Minutes up the highway from here are farms and towns like the ones I knew as a boy. Those of us who were raised in rural America grew up with a common set of values, a code of living that stays with us all our lives. Love of God and country and family. Commitment to honesty, decency and personal responsibility. Self-reliance tempered by a sense of community. Our great cities can be exciting and magnificent places, but the values nurtured here in the heart of America are the ones that have guided us throughout our history. Those values made us the greatest country on earth. And there is no doubt in my mind that the secret to getting our country back on track is simply to return to them as a matter of national policy.', 'There are endless reasons to end the failed Presidency of Bill Clinton, but renewing the strength of America by restoring our social and moral order has got to be somewhere near the top of the list.', 'When I spoke out against the Hollywood movies and music which celebrate sex and violence, it touched a cord with people everywhere. Americans are concerned about the loss of any sense of shame or standard of decency in our popular entertainment. Parents understand the pull of the culture. They know that televisions and movie screens, boomboxes and headsets are windows on the world for our children — an advance report on the adult world our kids are so eager to experience.', 'Mickey Mantle also understood the dynamic. He was more than a terrific centerfielder with a great batting average. He was one of the greatest sports heroes America has ever known. Publicly, he was an idol of the culture who lived a private life at war with its values. And, in the end, that\'s what shortened his life. Perhaps his greatest moment came just a month before he died. He looked into the camera and told America\'s children: ""Don\'t be like me."" God bless Mickey Mantle.', ""For that kind of personal responsibility has not yet been accepted by very many entertainment leaders, by those who produce our movies and music and television. Censorship isn't the answer. We don't need laws or regulations or government intimidation. But we do have a right and an obligation to speak out. To name names. To shame those who deserve to be shamed. Not to impose our morality on anyone else. But to stop the entertainment industry from imposing a debased morality on all the rest of us."", ""And we're having an effect. Since the spotlight was shone on the seamy productions of Time Warner, the company has put its gangsta rap label up for sale and fired the four top executives responsible for dragging it into the cultural sewer. That was a great first step. Thank you, Time Warner. We welcome you back to the community of responsible adults."", ""But it's not just the entertainment industry that's the problem. If the fabric of our society seems to be fraying, it's also due to the moral confusion evident in our government, our courts, our schools. Let me give you some examples."", ""Drug use is up again but enforcement and prevention have been scaled back. When our President warns about smoking, he's talking about cigarettes. Smoking will kill you and kids shouldn't do it.

Our schools are teaching recycling and AIDS prevention, but our kids can't add and they certainly aren't allowed to pray. Government policies intended to bring the races together instead are tearing us apart. Illegitimacy is epidemic, but our tax code penalizes marriage and welfare drives away fathers. In fact, the welfare dream of the Great Society has become a miserable nightmare in the 1990s — discouraging work and creating a near-permanent underclass in this country. Is this what we want for America?"", ""Across our country, parents and teachers, small businesses and farm families, cities and states are beginning to throw off the shackles of big government, to reject the mandates of the liberal elites who have pulled our country so far in the wrong direction. President Clinton has noticed this prairie fire, and has tried to join it. He gave a series of speeches this summer to outline his thinking. But this is his prescription for America: More affirmative action. No change in school prayer. Don't send welfare to the states. Nationalize health care. Politicize Medicare. Federalize education. Rig the results of our markets. And whatever you do, he says, don't criticize the government."", ""America's effort to bring its government to heel is unpleasant for those who believe the people are the problem and the solution is more government."", ""But no, Mr. President. Too much government is our trouble. Returning power to the people is the solution. And that's just what we're going to do."", ""Yes, we have problems. But they're not too difficult to handle. It's just that our government has gotten too big and our leaders have grown too isolated."", ""America's policies run counter to American values.

And as I look out at all the patriots who belong to the American Legion, I can't help but recall that perhaps the first speech I made outside Kansas was at an American Legion Hall in Indiana."", 'I was a freshman Congressman, and the local dinner committee knew they needed to find a way to encourage people to come to the dinner. When I arrived, I was whisked off to the local radio station, where the announcer was supposed to interview me to boost attendance. He began with a less than accurate rendition of my resume.', '""The guest at this evening\'s dinner,"" he said, ""will be Congressman Bob Doyle. He will speak at the American Legion Hall. Tickets have been slashed from three dollars to one dollar. A color television set will be given away. You must be present to win, and we\'re not going to draw until Doyle gets through talking. Doyle was born in Kansas, raised in Kansas, educated in Kansas. He fought in Italy, where he suffered a serious head injury. Then he went into politics.""', ""I don't know if they got all of you here today by promising a drawing for a television set, but I'm sure glad you're here."", ""You are Freedom's heroes and American patriots, and I'm proud to be among you. Each of you has answered America's call — whether it was to fight for our freedom, or to defend the peace in which we have prospered for so many years. Each of you knows what it means to wear the uniform of your country, to put your country first and to be willing to bear any sacrifice to keep her free. I assure you that we will never forget our obligation to those who have worn the uniform in service to our great nation. I know you all support our efforts to balance the federal budget — to stop the flow of red ink that threatens the future of our children and grandchildren. I also know many of you are concerned about funding for the activities of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Well, the federal budget will be balanced. And every program with the exception of Social Security will be scrutinized carefully. But the budget will not be balanced on the backs of America's Veterans."", 'Because of you, and those who came before you, we Americans are the freest people on earth. And you know as well as I do how we stay that way: we must remain the strongest country on earth.', ""That's what I want to talk with you about today. Keeping America strong — in her might and in her heart, in the face of external enemies and in the presence of threats from within. America is still the land of the free and the home of the brave, and a great century of hope and opportunity is about to unfold before us. But to claim that future, America needs your help. For some in America believe our might is no longer needed, and some think our definition of what it means to be an American is out of date."", ""Of course, neither is true. Can there be any doubt that the world is still a dangerous place? Yes, the Cold War is over. We won one of humanity's greatest struggles against totalitarianism and oppression. But today peace is threatened and dark forces are multiplying in almost every corner of the world. The Evil Empire may be gone, but its missiles still exist in a volatile, unstable and unpredictable region. Despite our protests, Russia is selling nuclear arms to Iran. Iraq is manufacturing gruesome biological and chemical weapons. North Korea will soon have nuclear capability. China is arming Pakistan with nuclear missiles while just across their contested border India already has them. And Central Europe is being eaten away by ethnic war and genocide."", 'The United Nations has been impotent and, until last week, the U.N. was calling the shots for NATO. Now should be a time of great American vigilance, and yet now Washington seems filled with people who want to dismantle our defenses.', 'One thing is clear: our defense budget has been cut too far, and too fast. In fact, this administration had set us on a path that would have ended with America spending about as much of our gross national product on defense as we were when Pearl Harbor was attacked, But the good news is that this year this Congress refused to go along. We rejected the policies that would lead us back to a hollow military. We kept the faith. We increased spending on defense.', ""For the demands of freedom require us to modernize our forces, to maintain our technological edge, and to ensure that America remains the world's one and only superpower. We will never apologize for that. Our goal is not just to be strong enough to turn back a threat. We must be so strong no one ever again is even tempted to threaten us, at all."", ""But if we are to return this country to greatness, we must do more than restore America's defenses. We must return as a people to the original concept of what it means to be American. This means tackling subjects the arbiters of political correctness don't even want discussed: For example, English must be recognized as America's official language. Western tradition and American greatness must be taught in our schools. And the Federal government must end its war on traditional American values."", 'America has always been more than just a place on a map, it has held a claim on our hearts. We are a nation dedicated to a proposition: that all men and women are created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain, inalienable rights. Our forefathers rejected race and religion as the forces to form a nation, choosing instead the ideals of freedom and democracy. t was a radical gamble, and ever since we have held it to be an article of faith that those who would be Americans must first abandon lesser allegiances. As Franklin Roosevelt once said, ""Americanism ... is not, and never was, a matter of race and ancestry.""', 'Succeeding waves of immigrants have been drawn to America by this idea. Lacking the centuries-old, primal bonds of other nations, we have used our language, our history and our code of values to make the American experiment work. We have used them to forge millions of diverse individuals into one people with a common purpose. Language, history and values: these are the strings that bind our hearts to America. These are the forces that have held us together - allowing us to be diverse and yet united, to absorb untold millions of immigrants while coming the closest any country ever has to the classless, upwardly mobile society of our ideals.', 'But these keys to unity are under attack from our government and from intellectual elites who seem embarrassed by America. What we see as opportunity they see as oppression. Where we see a proud past, they see a legacy of shame. What we hold as moral truth, they call intolerance. They have false theories, long dissertations and endless studies to back them up. But they know so much they have somehow missed the fact that the United States of America is the greatest force for good the world has ever known.', 'Yes, we have our faults. But part of what makes me so proud to be an American is the constant effort of our people to do better — to make our country right and good and just. Unfortunately some policies and programs born out of that desire have gone awry. Begun for the best of reasons and then hijacked by the embarrassed-to-be-American crowd, certain Federal programs are untying the strings of citizenship.', ""Affirmative action is one of those programs. Instead of making things better, it has made things worse. No amount of tinkering can rescue it. It was never supposed to be permanent. We know it has failed. Let's stop dividing Americans by race and get back to the simple principle of equal treatment for all."", ""That's why I have introduced legislation which would prohibit the Federal Government from ever using quotas, set-asides, or other race-based preferences in any form. Whether in employment, contracting or any other Federal program, our government must be in the business of bringing our citizens closer together, not tearing us apart."", 'But nowhere is the focus on what divides us more alarming than what is happening in our schools. The debate about what we teach our children is really a debate about who we are as a people, and whether we are one people any more at all. Do we embrace ideas that unite us, regardless of our sex or color or religion? Or are we just a jostling crowd of competing groups thrown by fate between two oceans?', 'If one of the most important missions of our schools is to make citizens of our children, and I believe that it is, fluency in English should be a central educational goal of every state in our Nation. English is the language in which we still speak to each other across the frontiers of culture and race. It is the language of the Constitution. It is the language in which we conduct our great national debates — an essential ingredient of democracy. Insisting that all our citizens are fluent in English is a welcoming act of inclusion, and insist on it we must.', 'Yes, schools should provide the language classes our immigrants and their families need, as long as their purpose is the teaching of English. We have done this since our founding to speed the melting of our melting pot. But we must stop the practice of multi-lingual education as a means of instilling ethnic pride, or as a therapy for low self-esteem or out of elitist guilt over a culture built on the traditions of the West. With all the divisive forces tearing at our country, we need the glue of language to help hold us together. If we want to ensure that all our children have the same opportunities in life, alternative language education should stop and English should be acknowledged once and for all as the official language of the United States.', 'And speaking of elitist guilt, yes, there have been dark moments in our past. There are still cruel elements in our culture. We should not sanitize them when we teach our children the history of America and Western civilization. But we should not politicize them, either, as too many educators and professors in our schools and universities today are attempting to do. There is a shocking campaign afoot among educators at all levels — most evident in the National History Standards already distributed to more than 20,000 teachers, administrators, and professors — to disparage America and disown the ideas and traditions of the West.', 'Let me give you some examples of what I mean. The History Standards, prepared with over $2 million in grants from the U.S. Department of Education and the National Endowment for the Humanities, suggest we teach our students about America by concentrating on some of our worst moments: the scourge of McCarthyism and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan. George Washington is never even described as our first President in this approach. Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, and Paul Revere disappear from the story of America. And the first time the Constitution is mentioned it is blamed for sidetracking the movement to end slavery. After years of that, would you love America?', ""The purpose of the National History Standards seems not to be to teach our children certain essential facts about our history, but to denigrate America's story while sanitizing and glorifying other cultures. This is wrong and it threatens us as surely as any foreign power ever has. We must use the bully pulpit to make it clear that we will not stand still and allow this campaign to be inflicted on our children."", 'Liberal, academic elites control more than our schools, of course. Any institution touched by government is ripe for infection, which is why we see this disdain for America turning up in government- funded television, art and now even our museums. When the Smithsonian created a display to commemorate the anniversary of Hiroshima — the day we effectively won a global war against the forces of evil — the message of the Smithsonian was that dropping the bomb was an act of American violence against Japanese culture. Somehow the Japanese were painted not as the aggressors, but as the victims of World War II. Veterans groups who complained were dismissed as ""special interests"" who couldn\'t be objective.', ""That's right. If you put your life on the line for America, if you love this country so much you're willing to die for it, maybe you do belong to a special interest — but that special interest used to be called the people of the United States. If you had predicted the Smithsonian debacle to the soldiers crawling up the beach in Okinawa, they would never have believed you. Today, even Japan has finally apologized for its atrocities and aggression, so maybe it's time the Embarrassed-About-America Crowd gets the message, too: We're proud of our country. And we won't put up with our tax dollars being used to drag it down or sow doubt about the nobility of America in the minds of our children."", ""We must remember: our children's embrace of the American idea is not automatic. We must teach them what we were taught and what we know to be true: that this country is one of history's most magnificent ideas. Our children must come to value freedom as dearly as every refugee fleeing persecution who sailed, swam or scrambled here to find it; as much as every soldier who died to preserve it. America must be in their hearts, as well as their heads. For it takes just one generation to snap the chain of freedom, one generation for a nation based on an idea to forget who we are."", 'One of the most powerful symbols we use to remind ourselves, of course, is Old Glory. Our flag is more than a piece of cloth, it is the embodiment of our sacred ideals. I grew up holding my hand over my heart and pledging allegiance to it. And perhaps one of our problems is that too few of us do that, anymore. We ought to teach children at an early age to respect the flag. And we certainly ought to stop its public denigration. I am proud to stand with the American Legion in supporting a Constitutional Amendment to protect our flag.', 'Which brings me to the subject of values — something I\'ve spoken a lot about this summer. To put it simply, values count, not just in our lives, but in our society. The economy will never be strong enough to transform a neighborhood where 80 percent of children lack a father, and legitimate jobs are dismissed as ""chump change."" There will never be enough prisons or police to enforce order in our society if there is growing disorder in our souls.', 'The vast majority of Americans still hold fast to the values that made America great, but now we must do more than just live by them. We must speak out about our values and insist that our culture and our government reflect them.', 'Yes, this means braving the ridicule of the cultural elites and speaking out about our popular entertainment. Our movies and music, advertising and television are having a profound impact on our children. And it\'s not for the good. It\'s much harder to rise out of poverty when the culture derides the values that make that possible. It\'s much harder for society to control crime when ""role models"" preach impulsive violence. Those who would market evil through commerce hate the light of scrutiny, but I will continue to use my freedom to call them to account. I will name their names until they feel the shame their actions deserve. Time Warner — the producers of some of the foulest rap music — has already begun to have second thoughts, and others will, too. This is not a matter of right and left, it is a matter of right and wrong. And I hope you will join me.', 'Love of God and country and family. Commitment to honesty, decency and personal responsibility. Self-reliance tempered by a sense of community. Those values made us the greatest country on earth. And there is no doubt in my mind that we can get our country back on track if we reassert them again as a people and if our government returns to them as a matter of national policy.', 'Everywhere in the world we see examples of nations divided against themselves — the tragedy of Bosnia is the most recent, most horrifying example. Even placid Canada today is threatened by ethnic separatism. But the idea of America, if we hold on to it, is what will save us from that fate.', 'In 1874, a black high school principal in Ohio said, ""In language, in civilization, in fears and in hopes we are Americans."" We are defined not by our bloodlines, but by our beliefs. In this beautiful New World, we have created a nation out of nations, overcoming differences with freedom.', ""But our freedom can never be taken for granted — we must always ensure its defense. And our diversity requires us to bind ourselves to the American idea in every way we can: by speaking one language, taking pride in our true history and embracing the traditional American values which have guided us from the beginning. These are the ways we remember who we are: free individuals united by democracy into the world's newest, greatest and still evolving race: the nation of Americans."", 'Thank you very much.']"

And it's a pleasure to be back in Chicago to share with you my hopes and ideas about America's economic future as we enter the 21st Century — the enormous opportunities before us, and the obstacles standing in our way."", ""For generations, Chicago has stood squarely in the heartland of America — a proud symbol of our nation's work ethic, entrepreneurial ingenuity, and economic power. In the last century, you were the gateway for the railroads that opened the American West. And today, Chicago is on the cutting edge of the technological revolution that is reordering the global economy."", 'When the technological revolution began, there were dire warnings that it would lead to greater government centralization and confer more power upon the few who controlled it. But look around. Exactly the opposite is happening. Power is rippling out to the people -a positive force of change for both democracy and free enterprise.', 'This revolution is widening the horizons for business, while demanding new restraints from government. Capital flows, as it always has, wherever the greatest opportunities exist for people to create new wealth. But it flees even more quickly when governments try to ""manage"" markets or ""soak the rich."" Open trade is creating vast new markets for goods and services and vast new possibilities for growth. But those gains are easily lost when governments try to devalue their currencies or retreat behind bureaucratic barriers to trade.', 'This profound transformation makes this a time of dynamism and innovation not seen since the days of Carnegie, Ford, and Morgan. Between 1980 and 1990, fully half the companies on the Fortune 500 dropped from the list as bold new upstarts displaced mature, older firms. Entire new industries began in garage workshops and grew to employ millions — a renewal of an American tradition some people thought had died with Edison.', ""But perhaps the most exciting fact about our emerging global economy is that government had very little to do with it. It was not driven by state planners in fact, they hardly saw it coming. It came about by individuals acting freely in the marketplace. By entrepreneurs creating products we could only dimly imagine just a decade ago. By nations abandoning backward protectionism and embracing free and open trade. America stands on the threshold of a fabulous future, with greater opportunities for economic growth and prosperity than at anytime during our nation's history."", ""Against this brilliant backdrop of unbounded potential stands the jarring contrast of the Clinton Administration's obsolete economic agenda and the weakening American economy."", ""At the very moment when nations around the world have rediscovered the promise of entrepreneurial capitalism, President Clinton has turned his back on it. Rather than expand incentives for America's risk-takers and entrepreneurs, President Clinton imposed the largest tax increase in American history — and imposed it retroactively. He refused to lift a finger when just one more vote in the Senate would have given America a Balanced Budget Amendment. He bitterly opposes our efforts to reduce the regulatory burden on private enterprise. He fights every effort to cut government spending. In fact, on every key issue, his solution isn't less government, but more government. Bigger government. More meddlesome government."", ""If President Clinton wants to join us in forging fundamental change in government, we'll welcome him to the conservative revolution. He'll have many opportunities during the coming weeks as Congress takes up legislation to fix the welfare system, reduce taxes on working families, and put our nation on the path to a balanced budget. But he should know that we will never compromise away the mandate the American people gave us last November. We will fight to the end for fundamental conservative change, or we will take our case to the American people in 1996. This will not be an autumn of compromise. This fall, we will win our fight for revolutionary change vote by vote and bill by bill, and come next fall we will change the occupant of the White House."", 'Ultimately, our differences aren\'t just political, they represent two competing philosophies of government. President Clinton and his top advisors believe that with more taxes, more regulations, more spending, and more mandates, government can replace the individual as the engine that powers America\'s economic growth. They belittle the contributions of the risk-taker, the entrepreneur, the maverick innovator — people willing to risk everything just for the chance to make their dreams real. They insist that the government — not the individual — should control the wealth of our nation, taxing away our money in the belief that Washington can spend it more wisely and invest it more productively. They disparage what they call the ""myth"" of the ""entrepreneurial hero"" — a curious concept in a nation where the entrepreneurial spirit dwells within every one of our citizens.', 'The problem is clear: President Clinton and the Democratic Party today ""distrust the market, preach government as the answer to our problems, and prefer the bureaucrat they know to the consumer they can\'t control."" Those aren\'t my words. They were Bill Bradley\'s words when he announced his retirement from the Senate.', 'For months now, we\'ve watched economists debate the consequences of President Clinton\'s policies: whether the U.S. is falling back into a recession or merely heading for what they call a ""soft landing."" The fact is, this has been one of the weakest economic recoveries the country has seen since the end of World War II. And compared with the Reagan economic expansion during the 1980s, the Clinton economy looks positively anemic.', ""It's worth briefly comparing the two recoveries because they represent such dramatically different economic philosophies. President Reagan cut tax rates across-the-board, reduced government red tape, and encouraged enterprise. President Clinton raised tax rates, unleashed federal regulators, and sent Justice Department lawyers out after innovative, fast-growing companies like Microsoft."", 'The results were predictable. The Reagan economy kept expanding, producing the longest period of sustained peacetime economic growth in U.S. history. But the Clinton economy is slowing dramatically. Economic growth dropped to about 1 percent in the second quarter of this year. Real wages actually fell by 2.3 percent during the year that ended in March 1995 — the worst performance in 8 years. And the Index of Leading Economic Indicators — which predicts future economic conditions — dropped again in July, the fifth decline in six months.', ""The White House is now predicting 2.5 percent growth for the rest of the century. They congratulate themselves because, in their view, 2.5 percent growth represents the outer limit of America's economic potential. In the Clinton Administration's world, America's economy has hit a glass ceiling. We can see greater prosperity. We can watch our competitors achieve it, But we can never attain it ourselves."", 'Our whole history tells us that America can do better. Since World War II, our economy has averaged 3 percent growth. During the Reagan years, we averaged nearly 4 percent growth. Yet, the latest Economic Report of the President dismisses the chances for higher growth without inflation. The authors of the report react to those who believe faster growth is possible the way the Air Force reacts to UFO sightings, saying: ""certainly there is no convincing empirical evidence to support such claims.""', ""What is it about America today that makes President Clinton believe we can't even live up to our past, much less compete with the most dynamic economies in the world? Why does President Clinton think our best days are behind us? Does he distrust the power of millions of people acting freely in the marketplace? Does he question the creativity of our nation's entrepreneurs? Does he doubt the ability of America's workers?"", 'Whatever his thinking, I believe he is profoundly wrong. I believe the only barrier preventing America from reaching her full potential is a failure of leadership ... a failure of vision ... not a failure of our people.', ""Maybe my faith comes from what I've seen from America.

A tax increase here, a subsidy there and everything will come out according to some master plan."", 'Worse yet, they are captives of grim, zero-sum thinking — the dangerous idea that for some Americans to succeed others must fail. The most popular weapon in the Clinton Administration\'s economic policy arsenal is a constant appeal to envy and class warfare. It\'s why they always talk about attacking ""the rich."" Hitting people they feel got a ""free ride"" in the 1980s.', ""The President speaks with great feeling about the need for civility in the political arena. In some cases, I believe the American people expect us to disagree — and disagree passionately. But there is one instance in which he is right: For the good of the country, let's agree to take Medicare out of the realm of politics. When Social Security was in trouble back in the early 1980s, both parties agreed the program was too important for playing politics. So we took Social Security off the political table and worked together to fix it. Medicare is no less important."", ""The President's own Cabinet warns that Medicare will go bankrupt within 7 years unless we fix it. The President himself has proposed sweeping reductions in the growth of Medicare spending. If there is one issue that should rise above partisan politics, it's Medicare. I call on the President today to join me in a commitment to America's seniors: Let's lift Medicare out of the general budget debate and put it on a higher plane so we can work together to save and strengthen this program of vital importance to older Americans."", 'There are many other opportunities to highlight the fundamental differences between our governing philosophies, and economic policy is certainly one. I have a very different view than President Clinton. Mine is based not on a desire to divide America, but on uniting our people and lifting our nation to new and higher levels of greatness. I grew up in a small business town where people pulled together. Small business is the heart and soul of Russell, Kansas. Our ancestors came to the Kansas plains with no guarantees. There were no promises of welfare ... no government assurances at the end of the trail. All they had were dreams pounding in their hearts. Faith in their Maker. The commitment to care for each other. And all they asked was the opportunity a free country offers to all its people - the chance to make the most of their God-given talents and abilities so they could build a better life for themselves and their children.', ""To me, that's America."", ""And that's why economic policy must never be reduced to dry numbers and stale statistics. Because it's a statement about how we view America."", 'If I am elected President it will be on the strength of a program that embodies opportunity and responsibility for our people - one that strives to create an economy which frees the genius of Americans from the heavy hand of government. I am not afraid to make this election a referendum on growth, hope, and opportunity versus stagnation, redistribution, and envy. I am confident we will win the hearts and minds of the people in 1996. Very few Americans believe in penalizing those who make it in this country because so many Americans are determined to make it themselves.', ""If anything stands in the way of realizing our full potential it is not some imaginary barrier beyond which our citizens cease to innovate and produce. No, it's the obsolete economic model which President Clinton is so zealously trying to save from extinction."", ""There's an irony here. The nation's first baby boomer president dedicating his Administration to preserving a Depression-era model of government designed for a world which no longer exists, developed during an Industrial Age economy that is receding into the pages of history before our very eyes."", 'I was a boy when that model took hold. Yet I hope to lead America in a new direction and make way for the promise of a new century.', ""Our greatest obstacle is a federal government that has grown too large, too intrusive, and too bureaucratic. We didn't dig ourselves into a $5 trillion debt because the American people are undertaxed. We got that $5 trillion debt because government overspends. And that's why we must start by reining in the federal government - and returning to the states and to the people the power and responsibility properly reserved to them under the 10th Amendment to the Constitution."", 'The new Republican Congress has already begun this process by passing a budget that will eliminate the federal deficit within seven years. As President, I will continue to downsize the federal government to accelerate our quest for a balanced budget. And I will use the veto pen to eliminate federal pork and insist that government lives by the same discipline as you do in your daily businesses.', 'But our efforts to expand opportunity and encourage economic growth must not stop there. If we are to truly release all the hidden potential of this nation, I believe we must scrap the current tax code and start again from scratch. There are many other elements to a pro-growth economic agenda — such as opening new markets to American products, scaling back government regulations, and pursuing a stable monetary policy. I will be discussing these ideas more specifically throughout my campaign: But dramatic tax reform has to be near the top of the list.', 'The federal tax code was first enacted in 1913 at a time when the Panama Canal was just being finished, Ty Cobb was at the top of his game, and Woodrow Wilson was the new president. Under the original system, most people paid no taxes at all. For those few who did pay, the usual rate was 1%. At that time, no one envisioned tax rates would soar to 70% — as we had until the Reagan years — or even 30%. No one could have imagined that middle and low income workers would someday face such punitive levels of taxation.', ""The problems of today's tax code are clear. With the Clinton surcharges, the top rate now stands at almost 40%. High marginal rates discourage work, reduce the rewards of entrepreneurship, and encourage tax avoidance. Middle class families are forced to work harder and harder just to keep up — their hopes for a better life taxed away by government."", 'The complexity of the code wastes billions of hours in compliance effort and — worst of all — convinces many Americans that the tax system has been hijacked by special interests. Today, there are more people working to comply with or avoid the tax code than serve in the armed forces of the United States. But is President Clinton proposing a tax reform plan? No — instead his Treasury officials are defending the current system, with all its complexities and unfairness.', ""When I announced my candidacy for president, I said I would fight for a lower, fairer, flatter, simpler tax system. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and I have appointed Jack Kemp to head a National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform to determine how we might go about it. I am eager to hear the Commission's recommendations, which will be reported by the end of the year."", ""But today I want to describe in broad terms what I believe must be the essential elements of a sweeping, pro-growth tax reform that will lift America to a far more ambitious long-term growth plan - a path bold enough to secure our position as the world's economic leader well into the next century."", 'First, we need a new tax code that moves us toward a system with lower and flatter rates. During much of the past century, tax policy has been a primary tool with which government has wielded power, fed the bureaucracy, and redistributed wealth. Deleting the whole twisted wreck of federal tax law and starting anew is the surest way I can imagine to deliver real and lasting economic change to the American people.', ""I don't believe Americans support taxation designed to punish success. Any fair system would not penalize, but instead reward people for working harder, investing wisely, and saving more. It would eliminate the lobbyist-drafted loopholes that benefit the few, but force the rest of us to pay."", ""And a fair tax system would relieve the burden on working families. A family of four - earning up to $25,000 to $30,000 per year - should pay little or no federal income tax. A fair system would recognize that a family's most important responsibility is raising its children. It would respect their efforts, instead of penalizing them as the current system does."", ""And a fair system would stop taxing capital twice: first as income and then as capital gains, reducing the return on risk-taking and investment. Today, we have the highest capital gains tax of any major industrialized country. Because the capital gains tax is not indexed, we tax imaginary gains that are due solely to inflation. When it comes to competition with countries like Germany and Japan who hardly tax capital gains at all - we're tying the hands of the most productive, most innovative people in our economy."", 'As a second step, I would end the IRS as we know it. I know a lot of tears will be shed, but Americans will just have to learn to live without it.', 'The IRS was never meant to be such an intrusive, oppressive presence in American life. Its purpose was to collect taxes. Period.

More investigators work for the IRS than the Drug Enforcement Administration - a sure sign that we've got our priorities wrong. The current tax code runs thousands of pages. The instructions for the easiest tax form the government can produce - the EZ form - run to 34 pages of fine print. Compliance costs attributable to the tax code total in the hundreds of billions of dollars every year, and some companies file tax forms thousands of pages long."", ""As former IRS Commissioner Shirley Peterson has pointed out, tax rules have gotten so complex, most Americans don't honestly know whether they've complied with the law. Turns out the IRS doesn't know either. In 1993, 8.5 million Americans who called the IRS Hotline couldn't get the right answers to even the most basic questions."", 'With an infinitely simpler tax system, the 1040 form would go the way of the vacuum tube. Americans could file their tax return on a post-card. And thousands of IRS investigators, accountants, and tax lawyers would be able to utilize their talents in more productive ways.', ""Third, to ensure that Congress doesn't turn a flatter tax system into a political football, we need to pass a Constitutional Amendment requiring a 3/5ths majority vote before Congress can raise income tax rates. This would guard the reforms, bias the system against high tax rates, and generally keep Congress out of your wallets."", 'Entrepreneurs and other agents of economic growth operate on the cutting edge. They fulfill their mission in our economy by being bold, daring, unpredictable. But the role of government is different. It must strive to be predictable ... to create a stable economic environment with clearly defined rules of the road.', 'A 3/5ths Constitutional Amendment would protect taxpayers from the shifting political winds. It would allow business leaders to make decisions based on the opportunities of the market, not the advice of their tax lawyer.', ""What results could we expect from such an agenda - an agenda of lower federal spending and radical tax simplification? I believe we would see an explosion of job creation, investment, and economic growth. Even if the economy just regained its historic level of 3% growth, our nation's GDP would be $410 billion higher by the year 2002. The federal deficit would be about $100 billion lower because of higher tax receipts and lower interest payments."", 'But 3% growth should be a floor, not a ceiling. I am convinced America can do even better.', 'So I have come to Chicago with this message: I believe we must chart a new course leading into a new century. It is long past time to abandon the out-dated economic mindset of the 1930s. And it is the worst time to politicize our markets with policies of envy and division.', 'Instead, we must recommit ourselves to our founding principle of opportunity and freedom for all - the principle which made the American idea an inspiration for all the world. We must place our faith, once again, in the unlimited potential of our people.', 'I believe we have not yet come even close to unleashing the full creativity of America. Before us beckons vast new sources of wealth and new paths to prosperity in a technologically ascendant land. And the pent-up human capital in our inner cities and low income communities is still waiting to be tapped.', ""This is no time for diminished expectations. This is no time to sell America's potential short. This is a time to let go of the 20th Century and embrace the 21st — to seize the promise of the new era by liberating the genius of the American people. Because by putting our faith in freedom and in our people we can build an America as big as our dreams ... as strong as our hearts ... and as great as our history demands."", 'Thank you very much.']"

And as President, I will rescind every one of those acts of federal coercion.', 'In a Dole administration, abortion on demand will no longer be the policy of the federal government. As long as we hold the White House, federal agencies will be in the business of licensing drugs that promote life, not death.

As your President, I will sign an executive order to prohibit federal funding for harmful or destructive experiments on living human embryos.', ""We talk all day about children's issues, as liberals often do. But it will be just that — hollow talk — if we don't have enough love in our hearts to care for the most innocent among us. All our talk about a less violent, more caring society will come to nothing unless we protect the sanctity of human life. Until the day comes when we overturn Roe v. Wade, why can't we require parental consent before a minor obtains an abortion? Why can't we stop partial birth abortions? Why can't we get the government out of the business of promoting abortions? The truth is, we can — and with the right leadership in the White House — we will."", 'The Oval Office should be a place of moral leadership for America. But, for the past three years, it has not been. The policies of the federal government should be rooted in the values embraced by the American people. But our President has advocated policies that undermine these values. The executive orders he signed were just among the first examples.', ""Abortion is not an issue of when life begins. It's a question of when love begins. It's a question of what kind of people we are and aspire to become. A spirit of hope is evident across America — in crisis pregnancy centers, in groups finding homes for children, by churches and synagogues caring for unwed mothers, and by teenagers promoting abstinence.

It's frustrating at times, but it's much better to be the majority leader. The problem is, as some people fail to understand, in the Senate you have to have 60 votes to shut off debate. You can't off debate, you can't pass a bill. We only have 53 Republicans, so obviously we have to reach out to Democrats from time to time, or in the alternative, we just can't pass the bill."", 'MICKELSON: From your point of view, a dream scenario, obviously, would be elected president with a majority in both houses.', 'DOLE: A filibuster-proof majority in the Senate.

Haven't you raised taxes that many times?"", 'And my second question is — Have you ever voted to increase the tax burden on the middle income taxpayer?', ""DOLE: I'd have to go back and check that. You know, I voted against tax increase 60 times. What — let me put this down..."", 'MICKELSON: Sure.', ""DOLE: A lot of those tax increases were closing glaring loopholes where big, big business were getting hundreds of millions of dollars that they shouldn't have gotten and this followed after I pushed through the Congress with President Reagan the biggest tax cut in history in 1981, and we tried to stop the biggest tax increase in history in 1993 — President Clinton's tax increase."", ""But we have closed loopholes from time to time. I don't believe we've raised rates on middle income Americans. The 1990 budget deal included some changes that did indirectly raise rates, but President Bush — it was President Bush's package. I was Republican leader in the Senate."", ""But let's keep one thing clear about Mr. Forbes plan. It's going to add to the deficit — $185 billion according to one study; $210 billion according to another; $173 billion according to another; and it's going to take away your mortgage interest deduction, your charitable deduction, and it's going to shift the burden of taxes from the upper income — Mr. Forbes — to middle income, probably like the caller."", ""MICKELSON: One Steve Forbes's plan accomplishes, the flat tax, accomplishes — one of the things he put in his early campaign ads was he wants to use the tax code to regulate the power of Congress in order to reward certain policies and take away its ability to punish certain policies."", ""He thinks the tax code gives Congress too much power and therefore packs too much power to influence policy. That's one of his ..."", 'DOLE: Right.', 'MICKELSON: ... original — if you want a flatter tax, which of the deductions that we now get would be gone? Or would you remove some of the deductions?', ""DOLE: Oh, you'd probably have to remove a lot of them. But you'd have to — that's why I think we ought to have hearings. Just to come out with some edict — this is going to be the tax plan — is an indication that somebody doesn't know much about how it works. I mean you've got to go through the Congress. You can't be, in effect, a dictator if you're president of the United States, say this is it, this is my tax plan."", 'MICKELSON: Yes.', ""DOLE: And you're going to find that people in Iowa and California and New York want to come in and testify. Maybe they're farmers, maybe they're businessmen or women or maybe something else. Maybe they're realtors — they'd like to keep the mortgage interest deduction. Maybe they got a sales tax in New York they don't want to give up."", ""So, we've got to hear all these disparate voices out there and then put something together. That's how democracy works. That's how the process works, and I'm just suggesting, we'd be happy to hear his plan or anybody else's plan."", ""We started on the Kemp plan and Jack Kemp's known to be pretty much of a supply side Republican, interested in lower taxes, probably like to have a flat tax, but he also knows in the real world, you're going to have certain deductions kept and certain exemptions, so..."", ""MICKELSON: The deduction that you'd fight for would be the mortgage interest deduction?"", ""DOLE: Yeah, I — you know, Speaker Gingrich said it's not going to happen without a mortgage interest deduction. It's probably not going to happen without charitable. Then you've got big states like New York — you have state and local sales tax. They've got a lot of power in Congress. You've got a lot of members — Democrats and Republicans — who are going to line up and say: Wait a minute. You're not going to let us lose that deduction, so I think it's an indication, you know, that you need somebody with experience as president of the United States, somebody who would recognize at the outset that it's not quite that easy. It doesn't happen that way. That's the difference."", 'MICKELSON: Everybody says you have a lock on Iowa.', ""DOLE: I don't have a lock on anything."", 'MICKELSON: For first place.', 'DOLE: No.', ""MICKELSON: You're a shoe-in here.

I don't come out here just at election time. I've been coming out here for 25 years and met a lot of nice people, and my wife's been a great asset. Elizabeth's done a great job. My daughter Robin's been out here, so it's been a family effort, but I — you know, I'll leave it up to the people of Iowa."", ""I hope to carry — I hope to win tonight, but I'm not going to be overconfident."", 'MICKELSON: The next step would be therefore the rest of the country. How will you approach other issues outside of the heartland?', ""DOLE: They're going to be the — I don't have one message for Iowa and a different message — I think that's how some politicians get tripped up. They try to tailor their message depending where they are. I've been around. I've got a paper trail, so to say. I've got a voting record. It's a mainstream conservative voting record."", 'I want to have English as the official language in America, have been voting that way for a long time, voluntary prayer in schools, pro-life...', ""MICKELSON: And we're at the end of our conversation with Senator Bob Dole as we're rejoining our radio audience, and we were talking about the other issues that are important to you."", 'In the closing minute, what do you want us to know about Bob Dole and this race?', ""DOLE: I think if I could just make it in the closing minute is that, you know, it all comes down — this is a very important election, a very important caucus tonight. The people of Iowa could tell decide the future of this country. You've got to think of it that way. That's how important this is."", ""And I think and I believe what they'll end up doing is to find someone, look at all of us very closely, scrutinize us, look at our records, and come down with some mainstream conservative with a lot of experience, somebody's who's made tough decisions."", ""I've been the leader of the Senate 11 years.

Thank you very much.', ""Two hundred and eight years ago, the people of this state rendered another verdict with a profound effect on America's future. On June 21, 1788, a New Hampshire convention ratified the Constitution of the United States, providing the necessary approval of three-quarters of the states."", 'The vote to ratify the Constitution was important, but so was the list of amendments New Hampshire attached to it. The first was, and I quote: ""That it be explicitly declared that all Powers not expressly and particularly delegated by the aforesaid Constitution are reserved to the several States to be by them exercised."" It became the 10th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.', 'Prompted by New Hampshire, our founders intended that we should reserve power for the states because we should place our faith in the people. More than the secret of our success, this philosophy is the secret of freedom. And it is a central purpose of my campaign for the Presidency.', 'I am running for President because I believe we have reached a defining moment in our national history. For too long we have drifted away from the values and philosophy that shaped America. The choices we make this year will determine tile character of our nation, and the future of our children long into the next century.', 'Look at the world we live in. Exploding all around us is a great, global revolution. Regime after oppressive regime has fallen as freedom replaces tyranny. People everywhere are rising up to claim their God-given rights to individual liberty, as we did more than 200 years ago. Today the light of hope and freedom is shining in places where we thought despair and darkness would always reign.', 'Yet there is also a great paradox. This new world of freedom depends on the restraint and inspiration found in time-tested values. Only men and women of character can make freedom work. And only a government controlled by the people can reflect the people s virtues. As we close this century and prepare to enter the next, that is the challenge of America. That is why I have come to New Hampshire, today.', 'Another truth is that American parents have never been more worried about their children. There once was a time when parents believed there was a community of adults working together to raise the next generation. But no longer. Today parents feel their family and their values are under attack from almost every direction, including our schools.', 'In New Hampshire students are learning well. But a national study, just a little more than a year ago, revealed that a staggering 40 percent of all fourth graders were reading at below grade level. Twenty-five percent of high school seniors were functionally illiterate. Now those seniors are in college, or in the job market.', ""These scores are discouraging. And we must ask ourselves, after the billions of dollars we have poured into education, how can this be? We must answer with the truth, which is that a liberal education bureaucracy has hijacked our schools, using them to pass on liberal ideas we either don't share or don't think should get in the way of reading, writing and arithmetic."", 'One recent education fad is called ""outcome-based education,"" Unfortunately, too often the outcomes that count are not facts learned, but attitudes achieved. ""Willingness to cooperate"" and ""appreciation of diversity"" are two such attitudes. According to some, to correct a kid\'s spelling risks dampening his ""self-esteem"", so we should let him be ""creative"", although wrong, instead, But in America, mastery of the language is a key to success.', ""That's why I believe our educational reforms start with this simple principle: we want our kids to speak English, to read English and to able to spell in proper, American English."", 'And let\'s speak the truth for a moment about crime in America. It\'s true that violent crime is down slightly from historically high levels. But is also true that we could soon be faced with a new wave of violent crime, unleashed by what Professor John DiIulio of Princeton calls ""Super Predators"" — young criminals who are totally merciless ... capable of committing the most vicious of acts for the most trivial reasons: a pair of sneakers A football jersey. A misplaced glance mistaken for disrespect.', 'This prediction, which has already begun to come true, is a great source of sadness for us. But our sadness must be matched with resolve, One of the remedies — just one, but an important one — is to shift the focus of the juvenile justice system, as you have done in New Hampshire. Teenage thugs must come to understand that every act of violence will have a consequence. And the consequence is called imprisonment.', 'Teenagers who commit violent crimes should be prosecuted as adults and should receive sentences commensurate to the danger they represent to society.', 'Which brings me to the second attribute America needs to find in her leaders: hope.', ""Hope is at the heart of the American character. We believe it's always possible to make tomorrow better than today, to make our children's lives better than our own. But if there is one question that draws a bright line of principle most sharply in our public life, it is this: where do you find your hope?"", 'Love of God and country and family. Commitment to honesty, decency and personal responsibility. Self-reliance tempered by a sense of community. A willingness to sacrifice born from a boundless confidence in the future. These are the values of the American people, and I believe they are what made us the greatest nation on earth They are the values I grew up with, as did so many of you.', ""I also believe that America's troubles today are due, in large part, to the erosion of those values by our culture, our government and our institutions. And I believe that the secret to getting our country back on track is to return to them as a matter of national policy."", 'If America yearns for moral leadership, it is not to correct a fault in the American people, but to stop our government and our culture from creating fault lines in our society. Truth and hope are moral attributes America needs right now in her leaders. And each of us must do all in our power to provide them.', 'Let me start with truth, because we need some fixed points of fact to help chart our course.', 'It is true that ""the era of big government is over."" But it is also true that the structure of big government remains largely in place. It is still so large that it takes an average family 120 days of work each year to support it. It still closes the doors of business with endless regulations and countless mandates. And it still betrays the poor with a welfare system whose failure is evident in the shame of our slums, the violence of our streets and the decline of our families.', 'In a year of heroic effort, we in the Congress made our first assault on the citadel of big government. As one of our first acts, we followed the New Hampshire model and we passed a bill to end unfunded mandates. We passed tax relief for our families and a Medicare rescue plan for our elderly. Like you in New Hampshire, we passed welfare reform that elevates the values of family and work, and trusts the states to do a better job of taking care of their own people. And, perhaps most importantly, we passed a balanced budget — a historic document that kept our promise to the next generation. It is the most extraordinary series of legislative accomplishments in my memory. And I will always be proud of my part in it.', ""But we are talking about truth, and the sad truth is this: as the year closed America's government was still sorrily the same. We were defeated time after time by Presidential vetoes."", ""It is also true, as some have said, that our economy is the strongest it's been in 30 years. The stock market is at an all-time high. And the bond market just finished another spectacular year. But the real average hourly wage is 5 percent lower than it was a decade ago. Two years ago, family earnings were hit with the largest tax increase in history. Corporate profits are setting records, but so are corporate layoffs. And middle class families feel less and less secure about the future. There is a wide and growing gap between what the government's statistics say about our economy and how American families feel about it."", 'A balanced budget would have lowered the interest rates families pay on homes, cars and student loans. Balancing the budget would also free capital to create more and better paying jobs, That is why we will continue to fight for a balanced budget with real tax relief to help working families in New Hampshire and throughout our nation.', ""It's clear how too many in power today answer that question. Every good intention is followed by a mandate. The source of every social III is an imperfection in the people. The solution to every national challenge is another federal program. For too many, the focus of hope is found in Washington. More government, bigger government, more meddlesome government."", 'I have a different philosophy and, I believe, so do you. We believe our problems come not from too little government, but too much. The solution is to put more of our trust in the wisdom and goodness of the American people.', ""That's why government should support families, not pull them apart with a welfare program that drives fathers away. We should lighten the burden on families, not weigh them down with punishing taxes. We should put parents back in charge of our schools. and we must, each of us, use the bully pulpit of public office, as well as he private moments of a parent — to challenge a culture that undermines the lessons we are trying to teach our children."", 'And, as New Hampshire knew more than 200 years ago, we must find hope in the genius of the states. We will find in this body, and in others like it across America, our greatest hope for reforming welfare, fixing our schools and protecting our people from crime. In fact, all our hopes are united by one conviction: that we must return power to where it comes from and where it belongs: to families and communities, to states and to citizens.', ""When I left New Hampshire eight years ago, I did not think I would be back again as a Presidential candidate. But, like many Americans, I became concerned that America was heading, down the wrong path. Taxes were being raised. The wasn't being balanced. And government experts were trying to take control over our health, our economy and our lives. Our national interests were taking a back seat to the whims of the United Nations, and our young men and women in uniform were taking orders from Boutros-Boutros Ghail."", 'Then, during the 50th anniversary of D-Day, D returned to the hills of Italy I had climbed so many years before as a soldier in the 10th Mountain Division. Standing in those Italian hills I thought about the America of our youth --- the America we risked our lives to protect ... and about our hopes for the generations who would follow.', 'Then I thought about the America we live in today — an America still great and still the beacon of freedom around the world, but an America whose problems seem to grow deeper and deeper every year. And I thought that perhaps there was one more mission for my generation ... one more call to serve.', 'I believe my generation might have something the country needs right now: someone who knows what made America great in the first place. Someone who knows what has been sacrificed to keep us free. Someone who would do all in his power to lead America back to her place in the sun. Someone who knows the way.', 'This great country was built by men and women who sacrificed to build a better future for those of us who came after. Now we have to do our part, in this time, in this generation, to make America a better place for our children. We can draw our strength, as we always have, from the as we always have, from the truth, and from the bottomless reservoir of hope and work and courage that is our heritage.

But the facts leave no doubt that they are also the worst of times for many who live and work on Main Street, America.', 'Fact: From January 1995 to January 1996, 258,000 high-paying manufacturing job disappeared from the American economy.', 'Fact: In 1994 and 1995--a time when the economy was growing--American productivity rose by 2%, yet wages fell by more than 2%. In other words, Americans were working more and earning less.', ""Fact: Average hourly real wages are now 5% lower than they were a decade ago and they haven't increased one cent since President Clinton took office."", 'Fact: The overall American trade deficit is now nearly $163 billion--an all-time high, and jobs and wages are being lost because of it.', 'Those are the facts, and behind each of these facts are real people.', 'People like a father of four who lost his job and is struggling to make ends meet.', 'A mother of two who is worried her job may be next.', 'A man nearing the end of his career, who worries about losing his health insurance.', 'Countless mothers and fathers who are convinced that their sons and daughters will have a lower standard of living than the one they have now.', ""These are the Americans who for years have paid their taxes, played by the rules, and who have made sure that America's future was always better than her past."", ""This election is about many things, but most of all it's about these Americans. And it's about the future of our children."", ""For all of his talk about change, President Clinton's actions of the past three years have made clear his vision of the future: More government, more mandates, more rules, more regulations, more spending, and more taxes."", ""The fact is that more government will not create more jobs. More government will not lead to more ingenuity and innovation. More government will not give America's middle income families the pay increase they deserve."", 'But more freedom will.', 'And from my first day as President, the definition of ""Dolenomics"" will be a policy that is dedicated to giving all Americans what I call the ""Four Freedoms of Economic Security"":', 'These four freedoms are Freedom from Deficits; Freedom from Unreasonable Taxation; Freedom From Excessive Regulations; and the Freedom to compete in a Fair Marketplace.', 'Let me briefly touch upon each of these four freedoms.', 'There has been a great deal of debate about a balanced budget, but there has been no debate over the benefits a balanced budget would bring: More jobs and more opportunity for all Americans--as well as more money in the pockets of American families.', 'The Washington Post reported that the Republican plan to balance the budget over the next seven years would save the government $60 billion in interest payments every year. And those savings could translate into a $500 a year tax cut for every household.', 'Additionally, balancing the budget will also lead to a reduction of the interest rates Americans pay on loans, and put more money in the pocketbooks of American families.', 'For example, if you are paying an average thirty year adjustable rate home mortgage, a balanced budget would mean you could save nearly $1,250 a year.', 'If you took out a $15,000 loan to buy a new car, you would save $1,000 in interest payments over the life of the loan.', 'A balanced budget would result in over $2,000 in reduced interest payments over the life of a 10-year $11,000 college loan.', ""And a balanced budget would also lead to something on which we can't put a price: And that's a brighter future for our children and our children's children, who are in danger of losing the American dream to the American debt."", 'As Senate Majority Leader, I have produced the first balanced budget plan in a generation. As President, I will sign such a plan into law. I will insist that Congress send a Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment to the states. And I will lead a nationwide effort to ensure that the amendment is ratified, and that it becomes part of our Constitution.', 'The second Freedom of Economic Security is freedom from unreasonable taxation.', 'If you go to any Main Street in America, and ask for a show of hands on who thinks our tax system is fine just as it is, not one hand will go up.', 'But if you go to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, you will get a different reaction. For three years, President Clinton has not proposed any dramatic changes in the tax code--with the exception of the largest tax increase in history.', 'And with the surcharges that were included in that tax increase, the top federal tax rate now stands at almost 40%. Add in state and local taxes in some locations, and the Social Security tax, and many Americans are paying tax rates of over 50%.', 'America fought a revolution fueled by the belief that ""taxation without representation is tyranny."" Over two centuries later, we have every reason to believe that taxation with representation isn\'t much better.', 'The complexity of the tax law forces Americans to waste billions of hours trying to comply with endless regulations and red tape, and worst of all--it convinces many Americans that the tax system has been hijacked by special interests.', 'Deleting the whole twisted wreck of federal tax law and starting anew is the surest way I can imagine to deliver real and lasting economic change to the American people.', 'Let me state it as clearly as I can; as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I delivered the largest tax cut in history for President Ronald Reagan.', 'And whet I sit in the Oval Office, I will deliver to the American people the most dramatic tax reform in history.', 'In place of our present tax system, I would provide the leadership needed to replace it with one that is fairer, flatter, and simpler ... One that rewards people for working hard, taking risks, and saving more.', ""I believe a family of four that is struggling just to make ends meet should pay little or no federal income tax. And I would create a system that would recognize that a family's most important responsibility is raising its children. It would respect their efforts in this regard, instead of penalizing them, as the current system does."", 'In designing a new tax system I will ensure that we do not increase the tax burden on the middle-class. Many of the flat tax and other reform proposals being considered sound great, but we must look to the detail and determine whether they will actually hurt or help the middle-class.', ""And make no mistake about it, the fairer tax system I envision would cut capital gains tax rates. Today, we have the highest capital gains tax of any major industrialized country. When it comes to competition with countries like Germany and Japan--who hardly tax capital gains at all--we're tying the hands of some of the most productive, most innovative people in our economy."", ""And while I'm at it, I would also sign legislation that would end the IRS as we know it. Today, the IRS employs more than a 100,000 people at a cost of nearly $7 billion per year."", 'With an infinitely simpler tax system, the 1040 form would go the way of the Berlin Wall, Americans could file their tax returns on a post-card. And thousands of IRS agents, accountants, and tax lawyers would be able to utilize their talents in more productive ways.', ""And to ensure that Congress doesn't turn a flatter tax system into a political football, I would insist that Congress pass a constitutional amendment requiring a 3/5ths majority vote before congress can raise income tax rates. This would guard the reforms and generally keep Washington out of your wallets."", 'The third Freedom of Economic Security is freedom from excessive regulation.', ""It's worth noting that the Lord's Prayer contains 57 words. Lincoln's Gettysburg Address has 266 words. The Ten Commandments are presented in just 297 words. The Declaration of Independence has only 300 words. And federal regulatory statutes and rules now total about 100 million words."", 'And, according to estimates by the National Association of Manufacturers, these 100 million words now cost a typical family nearly $6,000 a year, and they cost our economy $581 billion a year.', 'Our regulatory system has become an instruction manual. It tells local governments and businesses exactly what to do and how to do it. Detailed rule after detailed rule addresses every situation that lawmakers and bureaucrats can think of. We have left no room for individual responsibility, and no room for common sense.', 'As Senate Majority Leader, I have fought for the most sweeping regulatory reform legislation in history. But President Clinton has stood in the way.', 'As President, I would direct every Department and every agency--and there would be a lot fewer of them in a Dole Administration--to ask a few questions before any new regulations are imposed on individuals and business.', 'Questions like: Is there a need for this regulation? Do the costs outweigh the benefits? And, does this regulation make common sense? I fully expect that a large number of regulations would flunk this test.', 'The fourth and final Freedom of Economic Security is the freedom to compete in a free and fair international market.', 'The bottom line is that mammoth trade deficits siphon off our hard-earned wealth, and give it to other countries.', 'As President, I would ensure that America keeps her wealth, and the jobs that go with it, here at home.', ""We do not need to hunker down behind a wall around our country, however, as some have suggested. Protectionism and isolation are not the answer to competing against other thriving, successful economies in the world market. If our economy is to grow, then we must compete. We can't hide."", ""Others say we should leave the trade deficit alone, that it will take care of itself. This, too, is wrong. The trade deficit will not fix itself. It will take firm and decisive leadership. It will take a President who will aggressively fight for America's right to compete everywhere in the world."", 'A Dole Administration will quickly declare an end to the Clinton trade policy of ""surrender and sign on the dotted line."" President Clinton says he has signed a record number of trade agreements with foreign countries. What has this blizzard of paper achieved? Markets remain closed to many U.S. products and services, and we are losing more jobs than ever.', 'President Clinton threatened a trade war with Japan then hoisted the white flag. So now we have trading partners who refuse even to negotiate with us, so complete has been the collapse of U.S. credibility. Increasingly belligerent trading partners realize that the Clinton Administration will not use against them the market-opening tools Congress created.', 'The price for this policy is paid by American workers. It is their jobs that are at risk from unfairly-traded goods from abroad. It is their jobs that slip away as more and more companies find it difficult to withstand the assault.', 'The damaging drift must stop. And in a Dole Administration it would. Our trading partners would be put on notice: No more trade deals that are never lived up to. No more toleration of unfair trade barriers.', 'I will stand up for America when unfairly-traded goods undermine American jobs. I will vigorously defend American jobs and American workers against the relentless attack of unfair trade practices by other countries. I will use the tools that Congress has created to fight for U.S. trade interests in every country around the globe.', ""As I said, this election is more than a choice between candidates; it's a choice about what type of future we will create for our country and our children."", 'We can choose to leave our country and our children with an unrepayable deficit that stifles progress, growth, and jobs. Or we can choose to set a course for a balanced budget and free America from a tidal wave of red ink.', 'We can choose to leave our country and our children with a system that is excessive in the amount of money it requires of most working Americans, and the amount of confusion it imposes on our lives. Or we create a tax system that is lower, fairer, flatter, and much, much, simpler.', 'We can choose to leave our country and our children with a regulatory nightmare that stifles ingenuity and job creation, and that is completely devoid of common sense. Or we can operate on the premise that Americans can be trusted to do the right thing without Washington, D.C. telling us what to do.', 'We can choose to leave our country with a trade system that exports jobs rather than products. Or we can put our trade partners on notice that free trade means their free ride is over.', 'My friends, in each case, the choice is clear. We must choose the future rather than the past. We must free America from deficits. We must free America from unreasonable taxation. We must free America from excessive regulation. And we must insist on the freedom to compete in a fair international marketplace.', 'By fighting for these four freedoms of economic security, we will put our economy back on track, and we will put Americans back to work.']"

I didn't get hot coffee every night and clean sheets. We had to walk. We were all in the infantry."", ""This is a great experience and I really, it's one of the great war ships in American history, and we had a chance to take a little tour and reflect about some of the great heroes who served on this ship, Americans who could have been here today but they gave their life for their country. They loved liberty and freedom as much as anybody here and they made the supreme sacrifice for the greatest country on the face of the Earth, the United States of America. That's what it's about."", '[applause]', ""A great American came down here with me today and he's going to, after I speak, he's going to sort of wrap it up in 30 seconds, Senator Strom Thurmond, one of America's great patriots."", '[applause]', 'And we have the mayor of Mount Pleasant, thank you very much for being here.', '[applause]', 'And my Dole for President chairman and my good friend Tommy Hartnett, and our state chairman right back here with his family.', '[applause]', ""I won't take a lot of your time but I do want to, first of all, recognize the importance of the primary in South Carolina on Saturday. I remember in 1988 when I was running for president, Lee Atwater used to talk about the fire wall, the fire wall in South Carolina, that if Bob Dole should win Iowa and New Hampshire he would meet a fire wall in South Carolina, and he was right. I never got to meet it because I lost in New Hampshire, but I knew it was here."", '[laughter]', 'And I read a lot about it. And I respected Lee Atwater and the other great people in this state who were supporting vice President Bush. And he went on to become a great president and I supported him in the United States Senate as his Republican leader and very proud to have done that.', ""And now we're in another time and the issues haven't changed that much. They're about the economy, they're about jobs, they're about crime, they're about healthcare. The issues never seem to change a great deal."", ""DOLE: But now, we're also talking in the Republican Party about the heart and soul of our party, about the heart and soul of the Republican Party — a party that we fought to build."", 'And I can remember the Republican Party in this state not too many years ago. We had had the meeting right up here on the platform. But things have changed, and now the Republican Party is the majority party in the great state of South Carolina for the right reasons - because we have good people.', '[applause]', ""And many Democrats have come to the Republican Party in South Carolina. My parents were Democrats, so I can say with pride they're the best people I ever knew. And so, I know there are a lot of good Democrats in the audience today, and maybe some Independents, and a lot of Republicans, and maybe one or two just came to the wrong meeting — whatever. I don't know what happens, but ..."", '[laughter]', ""This election is about building the Republican Party. This election is about becoming the majority party for the right reason - because we have the ideas, because we have the vision, because we attract people all over America. Everybody's welcome in the Republican Party."", ""That's what's so great about our party. We want people to belong to the Republican Party."", '[applause]', ""And we want to appeal to the hopes and aspirations of people, and not play on their fears. And there's no doubt about it — selecting a nominee in the Republican Party is serious business. When I had a chance to shake hands with these young cadets here, it's serious business to them who their commander-in-chief is."", ""It's serious business to other young men and women in uniform in America and those of us who've been in uniform because some day, somebody may have to make a decision that might involve their lives, or threaten their lives, or actually take their lives in the defense of liberty and freedom in America."", ""So this is deadly serious business. This is not a game. it is not a popularity contest. we're not electing a talk show host. We're electing a president of the United States. This is very serious business."", '[applause]', ""If you need any recent example, just look what happened in Cuba when the planes were shot down, President Clinton's been fumbling around ever since, trying to figure out what to do."", ""First, he coddled up to Castro over the last two years. He eased all the restrictions, did a lot of things to make Castro feel good. And then Castro did what he did today, and I guess there's a transcript, I understand, now available, showing that they knew they were shooting down unarmed planes."", ""These are American citizens who were shot down and are lost at sea. These are Americans, Mr. President. What are you going to do about it? You ought to tighten the screws on Castro. That's what you ought to do about it. You ought to tighten the trade embargo."", '[applause]', ""And you ought to shut off investment in Cuba. Because if you shut off investment in Cuba, Castro's going to be gone before you know it. Investment's keeping him alive, keeping that Communist dictatorship alive — the last one in this hemisphere. And we're supporting it."", ""DOLE: So I would hope the President will take action on the Dole-Helms-Burton bill which may be up this week in Congress, which would permit us to tighten the embargo, to start dealing and making way for a Democratic government in Cuba. Because people in Cuba love liberty and freedom as much as we do and they're tired of living under the tyranny of a dictator named Fidel Castro, enough is enough is enough."", '[applause]', ""So I'm very excited about this race. I've very proud to be a Republican candidate. I've very proud to be here this afternoon in your presence. I'm very proud to stand here and say that I have experience. Some people say, oh you shouldn't say that, that makes you an insider, well, I'm proud of my experience. I'm proud of my experience serving the Congress of the United States."", '[applause]', ""I didn't get into public office to make money. I got into public office — like a lot of people in the audience — that thought I could make a difference, thought I might do something right that might help somebody along the way, maybe some veteran, maybe some widow, somebody who needed help in America, maybe try and strengthen the economy, maybe trying to cut taxes so we can create more jobs and more opportunities for people, maybe welfare reform; all these things that ought to happen."", '[applause]', ""When Bill Clinton came into office, I was the Republican leader of the Senate and I had many opportunities — I didn't do it purposefully but I had to stand up for the American people and when he passed the largest tax increase in the history of the world, not just America, not a single Republican voted for it. You ought to be proud of that. Not a single Republican voted for a tax increase."", '[applause]', 'And when he said we ought to have a nationalized health care plan, turn it over to the government, we stopped it dead in its tracks when 40 Republican Senators signed up.', '[applause]', ""AS I see it, there,s only one problem in Washington now and it's in the White House. And we want to send Bill Clinton back to Little Rock and it's all going to start right here in South Carolina on Saturday."", '[applause]', ""But ask, Bob why are you running for president? What is your vision for America? And these are all very good questions and you ought to know the answers. I know that America's headed in the wrong direction. I know we're not taking care of our children. I know there's too much crime and there's too much drugs and there's too many young people graduating from high school who can't find California on the map. We've got major problems in America. That's my vision for America."", '[applause]', 'And my vision is no different than yours. We have an obligation, my generation and your generation and other generations that leave America a better place than we found it for our children and our grandchildren.', ""DOLE: That's always been our obligation. my parents — I've had it better than my parents. They had it better than their parents. And on and on it goes."", ""But we're not going to do that unless we make some fundamental changes. As Governor Campbell and Governor Beasley indicated, we got to make fundamental changes in policy. We got to get more money back to families with children. what about a $500.00 tax credit per child. That's $2000.00 for Charlie up here. He's got four children - $2000.00."", '[applause]', ""And I'll bet he can spend it a lot better on his kids than some bureaucrat in Washington, D.C. There's no doubt in my mind that he can do a better job."", '[applause]', ""And we gave President Clinton a chance to sign that bill and he vetoed it. We sent him the first balanced budget in a generation and he vetoed it. We sent him welfare reform to send power back to the states, back to South Carolina where you can make decisions and take better care of the people who need welfare in the process. And he vetoed it. Veto, veto, veto, veto — and in November of 1996 we're going to veto Bill Clinton. Make no mistake about it."", '[applause]', 'And I heard him say — and I\'ve heard the President say publicly: ""You know I never knew it was going to be this way back here. well I knew it was going to be this way."" And he hasn\'t got much longer to worry about.', '[laughter]', ""Not much longer. And we're going to take this campaign to the people. Once we have the nomination, I am going to be the Republican nominee. Make no mistake about it. Bob Dole is going to be the Republican nominee."", '[applause]', ""I ask Jack Kemp — speaking of when I asked Jack Kemp — and Carroll Campbell was on the Commission too — Economic Growth and Tax Reform. They made the report about 6 - 8 weeks ago. We're looking at a single rate. We're looking at a single rate but we're also say, we want to keep it flexible because a lot of Americans — I bet a lot of people in this audience — about the only thing, the only tax break they have is your mortgage interest deduction. And we want to keep that. We think that's important. Keep the mortgage interest deduction."", '[applause]', ""And a lot of people like to make charitable contributions. Let's just pick out one organization. Well, let's say the Red Cross for example. Maybe you want to contribute to the Red Cross, or maybe you borrow money to keep your business open or your farm. You know out in our part of the country farmers live from crop to crop. It's called operating interest."", ""So we've go to make a decision. We're going to do that. But in the end, the one thing we will not do in a Dole administration is to shift the burden from the upper income to the middle income people in this room. we're not going to shift the tax burden to you from upper income. we're going to ask them to be fair, pay their fair share too. And one other thing, when we have a flatter and simpler and fairer tax, we can reduce the IRS. And nobody's going to complain about that. Reduce the number of people in the IRS."", '[applause]', ""DOLE: They won't need $7 billion a year to run the IRS. They won't need 100,000 employees, twice as many as we have in the CIA and five — or twice as many in the FBI, five times as many in CIA, and we spend more in the IRS than we spend for all the drug enforcement programs in America per year. We can save some money there. And I don't think anybody here would lose any sleep over it if we did. So, you'd probably even gain a little sleep."", ""Let me mention one other thing. Nobody talks about it much, but it's very important: There are three branches of government. There's the executive, there's the legislative and then there's the judicial branch. And when Bob Dole is President of the United States, I will appoint conservative judges to the District Court, the Appellate Court and the Supreme Court."", '[applause]', ""They can have more impact — they can have more impact on your lives, on your business, on your future than Congress ever will have in some cases. Now, if they want to be activists, judicial activists, they can run for Congress. They don't need to be on the bench, on the District Court or the Appellate Court or the Supreme Court. And that's a pledge I make to you today: we're going to have conservative judges who are going to strictly construe the Constitution of the United States. That's what they're supposed to do in the first place and some of them forgot that along the way. But they won't forget it in a Dole administration, or they won't be accommodated."", '[applause]', 'I carry around in my pocket a little copy of this amendment. It\'s only 28 words in length. It\'s the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, and I hadn\'t read it for a long time. And I dusted it off about a year ago and it made a lot of sense to me and I heard other people talking about the 10th Amendment. I said, well, what does that really means? So I want to read it to you. It says, ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people.""', ""Now, what does that mean? Well, it means this: If the Constitution doesn't give the federal government that power, and if the Constitution doesn't deny the states that power, then all that power is reserved to the states and to the people. And why did our founding fathers do that? This isn't something that Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole thought up; it's been around over 200 years. And why did they do this? Because they were concerned about an all-powerful federal government that would strip away your rights and take away the rights of the states. That's why this is in the Constitution of the United States and we want to start shifting more power back to the states and back to the people of South Carolina and Kansas and all across America. That is fundamental change, and that's going to happen."", '[applause]', ""So, again, I'm very proud to be here. Another thing: If I go to the White House, we're going to have a North Carolinian go with me named Elizabeth, and she does a great job ..."", '[applause]', ""... and I know you'll be proud of her."", ""DOLE: But I wanted to conclude sort of where I started. I walked in, I shook hands with all these bright young men here. I saw a lot of young people. Saw Charlie's kids up here and that's really what it's all about. You boil it all down. You get all the talk and all the speeches and all the rhetoric and all the TV ads."", ""It's about the future. And you've got to make a judgment, because I said, this is serious business. You've got to ask yourself sometime between now and Saturday — and don't forget it's Saturday."", '[laughter]', ""And if you're on our side, we'll give you a ride; if not, call the local taxi, but in any event ..."", '[laughter]', ""You've got to decide in your own mind: who do I want standing up for me? who do I want standing there when they're talking about foreign policy, or maybe some conflict somewhere that might involve somebody in my family? Who do I want standing there speaking for me in South Carolina when we're talking about tax policy or health care or trade policy, protecting American workers, protecting textile workers, as we should, and as any president would do, other than President Clinton? He can do it right now."", ""Who do I want making decisions that affect family values and speaking out for my family and honesty and decency and integrity and character, and loving your God and loving your church and loving your community? What's wrong with those basic values in America? Nothing is wrong with those values and they're the most important thing we have."", '[applause]', ""I had a meeting on Sunday with Barry Goldwater, remember Barry Goldwater? We're out in..."", '[applause]', ""He issued a statement saying Bob Dole is the real conservative in this race. He's a conservative like Ronald Reagan and Barry Goldwater. He's in that tradition. And I thanked him very much. And I just say to this group: If you're looking for a mainstream conservative, but not somebody who's going to take you over the edge. I want to bring people together."", ""I've been one of the — I think we live in one America. It's not a young America; it's not an old America. It's not black; it's not white; it's not anything. It's America. We live in one America: The United States of America."", '[applause]', ""And our best days are still ahead of us. I'm very optimistic; have been all my life. I've been an optimist. And sometimes you're tested and tested and tested like somebody up there is testing you. But you don't give up, you don't give up, you don't give up. And it's happened to all of us. We've all been tested in one way or the other. There's always something out there, maybe in the way."", ""But I think it's all going to start changing here very soon. And you're going to be a part of it and I'm very, very grateful. I want at this time to ask my colleague, Senator Strom Thurmond to come up and wrap up this session. He does hold the record. He spoke once for 24 hours and 18 minutes without stopping. So, we didn't put him on first, but, you know, that's ..."", '[laughter]', '[applause]', 'Senator Thurmond, come on up.

Not all the Republican-appointed judges are perfect, and not all the Democrat appointed judges are bad. Don't want to make that point at all. I'm just talking about the judiciary.

It's no secret where I stand. I've said it before and I will say it to you now. I will appoint justices to the Supreme Court who"", ""know how to read and respect the clear language of the Constitution as it is written — as it is written — and don't search to find rationalizations for their liberal agenda in so-called emanations and penumbras never intended or imagined by our founding fathers."", 'I will appoint judges who respect the rule of law, who understand society is not to blame for crime, criminals are — judges who protect the rights of crime victims, not invent ever newer and more expansive rights for criminal defendants.', ""In fact, I recently visited a state prison in California, where 400-and-some inmates are on death row. I don't want to get into the death penalty question.

And it seems to me there has to be an end sometime."", 'And Dole judges will hand down strict sentences to criminals in order to protect law-abiding citizens from further violence and harm. And I find it shameful that law-abiding Americans are often locked behind bars — go to any city in America — the security bars on the windows of their homes, while criminals are left free to roam the streets.', ""Now President Clinton may talk the same language as I do on many of these issues. I know he does. But as I'm sorry to say, on so many things, his actions profoundly depart from the meaning of his words. And many of the judges Mr. Clinton has appointed to the federal bench are precisely the ones who are dismantling those guard rails that protect society from the predatory, the violent and the anti-social elements in our midst."", 'His appointees to the Supreme Court have been among the most willing to use technicalities to overturn death sentences for brutal murders. They frequently vote to grant last-minute stays of execution, even when the death row inmates claims are plainly frivolous.', ""And a startling number of Mr. Clinton's lower court judges have demonstrated an outright hostility to law enforcement."", 'WEBWIRE-', 'DOLE: You\'ve all heard about, and you\'ve probably written about, he infamous decision of Judge Harold Baer in New York, who found that it was perfectly reasonable for a man to run from police because he said, residents in the area regard law enforcement as ""corrupt.""', 'He added that he would have been suspicious, quote, ""had the men not run when the cops began to stare at them."" Now, based on this, quote, ""reasoning,"" and I put the word in quotation marks, Judge Baer suppressed the physical evidence the police found — 75 pounds of cocaine and four pounds of heroin — $4 million dollars worth of poisonous drugs.', ""He even suppressed the defendant's voluntary confession. Of course, as you know, Judge Baer's decision received some notoriety. And he even reversed his decision when the criticism mounted, finally coming from an embarrassed White House itself. But the appalling fact is Judge Baer is hardly an exception among some of President Clinton's judicial appointees."", ""Let me give you a few more examples from Bill Clinton's judicial hall of shame. Take the case of Clinton appointee Judge Leonie Brinkema of Virginia, who disregarded U.S. sentencing guidelines to go easy on a man who was convicted of three counts — convicted of three counts of murder-for-hire — saying that the defendant was naive and unrealistic and undeserving of the punishment required by law."", 'Or Judge Rosemary Barkett, who previously served on the Florida Supreme Court. And while on this court she joined a dissenting opinion that exemplifies the liberal view of the criminal as a victim of society. This is how Judge Barkett described a brutal, racially motivated killing, and I quote: ""This case is not simply a homicide case. It is also a social awareness case. The murder...,"" the judges declared, ""... was motivated by the pervasive illness of racial discrimination and the victim was, in the murderer\'s eyes, only a symbolic representative of the class causing the perceived injustices.""', ""Now when judges make decisions like this, they don't so much as wield a gavel as wield a sledgehammer against the delicate structure of the rule of law. Now this judge was rewarded with a seat on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, where she continues to press her liberal agenda. For this decision, Judge Barkett wins a leading role in the judicial hall of shame."", 'But in many ways, she is outdone by yet another Clinton pointee, Judge H. Lee Sarokin. Judge Sarokin first attained national fame as a federal district court judge, ruling in favor of a homeless man who had been evicted from a public library in New Jersey because he harassed library personnel, talked loudly to himself and emitted a body odor sufficient overpowering to drive away patrons and staff.', 'Judge Sarokin, in a decision of liberal self-righteousness, lectured, and I quote: ""If we wish to shield our eyes and ears from the homeless, we should revoke their condition, not their library cards."" End of quote. The judge attained additional fame when the Third Circuit Court of Appeals took the extraordinary step of removing him from a tobacco case for blatant bias.', 'The New York Times applauded the removal, saying that the judge had flunked an important test of credibility. Even more startling, the same judge, in a West Virginia Law Review, suggests that pre-trial and pre-conviction detention of violent criminals is somehow unconstitutional. Now if this radical position were to prevail, vicious criminals would be free to roam the streets before their convictions or flee until they get caught again — if they are caught again.', 'So this judge who twists the Constitution to impose his liberal views of social policy, whose bias in the courtroom was so blatant that he had to be removed from the case, this judge was handpicked to sit on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, the second highest court in the land and the very court that he had been removed from for bias earlier. I voted against confirming this judge and I have profound questions whether such a man should be sitting on the federal bench, let alone on one of the highest courts in the land.', 'WEBWIRE-', 'DOLE: And I believe it is a profoundly important question that the American people have to ask this November — if our society can afford to keep in office someone who consistently appoints such liberal judges to the federal bench. That will be an issue in the campaign. As it stands now, President Clinton has appointed about 25 percent of all sitting federal judges. In another four years, this could likely go up to about 50 percent or more.', 'So I think we have to ask ourselves — the American people are already asking themselves — do we want a majority of judges on the federal bench to think like Judge Barkett, Brinkema, Baer and Sarokin, an all-star team of liberal leniency, judges who seem intent on dismantling the rule of law from the bench?', ""And then there's the Supreme Court. Since Bill Clinton took office some of the high court's most important rulings on issues ranging from affirmative action to private property rights to religious expression in public schools were decided by just one vote. And, of course, one vote sometimes is very important."", 'So I say to people as I travel around the country, one vote is important. And if President Clinton has four more years and appoints just one more justice to the Supreme Court, we could have the most liberal court since the Warren Court of the 1960s.', 'We can lock in liberal judicial activism for the next generation.', 'And the social landscape could be dramatically changed — more federal intrusion in the lives of average Americans; more centralized power in Washington; less freedom of religious expression; more rights for criminals; and more arrogant disregard of the rights of law-abiding citizens.', 'Now I want to be clear. Obviously, federal judges have a right to protect the rights of the accused. They have a duty; they have a responsibility; they have an obligation. Judges should have the power to strike down laws that are contrary to the Constitution. But the power of the courts to override the sovereign will of the people comes with a very heavy responsibility and must be used with the utmost restraint. And without that restraint, judicial review becomes nothing less than judicial tyranny.', 'And I believe it is vital to America that in the coming months of this campaign, President Clinton and I should debate in a forthright manner our two very different visions of the federal judiciary. He has a clear record. Let him explain to the American people the principles that guided his appointments of the judges I have named and so many others like them.', ""And I will forthrightly and candidly lay down my principles because I believe the American people certainly have the right to know. This is the third branch of government. It's very important."", ""For me, as I have said, foremost among those principles, is respect for the clear and evident meaning of the Constitution, which includes the much neglected and abused 10th Amendment. Dole judges will know the 10th Amendment by heart. It's only 28 words in length, so it shouldn't be too hard to learn. And it says the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by to the states are reserved to the states, respectively, or to the people."", 'In other words, unless the Constitution gives the power to the federal government or denies it to the states, it belongs to the states and to the people.', 'WEBWIRE-', 'DOLE: So the federal power grab will end in my administrations.', ""The judges I appoint will also share the American people and the Constitution's vision of a color-blind society free of discrimination. e are a nation built on the principle of individual rights and responsibilities, and laws that divide our citizens by race or group strike at the heart of what America is all about."", 'After 30 years of liberal experimentation, America knows that state-mandated discrimination caused only bitterness and division, and undermines the foundation of fairness on which any society must be built.', ""Americans deserve fairness, not favoritism. Now I've always been a big believer in public discourse. The more the American people know about what government officials, including federal judges, members of Congress, whoever — are doing in their name, the stronger our democracy will be."", ""As president, I will respect the public's right to know by requiring my attorney general to publish an annual report collecting and summarizing the decisions of our federal judges in the area of criminal law. And thanks to the members of the Fourth Estate, we learned of Judge Baer. But how many similar decisions go unreported, unknown to the public at large?"", 'I also intend to stop the harassment of our legal system by convicted criminals, who last year filed more than 65,000 civil lawsuits against the government in federal court, most of them entirely frivolous. The cost to the taxpayers was about $81 million.', 'Over the same time, the Justice Department initiated only about 45,000 prosecutions. In other words, convicted criminals outscored our Justice Department by 20,000 lawsuits.', ""I introduced a bill to shut down this waste of taxpayer money. President Clinton vetoed it. As president, I will make certain it not only passes, but it's signed."", ""And finally, let me conclude by saying it's time to remove the American Bar Association from its role in reviewing potential judicial appointees. Originally founded to insure competence and integrity in the bar, the ABA has become nothing more than another blatantly partisan liberal advocacy group. In fact, I brought along some of their information here — their lobbying registration."", ""Now some of you might be shocked to learn what they're for and what they against."", 'It lists many of their positions on many of the issues that have come before Congress, and here are some of the highlights. Mandatory minimum sentences for dealers who sell drugs to children the ABA is opposed. A constitutional amendment to protect the flag the ABA is opposed. The religious equality amendment allowing voluntary school prayer — the ABA is opposed.', 'WEBWIRE-', 'DOLE: Meaningful habeas corpus reform, real product liability reform, prison litigation reform.', 'So America has a choice this November. We will continue down the path this administration has set us on — a liberal experimentation in our courts — or we regain the common sense and common wisdom contained in the very clearly written prose of our Constitution. All you have to do is read it.', ""Will we restore competence in the rule of law? Will we restore the American people's trust in the fairness of our legal system? Will the law once again become an expression of our deepest values as a nation? Will it support the guard rails of individual responsibility, of a civil society that itself is truly civil. And I am determined to make the rule of law the rule in America again, and I am in turn going to do all that I can as president to establish the integrity of our courts, and restore safety and fairness and civility to our land '"", 'To establish justice and ensure domestic tranquility are two of the primary objectives of our Constitution. And they will be my sacred objectives as president.', ""Thank you very much for this opportunity. I'd be very happy to respond to questions if there should be questions."", '[applause]', 'MODERATOR: Please move to the microphones for questions, and normal rules apply. Members of the society shall ask questions and please identify yourself by name and by your newspaper.', ""As we assemble, Senator Dole, I'd just like to ask one question. You mentioned that 25 percent of all the sitting judges were appointed by President Clinton, and you mentioned three in particular — Judge Brinkema, Judge Barkett and Judge Sarokan. I think you indicated you voted against Judge Sarokan. I'd like to know how many of that 25 percent that you voted against, and specifically whether you voted against Brinkema and Barkett."", ""DOLE: I voted against Barkett and Sarokan. Most of the judges come up in what we call en bloc — we have eight, nine, ten judges. d of course, the president, normally as I said earlier in my remarks, when the president has a nominee — whether it's a judge or whether it's somebody else — the Judiciary Committee has a hearing. Sometimes they're sort of perfunctory and you never really learn about he judge until, in some cases, they've — they've written decisions or you've found out after the vote, or after there wasn't any vote -most of these are voice votes — what that decision was."", ""But my point is this — it's not the judges President Clinton's appointed. That's the problem. It's what Bob Dole will do — the judges I will appoint as president of the United States, and I've tried to make that clear in my statement."", ""QUESTION: Senator Dole, we appreciate your support of the public's right to know. I'd be interested in where you would stand on the public's right to know how the U.S. Congress would vote on the billion-dollar-a-year ethanol subsidy. It has been asserted that the — that you persuaded House Speaker Gingrich not to hold a vote last September on the subsidy because you felt that it had no chance of passage in the Senate."", 'Even if it does not, would it not be instructive given the efforts of the Republicans — yourself included, I assume — to discipline spending by the U.S. government to have an up or down vote in the House and the Senate on ethanol?', ""DOLE: Well, it's not just ethanol that might affect one or two companies and I know what you're alluding to. I've been on the Finance Committee. I started talking about ethanol when I first came to Congress. We thought we could make some fuel out of wheat. That was back in the '60s, long before anybody was in the ethanol business, so I've been out front on that issue for a long time."", ""Some of the companies that — I know the company that you're alluding to didn't get into the business until '81. I've been talking about it for 15 or 20 years. But I was on the Finance Committee when efforts were made to increase the subsidy, which I opposed."", 'And in 1986, when the last tax law was written, I felt it ought to be made possible for smaller producers to become — to get some of the market share. So it was my amendment, the Dole Amendment, that made that possible.', ""And keep in mind this — we're told by the Government Accounting Office — it's supposed to be sort of an arm of the Congress, an independent agency — that removal of the subsidy would not save money. Right now, we save money in farm programs because farmers get some of their income because of the ethanol industry."", 'WEBWIRE-', ""DOLE: We're talking about corn producers for the most part. In addition, we need alternative fuels. We've been looking for — we don't want to go to war in the Mideast over oil. We've done that in the past. We'd like to have clean alternative fuels. Ethanol's clean. It's environmentally sound and it has broad support."", ""But I'd say this, like anything else, we can look at all the spending. And I don't think that was a very accurate — I did sit in n a meeting with Speaker Gingrich and the Iowa delegation early this ear. And I did indicate that I thought the ethanol program was a good program. It ought to be scrutinized. Maybe it ought to be modified. I'd be prepared to do that."", 'QUESTION: You mentioned the word, penumbra and I believe emanation as well, which are legal terms of art from decisions on privacy that eventually led to the Rowe versus Wade decision on abortion. Is it your hope and expectation that if you have a couple of appointments to make, you will help to produce the overturning of that decision?', 'And secondly, will members of pro-life groups be asked to serve on this new screening panel you want to erect for the consideration of judicial appointments?', ""DOLE: The answer to the latter is no. I don't believe in litmus tests. I'm trying to expand the Republican Party. And I don't give tests before you can enter. I stayed up all night one night trying to think of somebody I didn't want to vote for me. And I couldn't think of anybody."", '[laughter]', ""And I feel pretty much the same about the party. We're a big party. We have diversity in our party. That's certainly one issue where we have a division. But I've said to the chagrin of some that I don't believe in a litmus test. I refuse to sign a pledge earlier this year, last year in the primaries. But I'm pro-life — have been — proud of it."", ""But I'm not going to use that as a test for anybody I appoint to the court."", 'QUESTION: I want to ask you a question that I asked you during the New Hampshire campaign...', ""DOLE: Yeah, I've forgotten about New Hampshire. Yes ... [laughter]"", 'DOLE: At least I try to forget about New Hampshire.', ""QUESTION: What you dodged at the time, for good reason, is about Justice Souter who happens to be from New Hampshire. In light of your remarks, I'd like you to talk about what you thought you were getting hen you voted for Justice Souter, talk about what you think of his record since being appointed to the Supreme Court. And talk about ether he is the kind of justice you would appoint."", ""DOLE: I'm not certain what I thought I was getting with Justice outer. I relied a great deal on what my friend Senator Rudman said at the time. I thought we were getting and I think we did a strict constructionist who may be his own person. That doesn't bother me."", ""And I'd be looking for someone, as I said — I'm going to try make it clear — I mentioned it twice in my statement — somebody who's read the Constitution, understands what it means, knows what the 10th Amendment's all about, and is not trying to be a judicial activist. Our view is, if you want to be an activist run for Congress or run for the legislature, run for governor, run for president. But don't apply to be on the court."", 'So that will be my criteria.', ""QUESTION: Senator Dole, how are you, Senator? I don't get back this way very often but I noticed in the papers this week that you and our other senator, Nancy Kassebaum, are in a little ruckus over health care reform."", 'WEBWIRE-', ""DOLE: Oh, don't believe it."", ""QUESTION: Well, that's my question. is this true? And if it is true, I'd like to hear your side of it."", ""DOLE: It's not true."", '[laughter]', ""No, I think it's fair to say that Senator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy — she's chairman of the Labor Committee, and he's the ranking Democrat on the committee — they reported a bill out, and I've done this myself as chairman, and I said, I don't want any amendments on my bill."", ""That's perfectly legitimate. That doesn't mean you're not going to get any amendments on your bill. So we offered amendments yesterday totalling $8 billion. The one we lost were the medical savings account, which I happen to think is a pretty good idea."", ""It's still in the House bill. I'm a conferee on that issue, and Nancy is not. And so who knows what will happen in the conference, who may have the last word."", ""But we get along famously, and if I was as popular as Nancy Kassebaum, I know I'd win in November."", 'MODERATOR: A question over here, Senator.', 'QUESTION: Senator Dole, under a Dole presidency, would you refer to protect the flag or to protect free speech? Can you have both?', ""DOLE: I think, well — I'm not certain you have to make that choice. In my view, there are certain cases, like yelling fire in a crowded theater, I think that the flag is very symbolic of this country, of America, of sacrifices made by Americans the past 200 years."", ""And so I sided with protecting the flag, but I didn't do it with the thought in mind that I was somehow abridging somebody's rights in the First Amendment. I mean, it seems to me, when people do what they do to the American flag, there ought to be some recourse."", 'MODERATOR: A question over here.', 'QUESTION: How are you?', 'DOLE: Like Kansas day, yes.', '[laughter]', ""QUESTION: This is on foreign policy. You've been a voice of popular discontent on American foreign policy for many years. On Bosnia not so long ago, you did what seemed a presidential thing by supporting President Clinton's tough decision to deploy troops."", ""I'm curious to ask you now whether or not you feel that with respect to the delivery of Iranian arms to the Bosnian government, do you agree with New York Times columnist William Safire that, in fact, President Clinton standing aside while that happened was simply dumb?"", ""DOLE: Well, I wouldn't characterize it, but I — well, let me just tell you where I come from because I did support the President. When he said troops are going to Bosnia, I stood up on the Senate floor and I said I support the President. He's made that decision. They were on their way. They were already on the ground."", ""And a lot of my friends didn't like it. But that was beside the point. I think it was the right thing to do. Now we knew that arms were going to Bosnia. We didn't know where they were coming from. Some guessed Iran. We didn't know that to be the case."", ""And we stood on the floor I don't know how many times, myself and Senator Lieberman, a Democrat from Connecticut, and Bob Dole, the Dole-Lieberman amendment — the very thing that candidate Clinton advocated in 1992, lift the embargo. In fact, he went as far as saying we ought to have air strikes."", ""We should let the Muslims defend themselves, and it was our view, my view and Joe Lieberman's view and 67 other senators — we had 69 votes — that had we done that, had we lifted the embargo, because Bosnia was an independent nation, a member of the United Nations and under Article 51, they had to right to self-defense. Except they couldn't defend themselves, they didn't have the arms."", ""And we thought the better part of wisdom was to send the arms and not send American troops. So we learned later — in fact, 10 days ago - that during this time there's sort of a wink and a nod at Iranian arms shipments through Croatia. And we also know the Iranians are now supplying the Hizbollah, who are creating havoc in northern Israel, and in turn creating havoc in Lebanon."", 'It seems to me that we picked the wrong partner.', 'WEBWIRE-', ""DOLE: My view is that it's a mistake. It was our view that if we shipped the arms, we would be able to control what kind of arms went to Bosnia in the first place, and it would have been a much better situation."", ""So I think the President made a mistake. I wouldn't characterize it as, maybe, Mr. Safire did."", 'MODERATOR: One last question, Senator Dole.', ""QUESTION: I want to ask you about something that may not be a very popular type of question — or rather Texan — or very popular with other Texans, but when you mentioned the causes of crime, you spoke specifically about drugs and violence and movies and TV. You didn't say anything about guns or the easy availability of guns. And it seems to me, you also — and I know you also said that crime is conducted by criminals."", 'And on the other hand, many of the really serious situations involving guns in this country have happened at the hands of people who are not considered normally criminals. They were family members or people with a grievance of their own.', ""So I'd like to know how you feel about the availability of guns to the American people, and then specifically, what is the role of the NRA and the feelings of yourself and other members of Congress about this?"", ""DOLE: Well, I can't speak for the NRA. They supported somebody else in the primary. But, you know, I know a lot of good NRA members in my state."", ""I've got a better idea that 16 states have already adopted that we'll be spelling out in detail here, maybe in the next 30 to 60 days. It's called the instant check."", ""I've had a feeling for a long time — it's not something I reamed up election year. I've been working on this for five or six ears."", ""We have about, I think, 20 million names now in a computer right ere in Washington, D.C. of people who should not have guns — hand guns, shot guns, any kind of gun. They're convicted felons. They're dishonorably discharged. They've been adjudged legally insane. There are eight different categories already in the law of people who should not have weapons."", ""And what we need to do is to have a national instant check. And how does the instant check work? It works like any other you go in to buy something in a store. You put the little card in there and it says tilt, you don't get the merchandise."", ""There isn't a waiting period. It's about 30 seconds. And we will have an instant check system. We've already started it several years ago but it's been slowed down. Yet 16 states think it's a good idea. That's up from nine just a year and a half ago."", ""Why shouldn't we do it on a national basis? Why should you have a shotgun? Why should you have a handgun? Why should you have any gun? if you're in any one of these categories?"", ""And that will be my effort. Having felt the sting of a gun, I'm not so anxious for anybody else to feel the sting, and I'd like to make handguns inaccessible to people who should not have them. I think law-abiding citizens are different."", ""But certainly, the things we can do, things we should have done. I mean, in this age of technology, to say that we can't have an instant check on weapons when somebody buys a gun — you go into a hardware store or a gun store. All they got to do is the same thing they do now when you go into a clothing store. They put the little card in there, and you don't get the gun if you're in one of those categories."", ""It's an instant check with a system in Washington, D.C., a central computer system where you've got millions and millions of names of people right now who shouldn't have a weapon and probably have a weapon."", ""I mentioned earlier, I visited California — I visited the LA police there, too. The weapon of choice now among gangs is a nine millimeter pistol. Ninety-some percent of the gang members use a nine millimeter pistol. They don't use the so-called — some of the assault weapons because they're hard to conceal."", ""And I know the press just loves assault weapons. You love the an. I bet you don't know that ten of the 17 or 18 weapons that are in the ban have been modified and are back on the street. The ban is not the way to do it. We need to make certain that the people who shouldn't have a gun don't get a gun, any gun. Might even include a pop gun, who knows?"", ""So let's have an instant check. Let's have it national. And et's reduce the rate of crimes committed with guns, whether it's family members or whether it's somebody else. That will be my suggestion to the American people. And I believe it's a good one. I believe it will have bipartisan support."", 'QUESTION: Thank you.', 'DOLE: Is that it?', 'MODERATOR: One last question.', 'QUESTION: Senator Dole.', ""MODERATOR: This is the last question. I'm sorry."", ""QUESTION: Senator Dole, I'm from the Virginian-Pilot in Virginia, where states rights was a big issue 130 years ago."", '[laughter]', ""There's a growing body of evidence that implicates both political journalists and politicians of being engaged in a political discourse that's badly disconnected from the real troubles in people's lives. The troubles in Virginians' lives, when you sit down to listen to them, have to do with job security, have to do with the future of the children, have to do with prudent use of government funds, and a little bit to do with the end of partisan bickering."", ""They don't spend a lot of time talking about federal judges. Could you speak to your responsibility as the chief spokesman for the Republican Party in getting this discourse reconnected to the troubles in people's lives?"", ""DOLE: Well, maybe I should take you with me. Maybe you ought to get on our campaign plane. I'll take you out where they talk about federal judges — most anywhere in America — but I think you're right on the other count."", ""I don't believe many Americans, regardless of their party, and this is why the Perot phenomenon developed in 1992 — most Americans want us to get things done. That doesn't mean everything, but the right things, we ought to get done. The other things we ought to forget."", ""And I find most Americans concerned about their jobs — somebody, the neighbor's lost a job, they've had a downsizing of a corporation, whatever — and they're concerned about jobs. They're concerned about heir families. They're concerned about their children — real concerns in America."", ""They want us to address these concerns. So we're going to address the concerns. And my view is that whether it's Virginia or whether it's Kansas, or whether it's California, most people have pretty much the same concerns."", ""Some — you go to California, it's defense contracts. You go somewhere else out in the Midwest, it's — maybe it's ethanol or maybe it's the price of corn or the price of wheat, or somewhere else it's small business."", ""But I think what the American people — hopefully, what they're searching for are members of Congress, a federal establishment if you will, that understands their concerns and will live the way they have to live. Now to some people in the media, a vision is more federal spending. That's not my vision for America."", 'My vision for America is a balanced budget, tax cuts for families with children, reforming welfare, downsizing government, making America a better place to live, having a strong defense — something that you can touch and feel and I think has a lasting impact.', ""So I don't disagree with the question, and I hope we can provide the answer. But there are always going to be some — I mean, I've been in politics for a while. I've learned that there are some people who are never going to be quite satisfied with anyone — Democrat or Republican or Independent. They're going to find something that they disagree on. That's certainly a right we have in America."", ""But for the most part, I believe the American — I have a lot of trust, and I think that's one of the things we'll stress — I happen to trust the American people. Others trust the government more. I trust the people. I trust the states. I trust governors — Democrats or Republicans, legislators — Democrats or Republicans. I want to return more power to the states — welfare reform, Medicaid, all in accordance with the 10th amendment."", ""And in my view, that resonates with the American people. As long as they don't get tied up in all this Congressional jargon, the inside-the-Beltway talk that doesn't make any sense to anybody."", 'Thank you.', 'MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Senator.', '[applause]', 'Thank you, Senator Dole, for sharing your views with us today, and please stay seated as Senator Dole leaves the room.']"

The entire world shares the sorrow of the long- suffering Iraqi people. But, the Iraqi people are not suffering because of international sanctions, they are suffering because of the policies and practices of Saddam Hussein. It is clear that Saddam Hussein is beginning to feel the economic pain so long felt by the people he oppresses -- and that has political consequences. In such circumstances, offering Saddam Hussein a lifeline to prolong his dictatorship is bad policy and bad strategy,.', '""Saddam Hussein\'s track record makes it clear that he can be given no room for flexibility on any sanctions relief. Saddam\'s record also makes clear- that he will use any sanctions relief to claim political triumph over the Desert Storm coalition. Saddam Hussein\'s government has not met the conditions set out in U.N. resolutions adopted in 1991. Yet the Clinton Administration has pressed ahead with sanctions relief with an accord that raises a number of fundamental questions, especially on distribution and monitoring.', '""The United Nation\'s effort to monitor the use of oil revenues will apparently be headed by Yasushi Akashi -- a veteran of the disastrous UNPROFOR operation in Bosnia. It is also interesting to note that one of United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali\'s closest advisers is an Iraqi national and long-time member of the Iraqi diplomatic corps. The United States could have and should have insisted that neither of these officials play any role in policy toward Iraq. I do not share the Clinton Administration\'s faith that a U.N. monitoring effort will protect American interests. And I am deeply concerned about relying on Iraqi government promises about distribution.', '""Too often, the Clinton Administration\'s \'assertive multilateralism,"" has not asserted American interests and has been an excuse to avoid American leadership. United Nations sanctions on Iraq would not be lifted or eased without American acquiescence. President Clinton needs to learn when to say \'no\' to the United Nations. The Clinton Administration argues it has made improvements in the U.N.- proposed lifeline for Saddam Hussein. That is not leadership, it is abdication.

In reality, however, it's proof of the president's belief that fixing welfare is a job best handled from Washington, D.C."", ""As any of our 50 governors can tell you, Wisconsin is one of many states who have to play the so-called waiver game, trekking to Washington, D.C., hat in hand to beg for approval to fix a failed system. Waiver applications often run over 100 pages, and the turn-around time is measured in years and not days. As a matter of fact, there are currently 27 other welfare waivers and 18 states currently awaiting the president's approval."", 'Some of these applications have been pending since 1994.

Such a response is too little and too late for the families trapped in a failed system. In a Dole administration, no state will have to play the waiver game."", 'Washington does not have all the answers.

As we all know, illegitimacy is what perpetuates a cycle of poverty from generation to generation. And too often it turns out that the baby born on welfare belongs to a girl, who herself is almost a baby, and who was born on welfare."", ""But we're just beginning to recognize that perhaps half of the fathers of those babies are grown men, 20 years old, or over. In other words, a central feature of the plague of illegitimacy is that older men pray upon young girls. Just as in the absence of presidential leadership, the nation's governors have taken the lead in reforming welfare in America today. Let me urge the nation of governors to take one more big step. Enforce the statutory rape laws you already have on your books and make them stronger where they ought to be stronger, but enforce them to the fullest."", '[applause]', 'Solving the welfare problem must be including ending the epidemic of male sexual predators. And in my administration, we will also recognize that it is absolutely right for the states to sanction welfare recipients who test positive for drugs.

And that same Columbia University report estimates that as many as 200,000 drug exposed babies are born annually to mothers on AFDC.', ""Basic compassion and common sense dictate that the government must stop being the enabler of those who abuse drugs. Senator Christopher Bond of Missouri has pointed out that some welfare recipients who were turned down for employment because they flunk an employer's drug test, then turn around and use the results of that test, as proof that they are actually seeking employment, and deserve to remain on welfare. Now, that's sort of a twisted view, but that's the way it works."", ""And I believe the states should have the right, the state should have the right to require drug testing and deny, on their face, claims like the one Senator Bond discussed. And states should also have the right to adopt innovators such as providing welfare recipients with vouchers for diapers or baby formula in place of cash payments which might be used to purchase drugs or alcohol. I think it's a common sense solution."", '[applause]', ""So, it's also the right time. It's also the right time for the state and federal government to step out of the surrogate parent role and ask people to take personal responsibility for their lives."", '[applause]', ""It's about time we take personal responsibility, something we forgot in the last two or three decades in many cases."", ""DOLE: Each year, America fails to collect $34 billion of child support payments and that's a national disgrace.

We will automate child support proceedings in every state.', '[applause]', ""And require that every effort is made to establish paternity.

We've been working on it for 10-15-20 years, started out a long time ago with Senator Long on the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Long, when he was chairman, from the great state of Louisiana."", 'Let me just say one more fact. The ultimate issue at stake here in serious welfare reform is not just dollars. It is not how many dollars and sense we can save but compassion.', ""It is not compassionate to lead people into a life of drugs, dependency and despair. There's nothing compassionate about that, but we've been doing it for 30 or 40 years."", ""Real compassion must sometimes take the form of tough love. It's time to get people out of the destructive lifestyles of welfare once and for all -children having children should stay at home and stay in school."", 'And my friends, we know what happened this weekend.

Remember, he told you that in '92 and then gave you a big, big tax increase, so you'll read between the lines."", ""But, I would say this. In the last few weeks, I have spoken on issues that I believe are critical to the future of our nation. Issues which are profound and point out the profound and fundamental differences between myself and Bill Clinton. I think that's what the American people, people in Macomb County, this area, have a right to know."", ""About the kinds of men and women who should be appointed as federal judges. About ending and not just talking about the welfare system that has literally condemned generations to dependency and despair. About a foreign policy that understands America's interests and ideals and proudly stands up for them."", ""And about realizing Ronald Reagan's dream of building a defense to protect American against nuclear missiles. And I would say at that point, if I asked most people, what you have the president do if there was an incoming missile, ballistic missile, you would say, shoot it down. We can't, because President Clinton opposes it, and we support it."", ""But I'm here today to talk about another defining issue. Another question that divides the president and me and that will be decided by the people this November 5, by you, and by voters all across America."", ""Another issue that'll determine America's future for generations to come. And that is balancing the federal budget. And here's the heart of the matter. Unlike Mr. Clinton, I don't believe that problems that American people are taxed too little."", 'I believe the federal government is too big and spends too much money. And in my administration, that will stop. We will change it. We will change it.', '[applause]', ""And in the months ahead, you'll be hearing me talk more and more about the difference between Mr. Clinton and me on this very important issue."", 'DOLE: He imposed the largest tax increase in the history of America on you, the people. And I intend to go precisely in the opposite direction. I believe we can cut taxes, reform the tax code, and balance the budget.', 'In fact, we must if we want to restore our nation to its full economic potential with faster growth and greater opportunity and a rising standard of living for our people.', ""And let me start by saying that in this campaign, the American people's biggest challenge will be to distinguish between words and actions, between words and actions. That is, because unfortunately, as we have seen time and time again, the words this president speaks have very little to do with the actions he takes. Put simply, he talks right and runs left."", 'But I believe the American people deserve better than zig-zag leadership. And nowhere', '[applause]', 'And nowhere is this disconnect more true than on the question of the federal budget. And nowhere is it more pivotal. For whether or not we actually bring the budget into balance in the next few years will depend, more than anything else on the will and determination of the president of the United States. And as things stand in the Congress and the country today, if the president of the United States wants a balanced budget, we will have a balanced budget.', ""But this president's action made clear that he does not. I do. I do because I believe a federal budget that is balanced in the right way, with less spending, that permits lower taxes is a key, a critical key, to making America better for families and to restarting America's engine of economic growth."", 'Now some say that, ""Well, deficits don\'t matter, that the American people just don\'t care about them."" But the fact is that the federal budget is like a tax hike on working families. It drives up interest rates and not by a little but by a lot. It is a stealth tax that every family with a home, every father and mother with a child in college, every young person who buys a car must pay and pay and pay and pay.', 'And what is this stealth tax in dollar terms? Well, over $36,000 on a typical home mortgage, more than $1,400 on an ordinary student loan, nearly $700 on a typical car loan.', ""Everytime a family uses its credit card, it's paying that hidden tax, and the worst thing is it's a tax without any benefit. Higher interest rates simply means the consumer's money vanishes as if a pickpocket took your wallet."", ""That's what economists tell us. That is the cost of pushing up interest rates by about two percentage points. And as Americans, our budgets are constrained because the federal government's budget is not. And I say this stealth tax is wrong. It's wrong for families. It's wrong for workers. And it's wrong for our economy."", ""And I think it's time that it's eliminated."", '[applause]', ""It's time we eliminate that and when I am elected on November 5, that's exactly what I intend to do."", ""DOLE: Instead of giving more money to Washington to let the government grow, I want to leave more money with the taxpayers to let the family grow and prosper, and that's a big, big difference."", '[applause]', ""And I've said, I think as long as I've been around here, when we return to the economic values that once made the American family great, we'll strengthen the values that have made American great."", ""Now, where does President Clinton stand? That's a fair question."", ""And now that we're starting another campaign, and he has to face that American people again, he says he's for a balanced budget — again. But when it comes to balancing the budget, as with everything else, Bill Clinton's promises are like the tape in Mission Impossible. They self-destruct in about 10 seconds."", '[laughter]', '[applause]', 'Now think back to 1992. In the last campaign, candidate Clinton went on LARRY KING LIVE and promised to balance the budget in five years. A very clear statement.', ""When he got into office, his first budget had deficits as far as the eye could see. No balance anywhere. In fact, maybe there's an ad running in this area which says 10 years, nine years, eight years, seven years, six years, five years. Any of the above."", '[laughter]', ""That's where he was. And for the first of many times, he did the exact opposite of what held promised."", 'And I think you can judge a president by what he does in his first 100 days. What did Bill Clinton do?', ""He proposed what we call an economic stimulus package which wouldn't have stimulated anything except the insatiable appetite of big government. And instead of restarting — or restraining spending, he wanted to spend more than $16 billion on new pork barrel projects and political patronage to fund such critical programs like $1 million for a boating marina in Key West, a $2.5 million alpine slide in Puerto Rico — I haven't quite figured how that's going to work."", '[laughter]', 'One million dollars to construct a casino, $5 million to renovate a brewery, and $2.7 million for a movie theater.', 'Now, those are only just a few examples. The pork trough was 800 pages long, and the hogs would still be feeding in it today of Bill Clinton had gotten his way. But he was stopped by a united front of Senate Republicans. Every Senate Republican stood up and said, ""No."" every Senate Republican. And we only had 44 at the time.', ""So, when we took over the Congress tow years later, we said it was not time just to talk about a balanced budget, but to do something about it. And we put a balanced budget amendment up for a vote. And I must say we had a number of people of good will on the other side in the president's party who supported us."", 'But the White House lobbied furiously against us, and rounded up enough support to defeat the amendment by one vote. One vote. We needed 67, we got 66. So we lost on the constitutional amendment.', 'But then for the first time in a generation, as the governor alluded to, we passed a budget that was balanced. Not an amendment saying the budget should be balanced, but this time an actual budget. The president vetoed in, not once, but he vetoed it twice. A double whammy against the U.S. taxpayers.', 'And, ladies and gentlemen, I can say this with all honesty, he has fought us every step of the way.', 'DOLE: He sent up a smoke screen of rhetoric. He used scare tactics and every bit of patronage and power he had to strongarm members of his own party and keep them in line. He sent up a phoney budget with phoney numbers that fooled no one. With every action he could take he demonstrated his fundamental hostility to restraining the growth of government.', 'Now, don\'t take my word for it. As economic journalist Robert Samuelson wrote recently — and I\'m quoting him now — ""A president is supposed to help illuminate and resolve critical national choices. Clinton not only didn\'t do this, but he frustrated the process by viciously attacking those who tried."" End of quote.', 'And then Samuelson continued, ""The Republicans attempted to broaden the budget debate in a constructive way. They insisted on reaching a balanced budget. Clinton\'s 1996 budget envisioned perpetual deficits."" End of quote. And Samuelson concluded with this, ""Only when it was clear that Congress would enact a balanced budget did Clinton embrace the goal. Only when it was clear, did he embrace the goal."" Those aren\'t my words. Not a Republican economist. Those are Robert Samuelson\'s words.', ""So now at least the president says he's for a balanced budget. We'll see what happens. As most of you know, I will soon be leaving the United States Senate. In fact, it's down to days now. It occurred to me that I should demonstrate to the American people — Republicans and Democrats and Independents — that you can't always have it both ways. And I know some, maybe in this audience, always assume that those of us in politics will work it out somewhere where we can't lose. If I lose this I've still got this."", ""So it occurred to me to demonstrate to the American people, to Republicans and Independents and Democrats who are looking for leadership, that I should roll the dice. As I say, give up all the trappings of power. Give up the comfort and security that some would say we have in the United States Senate; give up the Majority Leader's office and go to American people and listen to the America people and talk about America and talk about your families and your children and your hopes and your aspirations."", 'And I believe I made the right choice. The American people want leadership.', '[applause]', ""But before I leave I'm going to bring up that balanced budget amendment one more time. One more time!"", '[applause]', ""Thank you. If the American people vote on a balanced budget tomorrow it would pass by an overwhelming majority; 83 percent, according to recent a Gallup poll. In this, Washington should learn from the Wisdom of the American people. So let me say it right now. Mr. Clinton, we all know that your Democratic colleagues in the Senate will look to you for a thumbs up or a thumbs down on this vote. You are the leader of one of America's two great parties. You're leadership on this issue matters."", ""DOLE: It really matters. And if you're as serious as you say about balancing the federal budget, if you've really had a real change of heart, if you truly want to stand with the American people, tell your Democratic colleagues in the Senate to vote for the balanced budget amendment, vote for the balanced budget amendment."", '[applause]', 'And, Mr. President, do it in public. And do it now.', '[laughter]', 'No winks. No nods. No behind the scenes maneuvers. No excuses. And do it loudly. And do it clearly. As they say in the commercial, just do it. Just do it.', '[applause]', 'And to paraphrase President Reagan, Mr. Clinton, tear down this wall of resistance to a balanced budget amendment. Tear down this wall of resistance to a balanced budget amendment.', '[applause]', ""Now let me say while I'm making this offer in good faith, I'm not holding my breath. When it comes to this president and this Oval Office, I'm not sure the buck stops there, but I'm certain reform does."", ""And I said earlier that the critical issue in balancing the budget and reducing the burden of the government on all Americans is presidential will, presidential will. And here in Michigan, you have one of America's best examples of how critical executive leadership is — Governor John Engler."", '[applause]', ""When John Engler was elected — and I can't resist saying it was a come-from-behind victory — Michigan was cited as a poster child of the Rust Belt with a staggering deficit. Property taxes were the third highest in America and unemployment was the highest of the industrial states."", 'Leadership and will changed all of that because John Engler kept his promises. He did what he said he would do, eliminating the deficit with spending cuts, downsizing government bureaucracy, and in contrast to the conventional wisdom in Washington, he also cut taxes — 21 times — for both families and businesses.', 'And you know the results.', '[applause]', 'You know the results.', 'Today Michigan has been transformed into a growth model for the nation. As the governor said, employment is up with 450,000 jobs created since 1991. The budget is in surplus. And per capita income growth is the fastest in the nation.', ""What John Engler has done for Michigan, I want to do for America, and with your help, we'll get it done. We need your help."", '[applause]', ""And it's no mystery on what's holding America back. It's no force of nature or act of fate. It's the wrong-headed, out-dated liberal policies that can all be summed up in one word — Clintonomics, Clintonomics. That's the word, one word, Clintonomics."", '[applause]', 'And you know one of the most amazing things about the present administration is they actually boast about the anemic substandard growth their policies have created.', 'DOLE: Remember in the last campaign in 1992 and it happened here in Michigan, Mr. Clinton\'s rallying cry and I quote was, ""It\'s the economy, stupid""?', 'At that time, the economy was actually growing more than 50 percent faster than it has during the Clinton years — 50 percent faster.', 'The natural business cycle was pulling us strongly out of recession at that time with impressive growth.', ""But then Clinton's big government and high tax policy slammed on the brakes, and you know sometimes I think that Bill Clinton must be a very incredible magician. He took a middle class tax cut he promised in the campaign, he put it in the hat, and pulled out the biggest tax increase in the history of America — $265 billion tax increase. Don't forget that number."", ""And while Michigan, with John Engler's spending and tax cuts, was booming, what was happening to the rest of America? Bill Clinton's tax increases. We call it the Clinton crunch."", ""Workers saw their wages stagnate. Families had to work harder just to make ends meet. Judged against America's average growth for the entire post-war period, Clinton economic policies threw this country into a growth deficit that, according to Congress and the Joint Economic Committee, will cost the average household an astonishing $3,100 per year — that's $260 per month."", 'No wonder more and more American families feel they are falling behind. No wonder they feel the security of the past years is slipping away from them. And no wonder more and more Americans are saying our country is on the wrong track.', 'So this year, ""It\'s the economy, stupid"" takes on a whole new meaning. Bill Clinton is hoping the rest of us are stupid so we won\'t notice what a mess he\'s made of the economy. That\'s the new meaning of his slogan. And the way to get America back on the right track, the fast track to growth and prosperity, starts with letting families keep more of what they earn.', 'It means taming and restraining the federal budget, and giving the family budget a long overdue break so that more spending decisions are made on Main Street, U.S.A., and fewer on Pennsylvania Avenue in the District of Columbia.', 'It means curing the wasteful spending addiction this administration is hooked on so that we can cut taxes, including the Clinton stealth tax, pull our nation out of the Clinton growth deficit and release our country from the Clinton crunch.', ""It means replacing uncertainty with security, replacing hopelessness with jobs, and replacing doubt with opportunity. And it all starts with replacing the Clinton administration in Washington on November 5. It won't happen unless that happens."", '[applause]', ""So if you'll help me, if you'll help me restore leadership to the White House, I promise that I will do all that I possibly can to help restore the full greatness of America."", ""You see, I believe leadership should be more than self-gratification. It should be about more than the politics of the moment. Leadership is about service, service to something greater than oneself. That's what leadership's about — greater than all of us, something as large and as grand as the promise and hope of America."", ""DOLE: It's about answering that call like so many millions of ordinary servicemen and women have done, like so many daily heroes in American life have done, paying the price, accepting the burden, giving something back to the country that has given you and given the world so much."", ""It's also about simple truths — telling the truth, the way I learned to do it in Russell, Kansas, a small town filled with big people, not big in money or prestige but big at heart, humanity, integrity and love — simple truths like doing the right thing, like saying what you mean and meaning what you say and sticking to it, even paying a price for your stubbornness when making excuses would be much, much easier."", 'It means having a faith in this land of freedom as strong as the faith of the pioneers who built it, a sustaining faith that carries you through the tough times and lights your way to the good ones.', ""So I've been talking here today about economics, but the real issue is even deeper than any numbers could represent. It goes to the heart of why we want to balance the budget and cut taxes."", 'It underlies all our goals of reforming the welfare morass, of rebuilding our military and strengthening our courts.', ""Fundamentally, it gets down to a very basic issue of values, what we believe America's been is and must remain — a nation of freedom, where the doors of opportunity are open to all, where our government respects the values on which families and neighborhoods and communities are built."", ""And that is why I'm running for president. I want to be the president of the United States because I believe that together we can put America back on the right track. Together we can get this economy moving again. Together we can put basic American values back at the center of our public life. Together we can restore the full greatness of this blessed land of liberty."", ""And that's what this is all about in this year of 1996. It's about you. It's about your business. It's about jobs. It's about opportunities, about taxes, about your families, your children, and education, and all the things you're concerned about in this great state of Michigan."", ""That's what this election in 1996 is all about. As I've tried to state in my statement, above all, it's about leadership, it's about will, it's about telling the truth. It's about doing the right thing. It's about making tough decisions. It's about standing up for America — standing up for America."", ""And as great as we are today, there's no doubt in my mind that our best days and years are ahead of us.

I could see the smoke drifting out under the door."", '[laughter]', 'And when that was going on, I knew Ab was thinking about how we can defeat Democrats.', '[laughter]', ""And that's where Bill got the bug.

It's about real people with real ambition and real hopes and real aspirations who want to get ahead in America, and they're looking to us for leadership."", 'And I thought to myself since President Clinton vetoed the balanced budget, interest rates have increased over one percent, and had that not happened, they could have had their dream home.', ""They could have had it. Instead, they're going to have to wait. And had the president signed credits, tax credits for families with children, $500 per child, they could have had their dream home. And Jennifer Dunn told me tonight when I spoke to the House Republicans earlier — I told the same story — and she said, good, we're talking about people."", ""And that's what I'm all about. It's not the people way up here. It's the people trying to get up there, trying to get up the ladder. And many of you in this audience made it up the ladder the hard way.

Not everybody could go off to war."", ""But they made a difference because they believed in America.

I love the House of Representatives. I never wanted to be the House of Representatives here, I wanted to be in the Senate.

And yes, the institution has its imperfections, or occasional inefficiency.', ""And we're like America. We're still a work in progress in the United States Senate."", 'So I would say to my colleagues, I remember way back when I ran for the Kansas legislature. We had a Democratic law librarian who thought young people ought to get involved in politics. So she found two Republicans and two Democrats and talked us into running for the state legislature.', ""We didn't know anything about politics — didn't even know what party we were in. We were students, veterans going to school under the GI Bill. And I thought about which party to belong to, and I've said in jest from time to time, I went back to my hometown and went up to the courthouse and found out there were more Republicans than Democrats, and I became a committed Republican."", '[laughter]', ""Not quite accurate, but my parents were Democrats. And I remember the first time I was ever approached by a reporter. Here I was a brand new, I was a law student, brand new legislature, I didn't know anything about anything. And he said, well, what are you going to do now for your district, or something of that case."", ""I said, oh, I'm going to sit around, watch for a couple of days and stand up for what's right."", ""Well, that's what we all do around here. And I hope I've done it over the years. And I would not, just take a minute or two to indulge in, you know, some of the things, we all have different interests."", ""I've been deeply involved in agriculture, as many of you have here, because Kansas is a farm state. And when I came to Congress, I was on the House Ag committee, and I've been on the Senate Ag committee ever since."", ""And so I'm proud of having served the farm families of Kansas and around America, who make a lot of sacrifices. This year we didn't have a wheat crop hardly at all in Kansas, because of the drought. I'm advised by Senator Dorgan, they're not going to have much of one because of the wet -the water. So farmers make a lot of sacrifices."", 'And I remember back in the Vietnam debate, some of us were here, and some were on each side of the issue. The so-called Cooper-Church amendments, it went on and on and on, week after week after week, on whether we ought to withdraw our troops or shut off funding, which I thought was wrong.', 'And as I look back on it, I think I was right, because we had courageous men like Bob Kerrey and John McCain and others in this chamber who were risking their lives, and they deserved our support. And that was the big debate of the time.', ""And I've also been proud to be involved in nutrition programs. Somebody mentioned that earlier today. I remember working with Senator McGovern, and that crops up now and then in conservative articles, saying that I can't be a conservative because I know George McGovern."", '[laughter]', 'DOLE: I think George McGovern is a gentleman and has always been a gentleman.', ""But we worked together on food stamps. And I'll confess, when we first — When I made my first tour with George McGovern, I said, this guy's running for president."", ""I wasn't convinced. There are a lot of skeptics in this chamber, probably some on each side. If you can't have pure motives, it's always something political."", 'But after being on that trip about two or three days, I changed my mind, and Senator Hollings was in the forefront of that effort. He remembers how bad it was in South Carolina.', 'And so, we worked together on food stamps and the WIC program and the school lunch program, particularly when it affected low income Americans. And I think, as I look at it, no first class democracy can treat its people like second class citizens. And I remember standing on this floor managing the Martin Luther King Holiday Bill.', ""We had the majority. It was a proud day for me. It's now a national holiday."", 'And the first speech I ever made on the floor was April 14, 1969 about disabled Americans.', 'And I know a lot of people in this room who have worked on that program, and I know Senator Kennedy and Senator Harkin and Senator Durenberger when he was here, and Senator Jennings Randolph before, maybe before many of you came, was in the forefront.', ""We stood with many who couldn't stand on their own. And the highlight was passing the Americans With Disabilities Act."", ""Forty-three million Americans — they're not all seriously disabled but there are many in wheelchairs, many who can't even sit up. And it was a very impressive sight to be at the White House the day that bill was signed by President Bush.

Never.', ""And now more and more, Americans with disabilities are full participants in the process. They're in the mainstream."", 'So, I remember 1983, and I know Pat Moynihan remembers. We were standing right over in this aisle. We had a bipartisan commission on Social Security. We had met week after week, month after month, and it was about to go down the drain. We had about given up. Everybody was just disgusted. We were getting short-tempered.', 'We were Democrats and Republicans — the late John Heinz was a member of that commission.

And we said we've got to try one more time to rescue Social Security. One more time. It wasn't a partisan issue, and we did."", 'That afternoon, we convened three more people. We had five of the commission.', ""DOLE: And it wasn't long they were back on track and we finally made it happen. And 37 million people have gotten their checks on time and I think I read in the Washington Post just this weekend, Social Security's going to be in pretty good shape until the year 2029. So that's a pretty good fix. That may be a pattern. As I said earlier today, we can follow on Medicare for the long term solution. Take it out of politics as we did on Social Security."", 'Make it work, make it solvent. And the people who get the credit are the people that get the checks, 37 million of them. So we reached across partisan lines.', ""So I'm worried a little about the future. I worry about our defenses. I know there are a lot of very talented people here who are going to continue to do that. I'm not here to make a partisan speech or even a partisan reference. But I would hope that we will keep in mind that there are still threats around the world. And also keep in mind that we're the envy of the world."", 'I learned meeting with a lot of leaders — foreign leaders — as leaders get to do in this business and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, Senator Pell and others.', ""Senator Lugar when he was chairman. I remember when the Berin Wall came down and the Soviet Empire collapsed a lot of people started coming to America and they were leaders and they were young and they were old and they were men and they were women and they didn't come for foreign aid. The cynics said oh, they're coming after more of our money. They knew we didn't have any. But for the first time in 70 years in some cases they had a right to travel. They could get on an airplane without checking with the government and waiting for a year or two years or three years. They could go to church. They could vote. And all these basic rights that we take for granted. And they came to America. And I can still recall. Some are now presidents, like Lech Walesa. Some are leaders of their party. As they came to our offices — and I'm certain it was two in every other office — they didn't ask for money."", ""They wanted to come to America to see America. They wanted to take a look at America. And I can recall almost everyone who left my office, sometimes with tears streaming down their cheeks saying, we want to be like America. We are the envy of the world. That's why so many people want to be like we are."", ""So we have lit liberty's torch with a glow that can truly light the world. That's what America's all about. We're much more than a place on a map. We're the United States. We're a beacon of hope. We're a magnet for the oppressed and a shield against those who would put the soul itself in bondage. I think we did that in Kuwait."", ""And we may be called on to do it again. But I would guess the one thing I would hope when they catalogue all the amendments and all the bills and do all the commentary is that whenever it's all over for us here, that we've left our children something other than a legacy of debt."", ""DOLE: And our children are important, and none of us have a perfect solution. But there's got to be some solution where we can come together — Republicans and Democrats — because everybody loves their children. Everybody loves their grandchildren. We have all these young pages here. We have an example every day of young people who want to get ahead, who are willing to work, they just want the opportunity. And I think if I could hope that anything might happen — probably won't happen today, but this year, next year."", ""And I felt strongly about the balanced budget but not enough people did. But that'll be around. And so I would close with, again, thanking all of my colleagues."", ""I don't believe — just trying to think back — I don't think we've ever had any real disagreements. I remember one time the Democratic leader -that I offered an amendment that you thought you were going to offer. And I made a mistake. I wasn't trying one-up the senator from South Dakota, so I withdrew my amendment. And he offered the amendment. I think that's called civility."", 'So I would close with my hero Dwight Eisenhower.

But in any event, this is his quote: ""As we peer into society\'s future, we — you, and I, and our government — must avoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering for our own ease and convenience the precious resources of tomorrow. We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss of their political and spiritual heritage. We want democracy to survive for all generations to come. Not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow.""', 'And I think those words are just as good today as they were 35 years ago when President Eisenhower spoke them.', ""We can lead or we can mislead as the people's representatives.

This increase, the largest tax increase in world history, was passed by the Democrat-controlled Congress in August of 1993.', ""I'm proud to say that every Republican in the House and Senate opposed this staggering increase. We opposed it because we believe that Americans are already overtaxed. And the sad fact is that after three and a half years of the Clinton administration, you are more overtaxed than ever before."", ""Many of you have probably heard about Tax Freedom Day. It's the day when the average American has finally earned enough to pay all his tax bills and the day when you stop working for the government and start working for yourself."", 'When President Clinton took office, Tax Freedom Day was April 30th. This year Tax Freedom Day was May 7. This means that the Clinton administration has condemned Americans to work seven more dayt each year for the government.', 'Under President Clinton, taxes now are so highest, according to the National Tax Foundation, the typical American family pays more in federal, state and local taxes than it spends on food, clothing and housing combined.', 'In November of 1994, you said enough is enough. You gave Republicans control of Congress, and you asked us to reduce taxes so you could spend more or invest more of your hard-earned money as you saw fit. We Republicans heard that message loud and clear, and we did just as you asked.', ""To put more money in the pockets of America's families, Republicans passed a $500 per child tax credit. As one father of 10 children told me in Jacksonville, Florida, that credit would mean he would have an additional $5,000 to spend on food, clothing and medical bills for his children."", ""To ensure that widows aren't forced to sell the family business or farm just to pay the tax bill, Republicans also reduce the estate tax. To help our families, Republicans also reduced the so-called marriage penalty tax and created a tax credit for expenses associated with the adoption of a child."", ""And we created a tax credit for expenses associated with long-term care of seriously ill spouses or family members. And in order to create more jobs and more opportunity, Republicans reduced the capital gains tax rate. Why aren't you receiving the benefits of these tax cuts?"", ""Why aren't these tax cuts the law of the land? One simple reason -because President Clinton vetoed each and every one of them. There will be a lot of talk about taxes in the months ahead, and some of it may get confusing at times. But here are two facts that all the rhetoric in the world cannot change."", ""Fact number one: In 1993, nearly every Democrat in the House and Senate supported President Clinton's tax increase, the largest in history, and every — every Republican opposed it."", 'Fact number two: In 1995, every Republican in the House and the Senate supported historic package of tax reductions. Nearly every Democrat opposed it, and President Clinton vetoed it.', 'And let me share another fact. Along with President Reagan, I was honored to lead the successful fight for the largest tax reduction in American history and for the most comprehensive simplification of our tax system in history. I continue to believe that along with reducing tax rates, we must also aggressively reduce tax rules and regulations.', ""It's estimated that last year alone American taxpayers spent 1.8 billion hours filling out their tax forms. Businesses spent twice as much time sending the IRS over one million reports."", 'The IRS was never meant to an intrusive, oppressive presence in American life. But as the tax code has grown ever more complex, as the agency has swelled to more than 100,000 people, costing taxpayers nearly $10 billion a year, tax collectors have grown more and more high-handed.', 'Today, there are more investigators working for the IRS than for the Drug Enforcement Administration.', ""DOLE: I believe it's high time for a fairer, flatter and simpler system. I believe it's time for the 1040 form to go the way of the Berlin Wall. I believe you should be able to file your tax return on postcard or electronically without paper at all. And above all, I'm guided by the belief that our tax code should recognize that a family's most important responsibility is raising children and not supporting the bureaucracy in Washington, D.C."", 'Finally, let me say that Elizabeth and I join with all of you in sending our thoughts and prayers to those in the path of Hurricane Bertha. When disaster strikes, Americans always respond with kindness and generosity.

Traditionally, Minnesota tends to be at the top of the states in terms of high school graduation rates, percentage of students going on to higher education and in terms of test scores of college bound students.', 'Over the years in Minnesota, we have innovated programs that expand student and parent choice. We allow our high school students to take college courses. We have developed student choice among public schools.', ""And we started the nation's first, innovative charter schools."", 'Now, these were positive changes and they produced positive results. Now, as a state, we could rest on those laurels. But we chose not to. We chose, instead, to look at the job realities of tomorrow and to upgrade the requirements for high school graduation. we decided to test not only college bound students but also those that not anticipating on to higher education. And frankly, the results were alarming.', 'For instance, right here in the twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, a majority of our students failed 9th grade Math and English. And sadly, we know that if current projections continue, a majority of our students will drop out before they complete high school.', 'That is not acceptable.', 'Education, for centuries, has been at the heart of the American Dream. It defines who we are, what we are and where we are going.', 'Millions of people migrated to America understanding what freedom and opportunity were all about. That was their vision for this nation.', ""Those immigrants that went to Kansas and they made the rough Kansas prairie parts of the world's bread basket."", 'CARLSON: And the sweat of those immigrants took the great forests of Minnesota and made Minnesota one of the most diverse, economic successes in this nation.', 'And they poured into the great cities of the East coast and they built opportunity, they built freedom and they built success.', 'Education, more than any one, single component defines American success. A society that allows half its children to fail is not a successful society.', '[applause]', 'My parents migrated to the United States from Sweden. They were poor. And as a family, we lived in the Bronx of New York City. But they understood what opportunity was all about. And they understood that education was at the heart of opportunity. And when I was given a scholarship to a private school, it let me know, a kid from the Bronx, what opportunity was all about.', 'And I know that the President and Mrs. Clinton and the Vice President and Mrs. Gore have spent considerable time defining success for their children. They chose, and I support their choice, to send their children to good, private schools in Washington, D.C.', '[applause]', 'As parents, they wanted their children to have an opportunity to succeed.

That's what this campaign is all about."", '[applause]', 'DOLE: And probably no issue is as central to restoring the dream as the education of our children.', 'A few issues offer such major choices to the American people this November.

Yet, over our public schools hangs an air of failure, frustration and futility. And what makes this so tragic, is that once not so long ago, America's public schools were places of learning and order. They were a model to the world where kids of all classes and all races and all creeds were brought together. And for many of us, a quality education at public school was a first big break we had."", 'The schools instilled ambition and hope and discipline and decency and a common love would for our country and what is stands for.', 'But I was looking around the audience I said I think know this guy.

And no one has spoken more fervently about saving our schools than Bill Clinton did back in 1992 when he came to Minnesota and all around the country as candidate. Yet his years in office have been the low point in American public education.', 'In every possible way, we have done worse.', ""SAT scores haven't gone up in more than a decade. And last year, of course, they were artificially boosted 100 points. But the dropout rate among college freshman was higher last year than any time in our history, higher last year than any time in our history."", ""And America, don't misunderstand me, still has some of the finest teachers in the world. Make no mistake about it, we have the finest teachers in the world."", 'DOLE: And one of the biggest academic movements in our colleges is remedial education.

Think about it.', 'This is our dividend on billions and billions of dollars invested in education: lower test scores, a higher dropout rate, massive remedial education, and an illiteracy rate growing by leaps and bounds.', 'And poor performance in many of our elementary and secondary classrooms is a key reason why real wages have been stagnant in recent years. We know from common sense that better skills, and more know how are directly tied to higher wages and growing salaries and better opportunities for young people.', ""That's why I have decided ..."", '[applause]', ""That's why I have decided to make education an essential part of my pro-growth economic plan. We're talking about it here today. We'll be talking about it tomorrow in Milwaukee. We'll be talking about it again Cleveland on Friday."", 'Because as I view it, and as I see it, as we get the economy ready for the next century, education ranks right up there with tax reform and regulatory reform and all the other priorities we ought to have in American.', 'And at the center that afflicts our school is a denial of free choice. Our public schools are in trouble because too often they are no longer run by the public. Instead they are controlled by narrow special interest groups who regard public education not as a public trust, but as political territory to be guarded at all costs, not the public trust.', 'Now the president says he wants reform.

You can't do both."", '[applause]', 'You cannot be a leader in education, and at the same time be the pliant pet of militant teachers unions who are fighting reform.', '[applause]', ""DOLE: That's like showing up at a fire with a flame thrower instead of hose it doesn't work."", '[applause]', 'And I was talking about this with Secretary Bennett and Secretary Alexander on the way out from Washington this morning.', ""We've got to make this distinction."", ""Under this administration, only the producers of education have a voice. We're always hearing from the unions and bureaucrats with their armies of lawyers and lobbyists, but who speaks for the consumers? Who speaks for the parents? They don't have political action committees like those who bankroll the Clinton campaign. They can't afford to cut big checks for candidates who do their biding.

Every student has a right to be safe in school, that's number one."", '[applause]', ""And in my view, and I know the secretaries are experts on this, it's just staggering to hear some of our education experts today object to basic standards of discipline in the name of children's rights. You can't do it because it offends their rights."", ""President Clinton's expressed concern about the problem of violent and interruptive students. But every time someone proposes clear standards of discipline, his supporters and the unions have fought it tooth and nail."", ""Now meanwhile, studies show over 5,000 teachers are attacked each month in our nation's schools.

And if necessary, my Justice Department will be ready to assist school districts in legal challenges to effective and proven codes."", '[applause]', 'And we must also ensure that solid and meaningful subjects are taught in our schools. One study found that is the typical American student only spends about 40 percent of study on academic subjects.', ""Students in other developed countries spend nearly all their class time on the basics.

To get in touch with your feelings.', '[applause]', ""And even when they do teach the basics, many of our educators today display an amazing gift for making simple things complicated. Let's take reading. You and I just about everyone else learned to read by the phonics method — at least we did in Russell, Kansas."", ""First we learned our ABC'S. It took a while. Then we learned to match sounds with letters. And soon we could write simple sentences. Before long we new English."", ""Now, phonics isn't fancy or intricate, but it works and has for hundreds of years. But along came our modern education experts and suddenly phonics is being discarded. In its place we have something called the whole language method. It's very interesting. It's very sophisticated, very new and exciting. The only problem is it doesn't work."", '[laughter]', ""And they've been trying it ..."", '[applause]', ""Let me tell you — give you an example. They have trying it in California's public schools, and as a result California now has some of the lowest reading levels in America. And they are going to change it in California.

And all those poor parents ask was a chance to start making choices of their own.', 'To bring a little life and competition and freedom into the Washington school system. But the national education association said, no.', 'DOLE: And faced with choice between these lobbies for status quo versus the president and the children, the president sided with the lobbyists as he has done every time.', ""And I say it's time the federal government started standing up for the parents and standing up for the children and standing up for the taxpayers of America. That is basic, a basic difference."", '[applause]', 'We need a president that is willing to extend tax breaks to lobbyists and more willing to show them a little backbone.

I really believe all Americans will have school choice some day.', ""But we're already having something called voters choice."", ""First we have to have voters choice. See what the voters think about Bill Clinton's education record come the 5th of November. And before the age of big government, the public school system, as I said earlier, was based on freedom and common sense. On a belief in standards and ability that children to meet the standards. And perhaps above all, on trusting parents who do the right thing for their children."", 'You know what? The system worked.', ""And it can work again with such innovations as competency testing for teachers and an education consumers warranty that outlines what all American families should expect from the system: a safe school, the ability to learn the three R's through proven methods and to acquire an understanding of American history and our democratic values, freedom from needless bureaucracy and red tape, the right to know whether the meet is meetings its obligations, a diploma that signifies readiness for college or a job and the ability to choose the school that's right for them."", 'When I am president of the United States, the education consumers, you the parents, and the consumers warranty will be guarded by leaders who know the territory.', 'I have asked Bill Bennett and Lamar Alexander to identify current federal laws and regulations and executive orders and spending programs and court decisions that violate the consumers education warranty. And they will find these roadblocks, and together-we will knock them down one after another until they are gone, gone forever in America, the roadblocks are gone.', '[applause]', ""So without a warranty, let's remember the importance of parental involvement and parental responsibility.

This legislation offers a strong, effective, bipartisan solution that will given states the freedom and the flexibility to address their unique local needs. I have ever confidence that the Senate will also complete action on a similar tough bill.

Beginning today, the hard work and perseverance of many members of the United States team will be rewarded with Olympic medals.

It's a challenge that involves saving young lives."", ""I would ask that all these outstanding athletes unite in a common mission of using part of their moment in the spotlight to tell America's kids that drug use is wrong and that drugs kill. That's a message that must be repeated again and again — not just by Olympic athletes but by all of us, if we are to stop the alarming increase in drug use by America's youth."", ""I've often said that fighting drugs should not be a partisan issue. After all, a drug dealer does not ask our children whether his parents are Democrats or Republicans before he tries to peddle his poison."", ""The sad fact is, however, that the war on drugs will be tougher to win because of three years of misguided policies of the Clinton administration. It will be tougher to win because one of the president's first actions was to cut the staff of the Office of National Drug Policy by 80 percent. It will be tougher to win because ineffective efforts to keep drugs from crossing our border and reaching our shores have increased the supply of drugs while decreasing the price."", ""It will be tougher to win because a dangerous message was sent to our kids by President Clinton's surgeon general who vocally supported legalization of certain drugs. It will be tougher to win because this administration's Justice Department has dramatically decreased the number of new federal drug prosecutions."", 'These and other actions led New York Democrat Congressman Charles Rangel, one of America\'s most respected antidrug crusaders, to say — and I quote — ""I have been in Congress for over two decades, and I have never, never, never found any administration that has been so silent on this great challenge to the American people.""', 'We are now reaping a shameful harvest for this silence.

LSD use has now reached the highest rates since record-keeping started in 1975. Methamphetamine use is up 321 percent since 1991. The number of cocaine-and heroin-related emergency room admissions has jumped to historic levels."", 'And a recent study reported that despite the fact that a number of popular recording artists have recently died of heroin overdoses, only half of those aged 12 to 17 understand the dangers of trying that deadly drug.', 'DOLE: Regaining the ground lost these past years will not be easy. But the sharp decline in drug use in America during the Reagan and Bush administrations is proof that it can be done.', ""Turning the tide will require the appointment of no-nonsense judges who'll require increased resources for our law enforcement community. It will requiring penalizing instead of rationalizing the behavior of those who use or sell drugs. It will require making clear to all countries that good relations and trade with the United States depend upon serious efforts to stop drug exports cold."", ""And as I said at the beginning, it will require the concerted efforts of all those who influence America's children — parents, teachers, religious leaders, athletes, public officials and those in the entertainment industry. A message that drugs are OK, are harmless fun, a message that has been seen in television and movies and heard in popular music on an increasing basis recently, is a message should not and must not tolerate."", 'We should also not forget our responsibility to let our kids know of the dangers posed by tobacco and alcohol.', ""Unfortunately, no one awards medals for helping kids make the right choices.

We want to protect food, water, all these things that should be protected, but we need to bring a little common sense into the problem. Regulations cost the average family in America about $6,000 per year. And some are necessary. Don't misunderstand me."", ""But many of the regulations are promulgated by people who've never visited a plant, never visited a farm. But they do it.

And we think that's right, but why not give that same choice to everybody else in America?"", ""It seems to me if it's good enough for some who are in positions of power or prestige, it ought to be good enough for everybody in America, because education is the most important thing you can give your child. And we're going to see that it happens. And we have Governor Wilson's support in California. And we have the support of governors — Republicans and Democrats — pretty much across the country.

You're all taxpayers and paying taxes goes with a free country and a free America. We are the leader of the free world, whether we like it or not. And we have certain responsibilities."", ""But in my view, there's adequate room for change. We can reduce taxes. We can reduce the burden on you and your family."", 'DOLE: We can put more money into your paycheck, and that will be one of the defining differences in this campaign between candidate Bob Dole and candidate Bill Clinton.

He'll tell you, oh, he's going to fix it and Republicans are to blame. But the bottom line is we need economic growth in this country. We need to create more jobs."", ""The growth rate's only been 2.3 percent that last three years, the lowest peacetime economic growth in the last 30 to 40 years, and we can do better."", 'It ought to be at least 3.5 percent.

Nothing but benefits will flow if we rely on growth, opportunity, lower taxes, less regulations.', ""And if we want to make America competitive, as you are competitive, other opportunities, other industries competitive , then we've got to get the job done. And that's why we're in San Diego, where Governor Wilson was former mayor for 12 years."", ""We came to San Diego because we believe that we can launch a campaign in San Diego that's not going be heard just across America. It will be heard around the world. The American people want fundamental change. They want us to stop spending so much of their money."", '[applause]', 'And there\'s another convention going on in this state, and I would just say, ""Mr. Perot, we are the reform party.

""Well, you didn\'t ask me.""', 'So I want to conclude by asking everyone in this audience, I would like to have your vote.

I'm very proud of America as everyone in this room is. We all love America. Some of us have been priviledged to serve in some branch of the armed services for America. We learned a lot about our fellow man in the service. I remember going to Russell, Kansas to Brooklyn College. That was a big, that's a stretch. Quite an experience. And then I remember Louisiana and then I remember several other places in Texas and other places."", 'But I remember most of all, a group that I joined in Italy and they get in the Tenth mountain division, not when I joined the tenth, but initially to get into the Tenth mountain division, you had to have letters of recommendation — believe it or not, two.

Some even made money which is legal in America.', ""It was better before Clinton. You didn't pay as much in taxes but we're going to change all that.

There is sort of a camaraderie. There is a bond. There's something about serving your country. And not everybody can, don't misunderstand me."", ""But there's something about serving your country that sort of brings us together. We can be from Brooklyn and Russell, Kansas; or we can be from Mississippi and Seattle, and we can appreciate each other. Different backgrounds, different economic backgrounds, different ethnic backgrounds, different racial backgrounds."", ""And one thing we learned very quickly in the service is that we're there for one purpose. And that's to serve America. And, as I'll say Thursday night, when something happened and somebody lost their life or somebody was seriously wounded, it was American blood that was shed, American blood that we shed."", ""We didn't look at their race; we didn't look at their background. They were Americans. And they shed their blood and gave their lives and lost their..."", '[applause]', ""They're Americans."", '[applause]', ""And that's really the strength of this country.

The time for such risk is long overdue.', 'And in defending our nation from external threats, the requirements of survival cannot merely be finessed. There is no room for margin of error. On this subject perhaps more than any other, a president must level with the people and be prepared to take political risks.

It would have created 5O brand new federal bureaucracies, countless new laws and federal penalties, and put one-seventh of the U.S. economy under government control. In only the second year of operation it would have dwarfed almost every other program."", 'Maybe worst of all, the Clinton plan gave the federal government a role in nearly every health care decision currently made by you and your doctor.

I didn't want to give the government control over your health care. I wanted to give you more control by making the system more affordable and more accessible. I wanted to help those with pre-existing conditions. I wanted to make health insurance portable, so it could follow you from job to job. And when you gave Republicans control of Congress, that is exactly what we did."", 'Even though the President did riot succeed in putting the federal government in control of health care, he has remained committed to a bigger and more powerful federal government, By my count, he proposed nearly 500 new spending proposals in the past four years, while pushing through the largest tax increase in history. This is a textbook example of a liberal in action: New programs and bigger government paid for by higher taxes.', 'And although the President said last year that ""the era of big government is over,"" his words are not matched by his actions. His administration hints that if re-elected, the President may try to resurrect his nationalized health care proposal. Indeed, Mrs. Clinton, the architect of the proposal. told reporters this summer that the Clinton plan was — quote — ""still the right model.""

Violence must not be rewarded. Therefore, the most important objective at the present time is to end the violence -- unconditionally. I was disappointed that President Clinton\'s statement did not include an unequivocal condemnation of the recent violence. Of course, Israel and Palestinians will continue to negotiate -- as they must. As the Washington Summit demonstrated, the United States cannot impose a solution.

But this Clinton foreign money scandal is not politics as usual. Taken together, these actions are a singular and serious betrayal of the public trust. We cannot accept that this kind of activity is normal or permissible in America without diminishing the ideals of America itself."", ""The President's silence on these issues of public trust is a form of admission. And our silence would be a form of permission. But that is permission we must never give.

79,            Robert Dole          ,"October 21, 1996","['Thank you very much and I have an opportunity to watch you on CROSSFIRE from time to time. And you always win. You always win. No problem about it.', ""And I want to say to everybody here, including the people who work here, you know, this is our country. Democrats, Republicans or independents, it's our country."", ""We're very proud of it. We want to make it better. We want to create more opportunities and more jobs in the private sector. That's what it's all about."", ""Michigan is a very important state or other states that are represented here. Illinois, Ohio, Mississippi, Iowa, South Carolina, Kansas. I think we're all right in Kansas. We're all right in South Carolina. I just heard this morning too."", ""But, in any event, the election's about two weeks from now. And a lot of people haven't focused. In fact, I was surprised that only about 35 to 40 million watched the second debate."", ""This was compared to about 90 million who watched the Bush-Clinton-Perot debate in 1992. So, maybe there's no interest in politics. Maybe nobody cares or maybe they're just getting around to focus on it and they're beginning to make up their minds because there's a lot of movement out there."", ""We see the polls go up and down and up and down. And they can't all be right and they can't all be wrong. Probably, somewhere in the middle. But, I wanted to express to this group whether you're, as I said, a Democrat or a Republican or an Independent or just came to wrong meeting. There are always one or two who get into the wrong meeting."", '[laughter]', ""This is about you. It's about your job. It's about your business. It's about your family. It's about your community. It's about your state. It's about your country."", ""Now, President Clinton will tell you, and he's a great talker, I've had a chance to spend a couple 90-minute segments with him, and he does a good job. He goes right past the facts. The facts never get in the way of President Clinton."", ""He created all the jobs. He took two million people off welfare rolls. I thought you did the Governor Fordice, and other governors. He doesn't take people..."", ""In any event, I think he gets a lot credit for things that haven't happened. He doesn't want any credit for this foreign aid that's coming to America. Finally, we're getting foreign aid in America. From Indonesia and other countries."", '[laughter]', '[applause]', ""And it's all coming to America. I didn't think I'd live long enough to see us get foreign aid. The trouble is it's all going to the Democratic Party. In any event, that's another story."", ""If we're going to get America moving, we need to do what Jack Kemp and I have prescribed. Again, this is sound. Oh, I've listened to all the people that say, but Bob Dole had his reputation as a deficit hawk. And I still do."", ""I'm a deficit hawk. Jack Kemp is a supply sider. We both recognize to make this work, to make it work in the right way, we have to cut spending. If we're going to reduce taxes, we need to balance the budget."", ""And on this package, we do both. We balance the budget by the year 2002. We do this without touching Social Security or Medicare, of course, interest on the debt you can't touch."", ""And we don't think we ought to touch Defense. We think President Clinton has already cut Defense too much."", '[applause]', ""So, I want to make it clear to senior citizens here. I don't see any, but if anybody comes in or if you know a senior citizen — oh, there is one, one right — we're not going to touch Medicare. Medicare's going to grow 39 percent under our plan."", ""Social Security 34 percent under our plan. And I know there have been a lot ads run about how Bob Dole doesn't like Medicare. Bob Dole doesn't like veterans. Bob Dole doesn't like anybody. There's nobody left. We don't like anybody which makes it a little bit more difficult to get a big, big landslide."", '[laughter]', ""But in any event, we're working on it. We like people. We like Democrats. My parents were the greatest people I ever... They were Democrats and they were great people."", ""In fact, I'm finding out on the rope lines — now, I don't know if Jack is. But, I was in Denver, Colorado where four different — they were scattered — four different women said I'm a Democrat, but I'm going to vote for you. So, the people are beginning to listen."", ""It's not a Republican election or Democratic election. It's an election for the president of United States by Democrats, independents and Republicans."", ""DOLE: And we're reaching out to people everywhere we can. Getting tangled up here and I'm going to fall off the stage again."", '[laughter]', ""I don't know anybody saw that out in Chico, California. But, on the way down, my cell phone rang, as I've said, and it was a trial lawyer saying boy, I think we got a case here Bob. But, in any event, those are some of frivolous lawsuits we're trying to prevent."", ""Put a lot of businessmen and business women out of business. So, I would just say to everybody here, it's an honor to be back in Michigan."", ""I've spent a lot of life in Michigan — different places, Battle Creek for couple of three years after World War II at Percy Jones Hospital. So, I know a little about the state and I've been coming up since. And I know what a great job your governor's done."", ""As Roger said when you cut taxes 21 times, you create some opportunities, you create some activity in the private sector. I'm told by friend Wayne Angell, former member of the Fed, there are $7 trillion in assets locked up out there. Seven trillion dollars."", ""And we get letters day after day after day saying, I would like to do something. I'd like to expand my business or whatever. But, we can't do it because of the capital gains rate. So, we're going to cut it in half."", 'Cut it 50 percent from 28 percent to 14. That is a start. That would create lots of jobs in the private sector. A lot of activity in the private sector.', ""So, I just say to people who ask me about this election, I say just line us up. Take a look at Bill Clinton's record. He's already in his second term."", ""His first two years, he was a liberal. That was one term. So, he had one term as a liberal. Then something happened and people said, wait we've had enough of that, we don't want our health care taken over by the government."", ""We don't want 17 new taxes and price controls and 50 new bureaucracies. And we don't want to spend $1.5 trillion to ruin our health care system. And you promised us a tax cut, Mr. President and you gave us the biggest tax increase in history."", ""He's says, well, only 1.1 percent of the rich pay it. Seventy percent of those taxes are paid by small businessmen and small business women in Michigan and across the country."", 'Senior citizens got their Social Security taxes hiked. Thirty-two billion dollars tax increase in gasoline, not for highways, but to go into some fund where they can take it and play with and spend it wherever they want.', 'So, take a look at that first term, the first two-year term as governors have in New Hampshire. He had one two-year term. Then, Republicans took over the House and the Senate.', 'And suddenly, President Clinton became something else. He was no longer the liberal. Well, what happens, if he gets re-elected unrestrained by another election? Will we see health care again, see more tax increases, or will you have these targeted tax cuts that he talks about?', ""What is a targeted tax cut? Do you have to follow the rules of the government? If you do that, if you're good little boys and girls, eat your vegetables, and do all the things the president wants you to do, then you get a little tax cut."", ""We don't believe that's the way to go. We ought to have an across-the-board tax cut. Everybody's treated the same in America in the Dole/Kemp tax plan."", '[applause]', ""That blast of hot air reminded me of my days in the Senate. But, in any event... So, I better sit down here before I get carried away. The record in the Senate is held by Senator Thurmond, as you know. Twenty-four hours and 17 minutes he talked without interruption. That's why we didn't bring him along today because we knew we had a long program. But, he's going to be re-elected big time in South Carolina."", ""So, I want to conclude with this. It's the economic package. It's foreign policy which we didn't have an opportunity to go into in our debate in San... Didn't have many — there was only one foreign policy question."", ""Look around the world since President Clinton has been there. First, they turn it all over to the United Nations. That was called assertive, multi-lateralism. That's what they called it."", ""Let the U.N. make decisions. We'll send the troops or we'll send the money. We've got to worry about the economy. So, we did that in Somalia until 18 young Americans were killed and some dragged through the streets. And then we pulled out of Somalia."", ""We repeated that everywhere we've been. We made a big, big mistake in Bosnia. We promised — it was a candidate to lift the arms embargo if the Muslims defend themselves. Then, he changed his mind when he became president. So, we had to send twenty some thousand Americans to Bosnia."", ""Well, they're supposed to be coming back by the end of the year. But, now it appears, it will be some time next year. You go right around the world, we haven't had a real foreign policy."", ""In fact, Secretary Christopher being the very honest man that he is, says that it really took him quite awhile to understand the importance of America's leadership. Well, if you didn't know that going in, you got a problem."", ""DOLE: So, I want to say, again, this is a great opportunity. Michigan is a very key state and so are the other states represented here by governors. We're going to be in all those states because we believe the American people are beginning to focus."", ""Jack gave me some good advice about a month ago. He said, don't watch the scoreboard. If you watch the scoreboard, then somebody's going to fumble. It might be the quarterback or it might be the running back. Whatever role we're playing these days."", '[laughter]', ""So, we've got a great team. Dole/Kemp. They're two four-letter words you can teach your kids. Dole/Kemp, Dole/Kemp."", '[applause]', ""That's right. All right. Plus, they're two four-letter words that mean leadership. Leadership, honesty, keeping your word. Keeping your word is important, at least, it used to be."", ""Maybe, we'll find out in a couple of weeks. Maybe, it's not important any more. Maybe, just go out and say what you have to say to get elected. In fact, you remember during the San Diego debate — and I don't want to keep going back to that — but, the president got up and said you shouldn't listen to these candidates who promise you a tax cut right before the election."", ""He did it in '92. I mean, I couldn't believe it. I was right there in the room. And he said it like nobody would remember what he did in 1992."", 'Got to keep your word.', ""In my little town, that's all you did. You had your word. You didn't have a contract. You didn't sign anything. You said Ok or no and that was it. Your word was your bond."", ""And that's the way it's going to be when Bob Dole and Jack Kemp are sworn in next January."", '[applause]', ""And let me say... And I know each of the governors sort of spell out what they've done in their states to make it work whether it's $200 million tax cut in South Carolina, whether it's tort reform in Illinois. Whatever it is, they're changing the landscape out there. They're bringing the government closer to the people."", ""And I would conclude by saying, that I carry in my pocket, a copy of the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution. It's been around over 200 years. It's only 28 words in length. It simply says, that unless the federal Constitution gives the power to the federal government or denies it to the states, it belongs to the states. And more importantly, it belongs to the people."", '[applause]', ""Now, our founding fathers did that 200 years ago. And they did it. You talk about wisdom. They had it. You know what they were afraid of? They were afraid of this all-powerful central government. They didn't know about the Republican Party or Bob Dole or Bill Clinton or Ross Perot or anybody else."", ""They were worried about an all-powerful central government that got so powerful, it could strip your rights away through taxation or not compensate you for private property they might be taking. That's what they were concerned about. This all-powerful central government."", ""And there isn't a person here, regardless of your party, who wouldn't agree that there's been too much power shifted to the federal government. Why not send it back to these outstanding governors we have here today?"", ""Democratic and Republican governors, legislators, welfare reform is finally going to come back. But, the president said he's going to change it next year, if he's there."", ""Medicaid ought to come back. Block grants and all these education — some of these education — and training programs ought to come back to the governors. Every opportunity we have. Why? Because it's closer to the people."", ""It's closer to the people and I have a lot of confidence in America's governors. They know what to do. They're here everyday. They understand the people. They understand the state better than any bureaucrat, Republican or Democrat, in some agency somewhere in Washington, D.C."", ""So, we're going to work on that along with our economic package. Send more power back to the states and back to the people. So, the people will have an opportunity to participate — not just to keep paying taxes, and keep saying yes or keep complaining — where you actually can participate. And for all those reasons."", ""Again, I am honored to be here and I'd ask for your support. We're going to win this election. He's going to be the most — I'm the most optimistic man in America. And Clinton will be the surprised man in America on November 6, 1996."", '[applause]', 'Thank you. All right.']"

85,            Robert Dole          ,"October 22, 1996","[""Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole today released the following statement in response President Clinton's speech in Detroit:"", '""Bill Clinton was in Detroit today campaigning. Campaign time means that it\'s time for Bill Clinton to make promises, or, in the case of NATO enlargement, renew the promises he has not kept. Of course, Bill Clinton is hoping that everyone -- in particular, Americans of Central and Eastern European descent -- will think that his Detroit speech is news -- and not the re-run it really was.', '""Bill Clinton said that NATO must \'take in new members.\' This is not news. It is the same shop-worn message -- just another photo-op. Clinton said it back at the 1994 NATO Summit. Nothing has happened -- just meetings and speeches, and of course, photo-ops. He still refuses to name the countries which will be welcomed to join NATO. Moreover, Clinton did not outline a timetable for enlargement. He only said that the first countries invited to join \'should be\' full fledged members of NATO by 1999.', '""\'Should be\' is not American leadership and that is the reason NATO enlargement has not yet occurred. And, make no mistake, Bill Clinton had the opportunity and the ability to make enlargement a reality during his administration. But why should we be surprised? After all, it is this administration\'s Secretary of State who said that he did not realize \'how essential U S. leadership\' is to the conduct of American foreign policy.', '""The only thing Clinton\'s remarks on NATO make clear is that he is still waffling and still unwilling to assert American leadership in NATO. Under Bill Clinton, NATO enlargement will never happen.', '""The contrast between Bob Dole and Bill Clinton on this critical issue couldn\'t be clearer. Earlier year, I named Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary as the countries who should be invited to join NATO now. I set 1998 as the target date for a NATO summit in Prague to welcome these countries into the Alliance. Before I left the Senate, I introduced the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act to facilitate and speed up the process. There should be no doubt that I am committed to American leadership within NATO. My pledges have been matched by action. When I am President I will make sure that NATO enlargement is reality and not rhetoric. During his speech, Bill Clinton did something else he does so well -- re-write his own record, this time in the area of foreign policy.', '""Amazingly, Bosnia topped this morning\'s list of false triumphs. For three years, Clinton watched what he called \'the bloodiest war in Europe since World War II\' -- and failed to keep his promise to arm the Bosnians. Yes, elections have been held, but they were un-free, unfair and corrupt. This sham process simply legitimized extremists -- Bosnian Serb parliamentary representatives and the Bosnian Serb member of the three-man presidency promptly refused to take the oath of office. Meanwhile, most of the more than two million refugees still cannot return home. And President Clinton\'s pledge to arm and train Bosnian forces -- the realistic exit strategy for American forces -- has not been fulfilled.', '""Haiti is another so-called Clinton \'success.\' Since when are death squads -- rooted in the American-trained so-called security force -- a sign of success? If the Clinton White House is so proud of its Haiti record, it should not have refused to turn over the 47 documents which a House of Representatives committee recently requested.', '""North Korea was also on Clinton\'s success list this morning. While Clinton confidently declared that North Korea \'has frozen\' its nuclear program, he cannot know that because his deal with the North Koreans does not provide for the reestablishment of full inspections as required by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The American public must be reminded, however, that Clinton\'s deal did reward North Korean treaty violations with oil and two nuclear reactors worth billions of dollars -- paid for in part by the American taxpayer -- that will ultimately produce more plutonium than the reactor that is supposedly frozen.', '""With respect to nonproliferation, Clinton claims to have reduced the threat of weapons of mass destruction. Russian missiles that Clinton claims are no longer targeted at the United States -- which cannot be verified -- can be re-targeted in a very short time. More frightening, this morning\'s Washington Times reported that the CIA has concluded that control over Russia\'s nuclear arsenal is growing weaker and a political crisis could lead to an unauthorized nuclear missile launch. Moreover, there is no evidence that countries like Iran, Iraq, Libya, and North Korea are reducing their efforts to acquire or develop nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons and the means to deliver them. In fact, it is just the opposite. The Clinton Administration is acquiescing to Saddam Hussein\'s defiance of nuclear weapons and missiles inspections. All this highlights why Bill Clinton\'s refusal to develop and deploy a national missile defense system is inexcusable and irresponsible.""', '--Bob Dole']"

If you don't care, you can keep what you have. But I think most Americans care."", '[applause]', 'And I believe the current administration is out of touch with the problems in America — the average Americans. I also believe that and have always believed that the government is too big and spends too much of your money.', '[applause]', 'Too much of your money.', ""And I'll bet it represented here today in many families today, one parent works full-time just to take care of the family, the other has to work full time just to pay the taxes."", 'Because 40 percent of what you make on average, 38.2, more than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined is paid for taxes.', ""Now, both parents want to work that's, fine. But they shouldn't have to work. We're finding more and more women going back to work because they have to pay the taxes — about 20 percent. Wages are stagnant. Women's wages are down. Men's wages are almost even."", ""We're not in a good recovery. We have the worst economic growth in this century, as Connie Mack knows, the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee.

And let me give credit where credit is due. A lot of the work done on our plan was done by Senator Connie Mack, and we're happy to have him here."", '[applause]', ""It's called a 15 percent across the board tax cut."", '[applause]', ""And every child under 18 behind me is a $500 credit. You can do a lot with a $500 credit. And to make the economy grow, we're going to cut the capital gains rate in half, 50 percent, right down the middle."", '[applause]', ""Now, why are we doing that? Well, it's very simple — it's your money. It's your money. It's not my money. It's not President Clinton's money. Oh, and he says, oh, the government can't afford it. Now, did the government come out and talk to you before they raised taxes in 1993? No."", '[boos]', ""And the president will come here — I think he's in Florida today somewhere, trying to scare senior citizens. He's somewhere out there. And it's not even Halloween. Wait until Halloween."", ""He will tell you that the government can't afford it. He will tell you that the largest tax increase in history — his — only touched 1.1 percent of the American people. That's not true, Mr. President. Seventy percent of those taxes were paid by small business men and small business women."", ""He also raised taxes $28 billion on senior citizens, on their Social Security. We're going to repeal that tax, Mr. President."", '[applause]', ""Now, he wants your family to pinch pennies. I've got a better idea. Let's have the government pinch pennies for a change."", '[applause]', ""And with our tax plan, a family of four making $30,000 a year will get about a $1,261 tax cut. That's an 86 percent tax cut, 86 percent less."", ""Now, what do you do with $1261. Well, maybe child care, maybe something else, maybe even take a vacation with your family. That's not illegal either in America. But..."", '[applause]', ""... even the president hasn't had the gall to say it's a rich man's tax cut. This is a family tax cut, this is a mainstream tax cut, this is for real Americans, working Americans."", ""And we're going to make it work, and you can count on that, you have my word — and I keep my word, that's the difference."", '[applause]', 'And let me share, I had a letter just last week from a lady in Eagan, Minnesota, and this is what she says:', '""As a young woman who works full-time and goes to school part-time, the only way that I want your help is by giving me more of my money back. Give me more of my money back so my husband and I can make decisions based on trying to get ahead. And if we had that 15 percent of the money the government takes from us, it can mean a lot of options — an option of me working part-time and going to school full-time and many other options.""', ""DOLE: It's your money. It's your money. The government certainly can afford it."", ""How do we pay for it? Somebody's going to ask, particularly the media. They're going to get the tax cut, too.

That's President Clinton."", '[applause]', ""And that's just phase I. Phase II is a flatter, fairer, simpler tax and ending the IRS as we know it."", '[applause]', 'Now let me say a word about how our plan and how the economic plan will protect vital programs like Social Security and Medicare, because I know the Democrats and organized labor have spent millions and millions and millions of dollars, about $91 million, running negative ads, attacking Bob Dole and every other Republican.', ""We do not touch Medicare. In fact, it grows 39 percent under our plan. Social Security goes 34 percent. There will be no cuts in Medicare and no senior's going to be forced off Medicare in our plan."", '[applause]', 'What we want to do is to balance the budget and increase Medicare, and we passed such a bill and the president vetoed it.', '[boos]', 'Those are the facts. And last week, the executive director of the American Association of Retired People, AARP, sent a letter to the chairman of the both parties.', ""And the letter says, Medicare is on the path to bankruptcy. That's not news to me. But it must be news to President Clinton, who's been so busy playing politics with Medicare, he doesn't have time to fix it. And we will fix it in 1997."", '[applause]', ""So let me make it clear to any senior here, or any children or grandchildren of seniors who're worrying about their parents or worried about their grandparents. Our plan increases Medicare spending about 7 percent a year, a figure backed up by the American Association of Retired People."", ""In six years, we'll have lower taxes, a balanced budget and a Medicare program you can count on, a much stronger Medicare program."", '[applause]', 'Now the scariest thing I can think of is four more years of Bill Clinton.', '[boos and applause]', ""Don't forget now. He came down as a candidate, and he's so nice, he's very nice. A good talker. And he tells you, he looks you — he walks right over the facts, he looks you in the eye and says, boy you — I'm going to give all you folks up here in this landing a middle-class tax cut. Everybody who got it ought to vote for him."", 'Nobody got it. Nobody. He gave you the biggest tax increase in history.', ""DOLE: Now he's out saying again, well, this time I really mean it."", '[laughter]', ""You know. Let me give you a little secret here. When we pass our tax cut plan, if he leaves his change of address form, he'll get the tax cut, too."", '[applause]', ""And all these seniors, about eight million of them out there, ought to keep in mind one thing. He raised your taxes on Social Security, not a single Republican voted for that. The Democrats, the liberals did that. Ted Kennedy and Bill Clinton and Tom Daschle and the other liberals in the Senate and the House, they did it to you. We didn't do it."", ""I've got a good record on Medicare and Social Security. In 1983, I helped strengthen Social Security along with Congressman Claude Pepper from Florida, who was a champion of senior citizens. And next year, I want to be known as the president who saved Medicare."", '[applause]', 'Our economic plan also includes regulatory reform. It costs the average family in America and Florida about $7,000 a year because of excessive regulations.', ""We're going to protect the air and the water and the Everglades and everything else. In fact, we've already taken steps way ahead of President Clinton on that, come to think of it. We also are going to help this broken-down legal system of ours to stop all these frivolous lawsuits that put people out of business."", '[applause]', 'I was out in California about a month-and-a-half ago, and this railing gave way and I dove in the crowd. And on the way down, my cell phone rang. And this trail lawyer says, ""Bob, I think we got a case here, you know.""', '[laughter]', ""We're going to stop some of those frivolous lawsuits that put small businessmen and businesswomen out of business. Now I know they give millions of dollars to Bill Clinton, along with the labor bosses and the Hollywood elite. That's where the money comes from. Those are not the values we're trying to protect in this campaign. Those are not the values."", '[applause]', 'And I would say one final word about Medicare. Remember what happened in Florida in 1994, when they made thousands and thousands of phone calls, the Democrats, and scared senior citizens and probably cost Jeb Bush the governorship?', ""And they're willing to go vote again."", '[applause]', 'Well, let me conclude by saying this. There are a lot of young people here today.', '[applause]', ""In fact, I don't see anybody but young people here today, huh?"", '[applause]', 'But I want to say to those behind me and those in front of me and the right or left or wherever. Another real problem we have in America, the fact that drug use has doubled in the last 45 months. Marijuana use is up 140 percent. Cocaine use 160 percent.', ""And I pledge to young people, we're going to cut that in half in our first four years. I'm not going to be AWOL like President Clinton's been AWOL in the war on drugs."", '[applause]', ""And we're not going to invite drug dealers to White House dinners either."", '[applause]', 'DOLE: Who knows what will be made public next. There only 13 days left.', '[laughter]', ""I don't know we'd ever get foreign aid in America, but suddenly foreign aid's coming in from Indonesia, from India, all over the world foreign aid."", ""Foreign aid is coming to America. Oh, boy, we finally lined up for it. But it's all going to President Clinton. That's not fair, that discriminates, that's a preference or a quota or whatever you call those things. It shouldn't happen. It's not legal either. It shouldn't happen in America."", ""So, let's just settle down here, we're going to work this out. I'm going to tell you what we're going to do."", ""We're going to carry the state of Florida. That's number one."", '[applause]', ""And when I'm elected I will not sell access to the White House."", '[applause]', ""I won't charge you to sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom."", '[applause]', ""That's one of the allegations floating around out there."", ""And I'll tell you what I mean and I'll follow through, I'll keep my word to the American people."", ""And I will respect, I'll respect the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States of America."", '[applause]', ""And I will tell the people of Jacksonville and all this area, we're going to have a strong defense when Bob Dole is president of the United States."", '[applause]', 'When I came back from World War II in a full body cast, the first place I landed was in Florida. And I know about the generosity and the kindness of people in this state.', ""This is serious business. It's not about me. It's not about Bill Clinton. It's about you and your kids when you tuck them in tonight.

90,            Robert Dole          ,"October 26, 1996","['As I travel the country and hear the concerns of women who speak to me about their values and the dreams they have for their children, it is so clear that my husband, Bob, understands what American families are facing today.', ""That's especially true when it comes to Medicare. Medicare is not only an issue on the minds of American seniors, it's something that concerns every American who wants to make sure that there is a safety net for their parents."", 'No one understands that better than Bob Dole. His mother would say to him, ""Now Bob, all I have is my Social Security and my Medicare."" And you can trust Bob to protect and preserve Medicare for your parents just as he did for his parents.', ""Of course, that's not what you hear from the Clinton campaign. For months, they've been running an ad campaign, spending tens of millions of dollars to try to frighten seniors into believing that Bob's economic plan will threaten Medicare."", ""That's not true, and the president knows it. Under Bob's plan, Medicare spending will increase 7 percent a year — almost double the rate of inflation."", ""Mrs. Clinton indicated, when she appeared before a congressional committee, that the administration's target was zero growth in Medicare spending."", 'I\'m not the only one who\'s concerned about the Democrats\' medi-scare attack on Bob\'s economic plan. Earlier this week, a USA Today editorial accused the Clinton campaign of ""demagoguing"" Medicare and misleading voters on what needs to be done to fix it.', 'The Washington Post called the Democrats effort — and again I quote — ""a campaign based on distortion and fear."" And listen to what the American Association of Retired Persons, the AARP, has to say about Medicare.', 'In a letter sent to the president a year ago, the executive director of the AARP stated that the Republican plan increased Medicare spending. Bob Dole and the Republican Congress wanted to balance the budget and increase the spending for Medicare.', 'Bill Clinton responded to both with a veto. Those are the facts.', 'Earlier this month, the executive director of the AARP sent another letter, this time to both the chairmen of the Democrat and Republican parties.', 'This letter says essentially what Bob has been telling the president and what his own advisers have been telling him for some time. Medicare is on the path to bankruptcy.', ""Bob's economic plan solves the problem before it's too late. That's the responsible thing to do. So let me make it clear to any seniors listening or any children of seniors worried about their parents."", ""Bob's economic plan increases Medicare spending by 7 percent a year. Over the next six years, Medicare benefits will rise from $5,200 to $7,100 — an increase of $1,900 per beneficiary."", ""Under Bob's plan, we will have lower taxes, a balanced budget and a Medicare program that is strong and reliable."", 'President Clinton has offered no viable alternative to save Medicare. We must act now. In 1983, Bob was a member of a commission of Democrats and Republicans given the assignment to save the Social Security system from bankruptcy.', ""Congressman Claude Pepper, a Democrat from Florida known as the champion of senior citizens, wrote Bob a letter on May 11, 1983, when their work was finished stating they could never have accomplished the monumental task of saving Social Security without Bob Dole's skills."", 'As president, Bob will appoint a similar bipartisan commission to preserve and strengthen the Medicare program because he wants to be known as the president who saved Medicare.', ""Bob Dole's word is his bond. When he makes a promise, you know it will be kept. Bob's colleagues in the United States Senate continued to put their faith and trust in him, making him the longest serving Republican leader in Senate history — 11 years."", 'Why? Because they know he\'s honest, trustworthy, a man of his word. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat senator from California, said — and I quote — ""Bob Dole\'s word is his commitment, and his commitment is a matter of honor. No, we didn\'t always agree, but even on issues where we disagreed, I always knew where I stood. And I knew I could trust his word.""', ""Trust his word. You have his word.

Just about the same."", 'So today, in America, the economy is barely afloat. Today, the White House should finally wake up and admit that its policy of higher taxes and bigger government has been dragging down our economy.', ""You can't raise taxes and make the economy grow. Somebody pays.
