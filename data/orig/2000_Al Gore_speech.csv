0,"Albert Gore, Jr. ","June 16, 1999","['To my beloved family, to Tipper, to the people of Tennessee, and all of you: I see so many who have been my friends as far back as I can remember. You have always been there for me. And I begin this journey today to be there for you.', ""Two hundred years ago this summer, at the sunrise of America's first full century, veterans of the American Revolution came here and founded Smith County."", ""In their minds' eye, the very idea of what America could become was still then a barely discernible horizon. Yet they moved toward it, convinced of its fineness, certain the distance would yield a place better than they had ever known."", 'Each of us has our own sense of the next, finer horizon.', 'Near the beginning of this century, when my mother was a child in West Tennessee, a poor girl when poor girls were not supposed to dream, she looked out on a world where women could not even vote, and saw with her heart something better: a horizon of equality, where women, as well as men, could be and do their best.', ""I'm so glad she's here on this day."", 'Halfway through this century, when my father saw that thousands of his fellow Tennesseans were forced to obey Jim Crow laws, he knew America could do better. He saw a horizon in which his black and white constituents shared the same hopes in the same world. He fought against the Southern Manifesto and for voting rights. His last election was lost -- but his conscience won. He taught me all my life that that was what really counted.', ""I miss my dad; but I know he's here in spirit."", 'Early in this decade, we set out to put America back to work. And today, the gifts that surround us are great. We have built a strong and growing economy. For many of our families, it is a time of firsts: first child to go to college, first mortgage for a first home, first regular paycheck, first grandchild.', ""Under the policies President Clinton and I have proposed, instead of the biggest deficits in history, we now have the biggest surplus in history. Instead of quadrupling our national debt, we've seen the creation of almost 19 million new jobs. Instead of a deep recession and high unemployment, America now has our strongest economy in the history of the United States."", 'We remember what it was like seven years ago. And I never, ever want to go back. America always looks forward, to the next horizon.', 'I want to keep our prosperity going - and I know how to do it. I want to do it the right way - not by letting people fend for themselves, or hoping for crumbs of compassion, but by giving people the skills and knowledge to succeed in their own right in the next century.', 'And I want to extend our prosperity to the unskilled and underprivileged, to Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta, to our farms and inner cities, to our new immigrants, y tambien en las communidades.', 'But as important as prosperity is, there is more to long for: there is a hunger and thirst for goodness among us.', ""Just visible within a generation's journey is a new horizon: a 21st Century America with stronger families, stronger communities, and a more vital democracy -- in which we live and govern according to our highest American ideals."", 'I love this country with all my heart. I love free speech. I believe in its future. And I know that with our history as our rudder and our ideals as our compass, we can reach our new horizon.', 'And so today, I ask you to join with me, to keep our economy growing and to bring a new wave of fundamental change to this nation - starting with revolutionary improvements in our public schools.', 'I ask you to join with me, to build safe and livable communities, where we protect our environment, and restore the quality of life we deserve.', ""I ask for your help to strengthen family life in America. And I make you this pledge: if you entrust me with the Presidency, I will marshal its authority, its resources, and its moral leadership to fight for America's families."", 'With your help, I will take my own values of faith and family to the Presidency - to build an America that is not only better off, but better. And that is why today, I announce that I am a candidate for President of the United States.', 'Seven years ago, we needed to put America back to work -- and we did. Now we must build on that foundation. We must make family life work in America.', 'For the issue is not only our standard of living, but our standards in life. The measure is not merely the value of our possessions, but the values we possess.', 'We have closed our budget deficit. But today, we find a deficit of even greater danger, one that only seems to deepen the harder we work, and the better we do.', 'These are our deficits now: the time deficit in family life; the decency deficit in our common culture; the care deficit for our little ones and our elderly parents. Our families are loving but over-stretched.', ""These deficits cannot be measured in monthly economic tables, or even in the size of a family's paycheck."", 'To find them, you have to look harder - at the places our statistics do not describe:', 'The dinner tables that sit empty, when working parents do not have the time to share a meal with their children.', 'The entertainment that glorifies aggression and indecency, with lessons more vivid and overpowering than those in the classroom.', 'The schools where discipline is eroding - and the school hallways where guns and fear are becoming too common.', ""The communities where too many families hardly know their neighbors' names anymore - and find it too hard to honor an aging parent by keeping them and caring for them in the neighborhoods they love."", 'The crisis in the American family today knows no boundary of class or race. It is a challenge we share together, and it is one we must overcome together.', ""One of the best ways to help American families is by making America's public schools the finest in the world."", ""With your help, I will bring revolutionary improvement to our public schools. And I'll start by making high quality pre-school available to every child, in every community, all across the entire United States."", 'With your help, I will reduce class sizes, and establish high standards and accountability. I will make it easier for parents to save for college tuition - tax-free, and inflation-free. I will improve teacher quality, and treat teachers like professionals.', 'We have to have schools that instill the values and character we need in the next generation. And every school in America has to be drug-free and gun-free.', 'While some want to pass new protections for gun manufacturers, to shield them from lawsuits, I will work to get guns off the streets, out of the schools, and away from children and criminals.', ""We must also expand community policing, with more cops walking the beat. It's not enough to support the death penalty - which I do. We must also give police new crime-fighting tools to track every lead, catch every criminal, and protect every citizen."", 'And families deserve refuge from a culture of violence and mayhem. I will work to give parents the ability to protect their children from the marketing of cruelty and degradation.', 'Parents also deserve help balancing work and family. I want to bring after-school programs to every community in America. And no parent should have to risk losing a job to go to a parent-teacher conference at school, or to drive a child or an aging parent to the doctor. And I will expand the Family and Medical Leave Act, to make sure that we do just that.', ""Families deserve decent, affordable health care -- with good long-term care for their loved ones. Kids need their grandparents; grandparents need their grandkids. How many old people in America live in loneliness? I will make it easier for our elderly to get health care in their homes. And I will make sure that we pass the Patients' Bill of Rights."", 'And, I will never privatize Social Security or destroy it by diverting funds intended for Social Security. I will strengthen Social Security, not undermine Social Security.', ""While some want to raise the cost of Medicare and force seniors into HMO's, I will make sure that Medicare is never weakened, never looted, never taken away. I believe it is time also to help seniors pay for the prescription drugs they need. It's time we acted."", 'And Tipper and I want to see the day when mental illness is treated like any other illness, by every health plan in America.', 'And I see on the horizon an America where people with disabilities are fully respected for the abilities they have, everywhere in this land.', ""Responsible men and women must make their own most personal decisions based on their own consciences, not government interference. Some try to duck the issue of choice. Not me. American women must be able to make that decision for themselves. I will stand up for a woman's right to choose."", ""All these policy choices are important. But let's remember this: no executive action can mend a broken family. No legislation can reconnect a parent to a child, or a family to a grandparent. No proposal can change a culture that does not place family life at the top of our hierarchy of values, where it belongs."", 'So today, I say to every parent in America: it is our own lives we must master if we are to have the moral authority to guide our children. The ultimate outcome does not rest in the hands of any President, but with all our people - taking responsibility for themselves, and for each other. So my first promise is to ask you, each of you, to fulfill that American promise.', 'I want all of our communities to be working communities. We have moved more than six million people off our welfare rolls. Now we must make sure the jobs and opportunities are there, to restore self-sufficiency and self-esteem. And we must not only sustain the Earned Income Tax Credit, we must raise the minimum wage.', ""Families deserve work that pays. And I will fight for this simple principle: an equal day's pay for an equal day's work."", 'Families deserve real neighborhoods - where the word ""neighbor"" is not just a geographic term but a moral one. Let us become neighbors again.', 'We can create a true ""politics of community"" by working more closely with faith-based organizations to heal the afflicted, feed the hungry, and house the homeless in their own communities.', 'We can sustain such good, strong, livable communities - with green spaces where our children can thrive away from gangs and drugs. With smart growth, we can take back our neighborhoods from sprawl, and make the places our kids call home more than desolate stretches of structures and roads.', ""Some want to cut back on environmental protection and let polluters off the hook. I will never allow that to happen. The environment is our children's home too. We are in a crucial time when it comes to the health of our Earth; it is our children's most precious inheritance, without which everything else we leave them is meaningless."", ""We teach our kids respect by our own actions -- and also by showing respect ourselves for the God's green Earth. I will address the international challenge of global warming - with new technologies that create more jobs, and make our economy even stronger."", 'American families deserve a strong economy. I know what works. I will balance the budget or better -- every year. I will search out every last dime of waste and bureaucratic excess. I know how to do that. I will ask Congress for the power to reach new trade agreements, and open new markets to our goods and services -- but I will also ask for, and use, the authority to negotiate labor and environmental protections in those agreements, whenever necessary. My Administration will lay the foundation for groundbreaking economic innovation -- so that America leads the global new economy of the 21st Century.', 'We have an opportunity to shape a world of freedom and open markets, of rising living standards and human dignity all around the world.', 'But this world is still a dangerous place. We face new threats that know no borders: terrorism and rogue states, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and ancient ethnic hatreds that resurface to tear nations apart.', 'Make no mistake, America must lead the world. And we must always be strong enough to do so. I am proud that we refused to yield to the forces of barbarism in Kosovo. America refused to back down or look away from the face of ethnic slaughter. For an alliance of young democracies to rise up against a Medieval tyranny is the right way to end this millennium - having learned something. And let me say: President Clinton was right to stand for freedom.', 'I served my nation proudly in Vietnam. I have always, always been for a strong defense - above politics, above party, above partisanship.', ""And, I will always stand with America's veterans. And I am honored by the veterans who are standing with us here today."", 'They know foreign policy is no game, nor is it the proper arena for partisan politics, or easy soundbites. The world today is complex and volatile in the extreme -- more than it has ever been. You deserve a leader who has been tested in it -- who knows how to protect America, and secure peace and freedom.', 'Of course, as we defend democracy around the world, we must give democracy new strength and meaning here at home. We all know, inside of us, the way things are supposed to be in America. The way it is supposed to be, no one is hungry; no one is illiterate; no one faces prejudice. The way it is supposed to be, faith -- in ourselves and our mission on this Earth -- lights our steps.', 'But when all is said and counted, when we in our generation are finished adding up our deeds, our possessions, all our material and scientific advances, I believe we will ultimately be judged by whether we have strengthened or weakened the families that are the hope and soul of America.', 'I am not satisfied. Indeed, I am restless. I believe we can do better. I believe we must build on our success, not rest on it. I believe we have what it takes, not only to keep our economy strong, but also to make our values the strongest compass for our future, and the strongest force on Earth.', ""As we begin this new millennium, we will face many new questions. But the most important is as old as America itself. It's the one we faced at Concord and Lexington. The question at the heart of the Miracle at Philadelphia in 1776, and at every critical juncture since -- from the cliffs at Normandy to the bridge at Selma:"", 'The question is: will we turn back now - or will we move forward?', 'That is the question I will put to you, the American people, in this campaign. History makes no promises to keep the good times going in the absence of our own wise choices. It is all too easy to slide backward if we are not vigilant, or if we allow ourselves to be seduced with eloquent words advancing harmful realities. No matter what language you speak:', 'Sin accion, las palabras no valen nada - aunque sean bonitas. Mis amigos, seguiremos, trabajando juntos, mano a mano, para el futuro de nuestras familias y nuestros ninos.', ""If you believe America must move forward - if you are ready for America to choose the good once more -- then let us lead this nation together. Come with me toward America's new horizon. Across that horizon stands the promise of our common values and prosperity - of strengthening every family, lifting every child, leveling every barrier, leaving no one behind."", 'Here, at the center of my home town, in the heart of America, in the midst of the people I love - that is the new horizon I see.', 'I need you for this journey. So together let us vow, in these first long days of summer, that we will work through the night, so that our children may make a clean start from the right place -- a higher place -- in a fresh century.', 'Thank you and may God bless you.', 'And God Bless America.']"
1,"Albert Gore, Jr. ","January 07, 2000","['It is humbling to return to the Ebenezer Baptist Church - to join the King family once again on this high ground of our history and our hopes.', 'In the years of my life, I have stood in many places.', 'I stood on the steps of the United States Capitol, to be sworn in as Vice President of the United States.', 'I stood in communities devastated by poverty and crime. Then I stood on the rostrum of the United States Senate and cast tie-breaking votes to pass an economic program and renew our prosperity - to close the gun show loophole; and try to reduce a little more the chances of a madman with a gun shooting on our streets, or our playgrounds, or ever again in this church.', ""Last week, I presided over the United Nations Security Council, and brought America's pledge of aid to fight the sweeping pain of H.I.V.-AIDS in Africa."", 'I was moved and humbled to be in each of those places. But in a moral sense, no honor is so great as to stand and speak from here, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke to the heart and conscience of America.', 'It was 40 years ago this month that Dr. King ascended to this pulpit. From here, he sent his words and ideals into peaceful battle -- and turned the tide of history.', 'From here, again and again, he summoned us to 1hate evil, and love good, and establish justice in the gate.', 'This pulpit, this simple wooden structure with these few steps, is sacred ground in this land of liberty.', 'And we must preserve this place, as well as the spirit of this place, for future generations.', ""So first of all today, I can announce that in addition to the half million dollars we committed last year through our Save America's Treasures initiative, another half million in private funds has now been donated to restore this house of worship, and conserve it as the national treasure it is, for as long as this nation exists."", 'I want to pay tribute to two generous women who were active in the struggle, but wish to remain anonymous, because they have made this gift on behalf of all who sat in, who marched, who raised their voices, who gave their hands and their hearts. And they hope to inspire a new generation of Americans to carry on the cause.', ""I am also proud to announce, today, on Dr. King's birthday, that we will ask Congress for one and a half million dollars to preserve and maintain his birthplace - which is literally the cradle of the civil rights movement."", 'We must honor and uphold the dreamer. For we have come many miles toward justice, but have not yet fulfilled the dream.', 'In the two years since I last stood in this pulpit, we have made further strides together that should be measured today.', 'In those two years, African-American unemployment has fallen to the lowest level in history.', 'African-American poverty has fallen to the lowest level in history.', 'And African-American child poverty has fallen to the lowest level in history.', 'In those two years, African-American home-ownership has risen to an all-time high.', 'And in those two years, we have continued to surpass every past mark for appointment of African Americans to Cabinet seats, judgeships, and other high-ranking posts.', 'If Dr. King were with us now, I believe he would celebrate our gains, because they nourish our dreams, and then he would summon us on. And he, above all others, would turn us to the hard work that is still undone, and he would point out the rare moment, pregnant with possibility, now before us.', ""We have a chance and a challenge that comes to only a few generations -- to open a new era of progress, so that we can keep Dr. King's promise that our bright yesterdays will be transformed into brighter tomorrows."", 'We can, and we must, as he said, I move on in these powerful days to make America what it ought to be.', 'To build on our beginnings - and lift up the one in five children still living below the poverty level.', 'To teach our children well - so that never again will there be urban communities where 40 percent of the students who enter high school never graduate. Let us open doors of opportunity for them - so they too can dream and reach for their dreams.', 'Let us insist that liberty is indivisible -- so that no Asian-American or Latino or African-American will be stopped while driving a car just because of his or her physical appearance.', 'Racial profiling is a scar on the face of America.', 'Let us defeat the forces, of hate -- so that never again win any American be dragged to his death behind a pick-up truck by the demonic force of racial hatred.', ""In my faith tradition, the true prophet of God's message for humankind is the one who comes forth to say: I have been called, as we have all been called, to bring good news to the poor. To bring healing to the sick. To mend the broken-hearted. To speak out clearly on behalf of the oppressed."", 'Dr. King reminded us that prophetic truth is marching on.', 'He taught us that there is no such thing as partial freedom. An of our people must be free from economic privation, or none of our people will be fully free. In his last speech, delivered from the pulpit of Mason Temple in Memphis, Tennessee - when he told of his vision from the mountaintop - he reminded us of the urgent need to build la greater economic base.', 'So we must keep our prosperity going - not for the primary benefit of those who already have the most - but to profit at last those who as yet have so little. Like Dr. King, we do not seek to comfort the comfortable: we do not seek to give away our hard-won surplus to the powerful few, but to use it to establish justice and opportunity for the many.', 'Once, there was a dream, shining and distant. Now the day that once seemed far away has risen within our vision, and lies within our reach.', 'In the dawning light of this new day, I see good jobs and thriving businesses in every neighborhood. I hear every child waking up to the embrace of a whole and healthy family, secure in a safe and vibrant community.', 'I see a hopeful day, when the single mothers who have sacrificed so much have full access to the quality care for their children that affords them the opportunity to both earn a living and shower their children with love and attention.', 'I see a day of revolutionary improvement in our public schools - brought about with millions finding the truest path out of poverty through the classroom door.', 'I see a day when we Americans affirm our teachers, instead of blaming them. A day when we call our best young people to the vocation of teaching, treat them like the professionals they are, and reward them appropriately.', 'Would all the teachers who are here please stand? We honor you today, as we should every day. You are heroes.', ""And I say to all of you, if we care about an equal America, now is not the time to divert public money from public schools, where ninety percent of America's children are educated. Now is not the time to bemoan the failures and give up on reform. Now is the time for revolutionary improvements in our public schools - and a shared commitment to make them' the best in the world."", 'I see a day -- and I tell you that day is coming - when we will achieve, in ways both practical and bold, health coverage for every child in America, and then health coverage for every American.', 'Dr. King believed that no one should have to want for medical care when they are old or sick.', 'No one should have their health determined by their wealth.', ""And I see a day when we strengthen Medicare and Medicaid - which were created in Dr. King's lifetime, and must not be torn down in ours."", ""I see a day when we banish violence from our streets - when we take guns away from children and criminals, and make our schools and neighborhoods sanctuaries of safety and peace. A child can't reach for his -dreams if he's ducking for cover."", ""I believe we as a people can reach the days of our dream. I believe, in my heart, that today's prosperity offers not only a chance, but a moral command - to create an America that lives up to the lessons and legacy of Dr. King's life."", ""And I believe that for all the progress we have made in our nation's policies, we must renew our commitment to build Dr. King's beloved community and overcome the forces of complacency, indifference, fear of difference, and the racial hatred that embitters too many human hearts."", 'These forces are all too real. Their power grows when we ignore them.', ""I hear some in America arguing that our nation's historic struggle for justice and equality is over - that we have already reached the promised land -- that we now have a color-blind society."", ""They're confusing the wilderness with Canaan."", 'Like thirsty men too long in the desert, they see fountains in the sand. They gaze at the shimmering mirage of a city on a hill. But their eyes are playing tricks on them. Our journey is not over. The city we seek stiff lies ahead - beyond the horizon of justice.', 'This is what Dr. King would have called moral blindness. It is a condition that affects the heart as well as the eyes. Those who suffer from it have the capacity to look and not see.', ""They look at African American poverty, and diminished opportunity, and increased infant mortality, and unequal law enforcement, and they don't really see a cause for affirmative action. They don't feel any need to confirm Bill Lann Lee. They don't see the need to aggressively remove the barriers of discrimination that are still all around us."", 'Yes, they have eyes, but they do not see. They do not see that we must five together and advance together.', 'Let us transcend what separates us, and cherish what we have in common. For he 1who serves my father as a child is surely kin to me.', 'Today, 32 years after we lost him, America still needs the soaring dream of Martin Luther King.', 'Martin, where are you? We need your prophetic voice - and we hear it now, even from the grave, the words and the ideals that will never die.', 'We need those thundering words; we need those righteous ideals. As we have been reminded:', 'We shall overcome must be more than a memory from the past. It must be a resolve to find the true America at last.', 'We shall overcome has got to be more than a frame of mind; it must be a commitment to leave no child behind.', 'We shall overcome has got to be more than a freedom song; it must be a God-given faith that right will conquer wrong.', ""We shall overcome has got to be more than a fine we sing; it must be a fight to make things right - so all God's 'Children can hear the freedom bell ring."", 'And then the crooked places shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed.', ""And as Dr. King revealed in his life: here in this world, God's will must be our work. So with God's grace, and in the unquenchable light of Martin Luther King Jr.'s memory, let us go forward to finish the job. Thank you.""]"
2,"Albert Gore, Jr. ","March 27, 2000","[""I'm honored to be here at Marquette University. And I'm honored to be joined by someone who lives up to the high progressive ideals of Wisconsin — and who leads this nation in the fundamental cause of campaign reform -- Senator Russ Feingold."", 'I want to begin by sharing the words of another great advocate of political reform, a man who said, four decades ago:', '""I am one who believes in the principle of one man, one vote?I believe in the ?equality of man, the equality of opportunity, rights, and privileges? and one of these rights is the right to have an equal influence on the selection of public officials.""', 'That man was my father, Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee, speaking on the floor of the United States Senate in a day and decade when few even worried about the influence of money in politics — and even fewer dared to stand up for change. He made a career of standing up to powerful interests — from waging the earliest battles for Medicare, to casting some of the rare Southern votes in the Senate for gun control.', 'During and after the 1956 Presidential election, my father led the most sweeping investigation of campaign contributions and spending that had been conducted up to that time. Here is what he found:', '--Limitless, unregulated contributions were making a mockery of our campaign finance laws.', '--Special-interest donations were being used to manipulate elections and thwart the public will.', '--And in my father\'s own words, ""the lack of proper controls over the raising and spending of money in political campaigns poses the greatest danger to the democratic elective process.""', 'He was right then — and for all the laws passed since then, his words, sadly, continue to ring true today.', ""In 1970, my father lost his Senate seat -- in part because of the special-interest money that was funneled into his opponent's campaign by the Nixon dirty tricks operation."", 'I learned a powerful lesson about American politics from my father — a lesson I tried to sum up in one of my first contributions to the public debate as a freshman Congressman in 1978, when I argued that campaign finance reform ""is one of the most important steps we can take to return government to the people."" In that first term in Congress, I began an effort to persuade my colleagues and my constituents that as long as ""special-interest money control s campaign funding, the public interest will suffer .""', ""That's why I called for public financing of Congressional elections that same year, and throughout my service in Congress. It's why I pushed for measures to reduce campaign costs, limit PAC contributions, and fully disclose special-interest spending. It's why I sponsored or co-sponsored more than a dozen campaign finance reform bills since that first term in Congress."", 'I may not have been as effective in advancing this cause as your Russ Feingold has been. But I believe in it very deeply. My own commitment to this issue has made me appreciate even more the skill with which Russ Feingold and others have made this a part of our national debate.', 'And it has made me appreciate the real heroes in this fight — hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans, all across this country, who are determined to reclaim their democracy from the special interests. This movement has been carried forward by working men and women, housewives, ministers and factory hands -- ordinary people who insisted on making real the promise of our democracy — and insisted on making those at the highest levels of power respect the premise that in a democracy, all people are politically and morally equal.', 'No one better embodies the heart of this grassroots movement than Doris Haddock, better known as ""Granny D,"" a 90-year-old grandmother from New Hampshire who spent 14 months walking from California to Washington, D.C. to bring attention to this cause. And by the way, she was joined for part of that walk by my opponent, Bill Bradley — who along with John McCain, helped to put this issue at the forefront of this campaign.', 'It is on behalf of these ordinary heroes that I am here today — to talk about the steps we can take, both practical and bold, to restore faith in our democratic process again — to make American elections not endless competitions for cash, but true contests of ideas.', 'I understand the doubts about whether I personally am serious on campaign reform.', 'And I understand all too well the irony of our current fundraising system. Men and women of good intentions and high ideals want to protect the public interest, but have to raise private money in order to do so.', 'No decent public servant enters this line of work in order to raise money, but rather to serve the public. And most of those who donate the money would rather not be asked. We all know that the entire system needs reform. But we also know that there are millions of people who depend upon those who care about the public interest to fight for them, and who would be the ones hurt most if advocates for the public interest unilaterally disarmed, and left the field of battle to those who oppose both the public interest and campaign finance reform.', 'That was the choice I felt I faced in 1996 — and it was a battle to defend Medicare from deep cuts; to preserve our national commitment to education; to prevent our environmental laws from being re-written by the big polluters.', ""But that year, in fighting for what we believe in, Democrats, along with Republicans, engaged in fundraising that pushed the system to the breaking point and fueled further cynicism, which over time undermines the very things we're fighting for."", ""I've got the scars to prove it. And I know I may be an imperfect messenger for this cause. But the real wounds will be to our democracy itself unless we address this problem."", 'I also know that if we are led for the next four years by someone who actively opposes McCain-Feingold, has pledged to veto McCain-Feingold, and professes to see nothing wrong with the ills we seek to remedy, we certainly will make no progress. And indeed, the threat we now confront will become much worse.', 'So the first choice facing us, as always, is whether to try or not. And in simple terms, here is the contrast. I will try. And Governor Bush will not. He is committed to defending the status quo.', ""You know, Governor Bush talks a lot about being an outsider. But being an outsider is about more than where you live; it's about who you're fighting for. Believe it or not, Governor Bush wants to open the floodgates even wider to special interest donors and big money. That's not just defending the status quo — it's setting it in stone. And it will weigh down for decades the hopes and aspirations of our people."", ""I am committed to changing today's system of special-interest campaign financing. And although you have to take my word for this next point, I promise you that, if you entrust me with the Presidency, I will do more than try. I will lead. I will fight. And together with the thousands of Americans who are working to redeem the soul of our democracy, we will win this battle for campaign finance reform."", ""I know first-hand what is wrong with the way we fund political campaigns. I care very deeply about the integrity of our politics — and of course about my own integrity as well. My commitment to changing America's campaign finance laws is both personal and profound."", 'We cannot make the progress our nation needs until we end the dominance of money in our democracy. Let me cite a few examples:', ""Last year alone, the health and insurance industries lavished nearly seven million dollars in political contributions on both parties. Is it entirely an accident that we do not have a Patients' Bill of Rights, to ensure that medical decisions will be made not by the companies that made those donations, but by the doctors and nurses who deliver the care?"", 'Last year alone, the big drug companies bestowed more than four million dollars on both parties. Is it entirely an accident that so many in Congress defend drug industry price-gouging, instead of passing a prescription drug benefit for seniors on Medicare?', 'Last year alone, the big tobacco companies offered up more than two-and-a-half million dollars in contributions — most of them to one party. Is it entirely an accident that Congress refuses to enact tough legislation to protect our children from the addiction of cigarettes?', 'And make no mistake, this cancer on our democracy is growing. The tide of special-interest money rises relentlessly with each successive election cycle. The estimate is that — unless we agree to ban soft money in this campaign — half a billion dollars of it will be raised and spent in this election, overwhelming our campaign laws in a cascade of unregulated cash.', 'Three years ago, I called for both parties to ban soft money entirely -- and I have urged Governor Bush to join with me and ban soft money now. I have also asked Governor Bush to join with me in eliminating the single largest expenditure in any modern campaign — the 30-and 60-second ads that consume more than half of every dollar that is raised and spent — and instead debate twice a week, every week until election day, with a specific issue each time.', 'So far, Governor Bush has refused to join with me to change the way we conduct our campaigns. Instead, he has treated the issue of campaign reform as a political shell game -- launching personal attacks to hide the fact that he opposes McCain-Feingold and every real reform.', 'His notion of campaign reform is so-called ""Paycheck Protection"" — which in fact protects powerful interests by preventing labor unions and working families from having their voices heard, while leaving private concentrations of power free to contribute endless sums of soft money -- without any call for ""shareholder protection"" -- to finance limitless so-called issue ads. The Wyly brothers support his plan.', 'Frankly, under my plan, union spending would be a moot issue, because my plan would ban soft money contributions from both labor and corporations. And by the way, in 1998 business interests contributed $ 167 million in soft money — sixteen times as much as labor unions.', ""Yet Governor Bush's notion of campaign finance reform is to raise the contribution limits — so special interests can give even more, and get even more in return."", ""Let me tell you: if those are the results, then I think it's fair to say that George W. Bush is no reformer. Results for sure — but no reform."", 'I make you this pledge today: If you elect me as your President, the McCain-Feingold bill will be the first domestic legislation I send to the Congress — on my first day in office.', 'I will fight as long as I have to, and as hard as I have to, to pass the bill that bears the names of Russ Feingold and John McCain. And then, with your help, I will be the President who signs McCain-Feingold into law.', 'It will ban soft money for good. It will require full disclosure of the independent expenditures and special-interest committees that funnel billions into campaign advertising. It will increase the resources and strengthen the investigative powers of the Federal Election Commission — which desperately needs powers equal to the great responsibility of protecting the integrity of our democracy.', ""It won't be easy to break the grip of the special interests and pass McCain-Feingold next year. But here is what I will do:"", 'I will use the full reach of the bully pulpit to press the case for McCain-Feingold.', 'I will identify by name the special interests blocking the way, the money they are giving, and the officials who are doing their bidding.', 'I will listen to grassroots activists, support their mobilization, and build with them a powerful national coalition for reform.', ""And I will make it clear to every special-interest apologist that I will not give up, I will not back down, I will not walk away until McCain-Feingold, the people's will, is the law of the land."", 'Experience has shown us that the best path to political reform is step-by-step — and passing McCain-Feingold is the critical first step.', 'But we must go further in the term of the next President.', 'The next important steps are tough new lobbying reform, publicly-guaranteed TV time for debates and advocacy by candidates, and a crackdown on issue advocacy ads.', ""I will propose and fight for a law requiring monthly disclosure of all lobbyists' activities, posted on the Internet and fully accessible to the public. Every citizen will be able to find out to whom lobbyists have contributed, and the specific meetings they've gained to influence specific pieces of legislation."", 'Full disclosure of lobbying activities can help dry up the supply of special-interest money. Free TV time can help reduce the demand for it.', 'I said more than ten years ago — and I still believe today — that ""broadcasters are given a government license for exclusive use of the public airwaves. In return, they are expected to operate in the public interest.""', 'I will strongly advocate the approach developed by Paul Taylor. Every broadcaster should give every candidate for federal office five minutes of air time a night in the last thirty days before the general election. Cable operators should work with their content providers to establish a similar practice.', ""And if broadcast stations air independent issue ads, I believe they should be required by the FCC to give — for free -- the same amount of air time to both candidates in the race. If broadcasters wanted to avoid the requirement to give such free time, all they have to do is say no to the special interests who want to influence our campaigns. I will petition the FCC to issue a ruling that recognizes this requirement as a necessary part of broadcasters' obligation to serve the public. And I will appoint commissioners who — like some already on the FCC — believe the public interest must be protected in new ways, in light of new threats facing it."", 'Step by step, we can reduce the influence of special-interest money in campaigns. But our ultimate goal must be to eliminate it altogether.', ""Some believe the answer is a system of public financing for Congressional and Presidential elections, like the one I first supported in the 1970's."", 'However, bills to establish public financing of Congressional elections have been introduced in every single session of Congress for a quarter-century -- and not a single comprehensive public financing proposal has passed Congress. Almost none have been approved by even one Congressional Committee.', 'It is time for a new approach to achieve the fundamental goal of freeing our democracy from the coils of special-interest cash.', 'So I propose the creation of a non-partisan Democracy Endowment — to follow up on the urgent reform of our campaign finance laws by McCain-Feingold with a revolutionary change to further safeguard our self-government in the 21st Century.', 'The Democracy Endowment will raise more than $ 7 billion over seven years, and then, with the interest and the returns on investment, finance Senate and House general election campaigns — with no other contributions allowed to candidates who accept the funding.', ""Let me be clear: this is a non-partisan endowment for our common democracy. You can't give to any one party; you can't give to any one candidate. Every qualified candidate will have access to these funds according to a formula that is based on the district or state in which they are running. The views of the donor will have absolutely no influence on their views of the recipient. In this way, we will break the connection between the giving of money and the gaining of influence in these election contests."", 'To raise the funds for the Endowment, there will be a 100 percent tax deduction for any individual or corporation that contributes — on a first-come, first-serve basis — until the Endowment is filled. And as soon as it is filled, the tax deduction will sunset.', 'As President, I will work aggressively to secure these funds -- and I will seek the help of every corporation, every union, every major foundation, every dot-com millionaire and every other citizen in America.', 'If the endowment is not filled within seven years, the difference will be made up by free TV time — required of broadcasters as a condition for their licenses.', 'This will provide a powerful incentive for broadcasters to air public service announcements that will help fill the fund.', 'From McCain-Feingold to lobbying reform and a crack-down on special interest issue ads, to the Democracy Endowment, our cause is nothing less than the most sweeping campaign finance reform in history. And it will not be easy. For just as the tobacco companies battle every major measure to reduce teen smoking — just as the HMO lobbyists fight against measures to ensure the best health care, not just the cheapest — they and all the other special interests will be joined together in waging a mighty war to preserve their place and their privileges under the current political system.', 'But let us understand what is at stake here -- our faith in our own self-government, and ultimately, the very future of our democracy.', 'If we believe in the ideal of one person, one vote, as my father so strongly did — then let us fight for the reforms that make sure every vote counts equally.', 'If we believe in a government of the people, by the people, and for the people — then let us have an election process of the people, by the people, and for the people.', ""Some candidates portray themselves as being above the will of the people. They forget that, in spite of the system's degradation, their power still derives from the will of the people. I need you to keep raising your voices in a grassroots movement for reform. I need you to give me your mandate to carry this banner forward."", 'Together, we can end the money chase, and create a system where we pursue our highest ideals. And if you entrust me with the Presidency, I make you this pledge: I will fight for political reform. I will fight for you. I will fight to give the power in our politics back to the people. Thank you.']"
3,"Albert Gore, Jr. ","May 05, 2000","['Throughout this campaign - starting with my first major policy address, one year ago in Iowa -- I ve talked about the steps we must take to bring truly revolutionary improvements to our schools, with new resources, new accountability, and public school choice.', 'I ve talked about the need to make education a national priority, with greater national investment -- from universal pre-school, to smaller class sizes, to tax cuts that help families save for college, to tax-free 401(j) accounts for lifelong learning. I ve talked about the importance of demanding more - from students, teachers, parents, and schools. Last week in Dallas, I described my plan for accountability across our entire school system.', 'I believe very strongly that investment without accountability is a waste of money. And accountability without investment is doomed to failure.', ""But you and I both know that neither will matter if we don't elevate the teaching profession, and help teachers meet high standards."", 'And so today, I want to talk about what our country must do for our teachers -- and what our teachers must do in return.', 'Let me begin with a simple pledge. If I m entrusted with the Presidency, I will ensure that there is a fully-qualified, well-trained teacher in every single classroom, everywhere in this nation, by the end of the next four years.', 'To meet that basic goal, I believe we have to commit ourselves to three fundamental objectives.', 'First, we have to attract the most talented Americans to the teaching profession. Second, as you help to ensure higher standards and greater accountability, we have to raise teacher salaries and reward you for success. Third, we have to give teachers the training and support they need to meet high standards of excellence.', 'My opponent, George W. Bush, has talked about teacher quality. But he has no serious plan to hire the new teachers we need to meet surging enrollments and to reduce class size. He has no plan to raise teacher salaries. He has no serious plan to ensure that all new teachers are well-trained teachers. And instead of giving teachers and students the resources they need to teach and learn, he supports private school vouchers - which would drain precious public dollars away from our teachers and schools.', 'I believe Governor Bush has the wrong approach. Teachers are some of the hardest-working people in America. We can t improve our schools by shortchanging our teachers.', 'I have a different view. We should treat teachers like the professionals you are - we should expect high professional standards -- and we should pay you like professionals.', 'You might say that I was raised on a respect for the teaching profession. My father grew up in a community named Possum Hollow, in Middle Tennessee. When he was just eighteen, he went to work as a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse. He taught in a small mountain community that was nicknamed ""Booze"" - for reasons we don\'t have to discuss this afternoon.', ""When my dad started out as a teacher, he had just three months of college -- but that was enough for his students to call him Professor Gore. I dare say that the teachers here today have done a bit more to earn the respect your students give you. Eventually, my father graduated from Murfreesboro State Teachers College, and became Superintendent of Schools for Smith County - a job he held until he became Tennessee's Commissioner of Labor."", 'I learned a lot about the power of good teaching from my mother, too. She started her education in a one-room schoolhouse - a lot like the one my father later taught in. She later worked her way through college, and took her blind sister, my aunt Thelma, with her - taking notes and reading lessons for both of them. She then asked the Rotary Club for a $ 100 loan and took the bus to Nashville, where she got a room at the YWCA, waited tables at an all-night coffee shop for 25-cent tips, and became one of the first women in history to graduate from Vanderbilt Law School.', 'She often told me that without the kindness and help she received from her teachers and professors, she never could have made it all the way to her law school degree. Today, at 87 years old, she still remembers every single teacher who had an impact on her. I ll bet a lot of your students will feel the same way in 70 or 80 years.', ""We all know that good teaching is the very foundation of our children's future. That is why it is essential that we increase the number of teachers in our schools; recruit highly-qualified teachers all across this country; and reward teachers for the crucial work you do."", 'You know as well as I do: this challenge has never been greater than it is today.', ""Student enrollments are rising each year. The generation of students eighteen and under is now the largest generation in history. They just broke the all-time record set by the Baby Boomers - and they ll break the record again next fall, and every year for ten years to come. In addition, our nation's teaching force is aging - which means that more teachers are retiring each year. And at the same time, the wage gap between teachers and other professionals is widening."", ""Today, we're hiring 100,000 new teachers to help local communities reduce class size - and we're insisting that every new teacher hired under that program be fully qualified."", 'But there are still far too many teachers in our classrooms who have only emergency certification.', 'And the truth is, our states and school districts will need to hire 2.2 million new teachers in the next decade - at a time when it is becoming harder and harder to do so. And to meet our responsibility to the next generation, we need to fill those vacancies while raising standards, not lowering them, and while reducing class sizes, not raising them.', ""Let's also recognize that far too many of teachers today are overworked and underpaid."", 'As some of you may know, almost every week I hold what I call ""School Days"" - days when I participate in every aspect of the life of a school. That\'s why I spent today at Holt High School in Lansing. And before these School Days, I always spend the night at the home of a teacher - and go with that teacher to school the next morning. Last night, I stayed at the home of Margo Strong, a computer teacher at Holt High School, her husband Jay, a first-grade teacher at Holt Elementary School, and their two children, Anna and Nick.', ""Last month, when I visited L Anse Creuse Middle School in Macomb County, I spent the night at the home of Claudia Amboyer. She's a sixth-grade teacher with twelve years of experience and a master's degree in education. She is recognized as one of the best teachers you can find, and she is at the top of the teaching salary scale in her school district."", ""Claudia's 19-year-old son just got a job as a web page architect -- and he's making almost the same salary that his mother makes, after she has spent a dozen years in one of the most important jobs in our country. What's wrong with this picture? In too many schools, low salaries are just one part of the burden. We're asking teachers to educate our children in overcrowded classrooms - with textbooks that are out of date, classrooms that are not connected to the Internet, and facilities that are falling down."", ""I ve been to schools that are so old that the windows don't close properly - and in the wintertime, snow piles up on the floor."", 'I was in a classroom in Ohio a few weeks ago where a large window had been broken in September -- and it still hadn t been replaced.', 'I ve been to schools where the facilities are so overcrowded that the children have to eat lunch in shifts -- with the first shift starting at 9:30 in the morning.', 'I ve been to schools all over this country that no longer have playgrounds or an athletic field because they re covered up with trailers serving as temporary classrooms.', ""I ve been to schools where the classrooms are so full, and the teachers are so overburdened, students are reluctant to take the teacher's time - even when they don't understand the material - because they feel guilty adding to the obviously crushing burden on their teacher. Those students quietly resign themselves to settle for less - because that's what they see our country doing in not investing adequately in our schools."", 'Teachers have to shoulder all these burdens - at a time when you re under greater pressure than ever to give our children a world-class education.', 'No wonder almost a quarter of all new teachers leave the profession within three years.', 'So how can we boost teacher quality nationwide, and give all our teachers the support they need to succeed? How can we do more to honor and appreciate our teachers - as we summon a whole new generation to careers in teaching?', ""We have to start by launching an aggressive national campaign - in high-need subjects and in high-need areas - to help school districts put one million new well-trained teachers in America's classrooms. That will make it a lot easier for states and local communities to finish the job of hiring all the teachers we will need."", 'I propose the creation of a new 21st Century Teachers Corps -- open to talented people across the country. If college students agree to spend four years teaching in a school that needs their help, we ll give them up to $ 10,000 each to pay for tuition. For those already in college who agree to become teachers in the schools that need them most, we should help them pay back their student loans.', 'For those willing to switch careers and go into teaching, we ll provide a $ 10,000 hiring bonus and pay for training to prepare them for the classroom. And we ll make sure they have high-quality, alternative ways to become certified, without requiring them to take for a second time the courses they have already successfully completed in order to qualify for their present career.', ""Teaching is one of America's most important professions. All of us share a stake in its success. It's not enough to honor and respect today's teachers - we have to work together, to attract and lift up the teachers of tomorrow. I want to lead a nationwide effort - in partnership with the private and non-profit sectors -- to persuade talented Americans of all backgrounds to choose careers in the classroom."", ""That brings me to the second challenge we must meet. If we're serious about making teaching a true profession and attracting the most talented Americans to our classrooms - and if we're serious about asking teachers to help us raise standards and accountability -- we should pay our teachers like professionals, and reward good teaching."", 'I am convinced, after campaigning all across this country for the proposition that education must be our top priority for investing in the future, that the American people do not support spending more money for what they fear would be the same old results. But I have also learned that there is no question that if the American people believe that new resources are going to be accompanied by meaningful reforms and new accountability to reach higher standards, they are extremely supportive of devoting significantly more resources to our schools.', ""Think about it: we're asking America's teachers to meet our greatest obligation for the future. We're asking them to educate and help mold our children. Yet we pay them far less than other professionals with essentially the same qualifications are now earning. And that is wrong. In communities where schools, teachers, community groups, and local businesses agree on effective plans to raise teacher quality, let's give every qualified teacher a $ 5,000 raise."", ""Let's give $ 10,000 raises to master teachers, and those who become certified by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards."", ""Let's reward all teachers in schools where the entire school meets agreed-upon performance goals - which include higher student achievement. Let's work with teachers and administrators to develop plans that reward individual teachers. And based on the innovative plan negotiated and partly designed by teachers in Denver, I believe we should ask teachers to help us find proper ways to integrate gains in student performance with the other criteria that should be used for rewarding excellence in teaching."", 'The simple fact is that raising teacher salaries and rewarding excellence is essential to the third challenge I want to discuss -- making sure that all teachers have the professional development and support they need to meet higher standards.', 'If I m entrusted with the Presidency, I will require states to guarantee that all teachers are fully certified or working toward certification - and that all middle school and high school teachers have a major, a minor, or demonstrated ability in the subject they teach.', 'According to one recent survey, only 36 percent of teachers consider themselves to be ""very well prepared"" to meet the standards of their state or school district. Right now, one quarter of all high school teachers don\'t have even a minor in the subject they teach.', ""So I will combine greater accountability with greater investment - building on our recent $ 1 billion national commitment to intensive professional development for America's teachers."", 'For example, I think teachers should have paid time away from the classroom to visit the classrooms of master teachers, in order to pick up new skills and techniques.', 'I believe all new teachers should have to pass a rigorous and fair assessment -- which includes tests in the subjects they will teach -- before they set foot in the classroom. We should test new elementary school teachers, to make sure they are prepared to teach the crucial subject of reading, as part of a national crusade to ensure that every child can read independently and well by the end of the third grade. And I believe states should be required to conduct these tests as a condition for receiving federal funding.', 'Every new teacher should be required to meet rigorous standards before being licensed or tenured - and every new teacher should have the mentors and professional support to make the transition into teaching.', 'Tenure should be based on a careful evaluation of each teacher\'s performance - including, but certainly not limited to, the academic progress of that teacher\'s students. Other factors must also be taken into account, factors such as the degree of difficulty confronted by teachers in the communities where they teach, the degree of parental involvement, the degree to which ""team teaching"" makes it difficult to assess the individual contribution one teacher makes to student performance. And in all cases, the system for granting tenure should be designed with heavy teacher input. But let me be clear on the central point, and it is a point that I know many of you disagree with: tenure should be based, at least in part, on student performance.', 'The granting of a teaching license should be followed by rigorous but fair performance evaluations, and access to regular training and professional development. And every five years, performance evaluations -- tied to individual professional development plans -- should be used to determine whether a license is renewed. But teachers should have help in paying for the professional development needed.', 'I urge faster but fair ways, within due process, to identify, help -- and when necessary - speedily remove low-performing teachers. While we know the vast majority of teachers are doing a good job, we know there are a few who are not. And we know that they unfairly reflect on all those who are. That means that while we absolutely must respect due process, we have to put an end to endless delays in removing those teachers who really need to be removed.', ""We should also empower principals, with the active participation and advice of teams of teachers, to hire their own staffs -- based on expertise and support for the school's academic mission, and not solely on seniority. And we should empower principals, with the participation of teachers, to manage their own budgets."", 'At its best, teaching is a lifetime vocation. But no teaching license or contract should be a lifetime job guarantee. And let me be clear: we have to give all our teachers the support and training they need to succeed.', ""I know Michigan's teachers will not agree with me on all of these proposals. But I believe these proposals will move us closer to the goals we share: lifting up the teaching profession, building public support for public schools, and making our schools the best in the world."", 'Finally, we must realize that we cannot raise the quality of teaching without the support and conditions that enable good teaching. We have to give teachers the smaller classes, modern school buildings, good working conditions, and the real role in decision-making that they need to succeed in the classroom.', 'My education plan increases our national commitment to public education - and it rejects the false promise of private school vouchers. We will never improve education or increase accountability by taking taxpayer money away from public schools - and giving it to private schools that are not accountable.', 'These are the steps I believe we must take to increase the number of teachers in America, and to raise the quality of teaching. We cannot meet high standards until we are willing to set high standards - and then reward the teachers who meet those standards. Only by elevating the entire profession can we meet the needs of students and schools, and convince the American people to meet our obligation to bring revolutionary improvement to our public schools.', 'Governor Bush offers a far different approach when it comes to education.', 'He seems to think that if he gives a speech on education, the American people won t figure out what his program really is - some soothing words, a tiny bit of help, and a voucher program that would actually drain resources from public schools to private schools.', 'Governor Bush wants to privatize education - just like he wants to privatize Social Security.', ""Any teacher in America knows: you don't judge a term paper by its cover. But when you take a close look inside the Bush education plan - well, it's mostly blank pages."", 'I ve already talked about how Governor Bush shortchanges education investment - with no plan for national school construction, no plan for universal pre-school, and no plan for smaller class size. The contrast is even greater when it comes to teacher quality and accountability.', 'I make a commitment to raise teacher salaries and reward excellence in the classroom. Governor Bush does not.', 'I make a commitment to test all new teachers and remove low-performing teachers in ways that are both fast and fair. Governor Bush does not.', 'I have a plan to put one million new well-trained teachers in the classroom. Governor Bush does not. In fact, he would dismantle our plan to hire 100,000 well-trained teachers. And he only proposes a small increase in an existing teacher recruitment program - and most of that increase is in the budget our administration has already submitted to Congress.', 'I am proposing a major national investment to make sure teachers have all the resources they need. And I think that we ought to end the common expectation that your net salary can only be calculated after you take out all the money you have to spend out of your own pockets to purchase supplies that the school ought to be supplying to you. All Governor Bush does for teacher resources is give you a $ 400 tax deduction - on the assumption that you will have to forever keep spending your own money, out of your own pockets, on the classroom supplies his plan will never provide.', ""I guess that's Governor Bush's idea of education investment; our teachers have to do the investing."", 'To make matters even worse, his major proposal in this campaign is a giant, $ 2.1 trillion tax giveaway - which would be certain to force cuts in public education.', ""If he thinks that's the way to invest in education, then he may need help from some of the math teachers in this room."", ""None of this is surprising if you look at Governor Bush's record in Texas. Texas ranks 41st in the nation in standards for teacher quality. Texas teachers are paid less than the national average - which may be why more than a quarter of them work second jobs."", ""You don't need me to tell you: there is no greater test of our national responsibility than the quality of the education we provide. And there is no more important ingredient in American education than the people who are here today - the hard-working teachers who lift up our children, each and every day."", 'That is why I am proposing a major national commitment to education - to invest more in teachers and schools, and to demand more in return.', 'I want to build an America where you are respected and rewarded - and where we expect the very best from you.', 'I want to build an America where teaching takes its rightful place among the most honored of all professions.', ""Our future - our children's future - is in your hands, in your classrooms, and in your schools. Let's keep working together - because America's public schools have to be second to none. Let's make them the best. Thank you.""]"
4,"Albert Gore, Jr. ","May 15, 2000","[""I'm here this afternoon to talk about an issue that is critical to your future, and to the future of America: maintaining America's fundamental guarantee of Social Security."", ""Let me begin by saying that I know some younger Americans are skeptical about the future of Social Security. And the truth is, as the Baby Boomers retire and our senior population doubles, Social Security does need to be reformed. That's why one of my central proposals in this campaign is a plan to strengthen it."", 'Ten years ago, we faced some pretty difficult choices about how achieve that goal. America faced giant budget deficits as far as the eye could see. We were quadrupling our national debt, and entering a deep recession.', 'There seemed to be no way out other than rewriting the basic guarantees of Social Security. Many thought we would have to cut benefits, raise the retirement age, or raise Social Security taxes — or even begin to privatize the system.', ""Today, we face a far different situation, and a far better prospect. In the last seven years, we've balanced the federal budget. We're paying down the national debt."", 'Some of you may know that for 11 years now, there has been a national debt clock over Times Square in New York City — put up by private citizens to keep track of our mounting debt. Back then, the debt was growing so fast that the numbers on that clock were practically a blur. Once, it had to be turned off because the numbers were changing so fast, the computer running the clock crashed.', ""But now, we're making so much progress toward paying down our debt, it has just been announced that the debt clock will be unplugged and removed from Times Square this fall."", 'Our economy is strong today. And if we keep making responsible choices, we can reform Social Security in the right way. We can reform Social Security in a way that preserves the fundamental guarantee of retirement security — and also pays down our debt, keeps our economy strong, and enables us to meet our other great challenges.', ""Let's understand what Social Security means to the millions of Americans who depend on it. It's more than a way to build up some extra savings. It's not just a way to make money in the stock market."", 'Social Security is a solemn compact between the generations. It is a basic guarantee of retirement security, built on a guaranteed minimum benefit. No matter what is happening on Wall Street, no matter how the economy is doing, Social Security is supposed to be there to guarantee a decent retirement for every American.', ""We know that many people can build up extra retirement savings through private investment and IRA's. That's important, and I support it. Investing in the stock market is not only good for individual Americans — it's good for America."", 'But that kind of private investment is meant not to replace Social Security, but to build on the foundation of Social Security. If we turn Social Security into a system of winners and losers, we will be jeopardizing retirement security for too many Americans — and in the end, we will all have to pay to make up the difference.', ""I've laid out a detailed plan to reform and strengthen Social Security — a plan that is based on fiscal responsibility and debt reduction."", ""If I'm entrusted with the Presidency, I'll balance the federal budget every year, and pay down our national debt every year — putting America on the road to becoming debt-free by the year 2013. That's the only way we can get ready to meet our obligations through Social Security."", ""Then I'll make sure we use the budget surplus and the money we save from paying down the debt to save Social Security first."", ""I'll devote all the interest savings from debt reduction to the Social Security trust fund. That way, we can keep Social Security solvent until at least 2050."", 'There is a fundamental difference on this issue in this election — which offers the country the most critical choice on Social Security since it was first enacted in 1935. Because there is a right way to reform Social Security, and a wrong way.', ""George W. Bush outlined his approach in a speech this morning. We still don't know all the details of his plan, but we do know that he is proposing to partially privatize Social Security."", 'Today, when Wall Street is booming, I know that plan sounds appealing. It probably sounds like an easy way to make more money, and have more control over your retirement.', 'But in reality, the Bush Social Security privatization plan would weaken our national economy — and undermine the basic guarantee of a minimum decent retirement.', ""It would weaken our economy because it would make it impossible to pay down our national debt. It would cost about $ 1 trillion over ten years to meet today's obligations through Social Security while allowing people to set up these individual accounts. And at the same time, Governor Bush is proposing a huge tax cut of nearly $ 2 trillion."", ""The numbers just don't add up -- and under the Bush plan, a serious reduction of our national debt is simply impossible. They'd have to put that debt clock back up in Times Square. By leaving us with a multi-trillion-dollar debt for as far as the eye can see, the Bush plan could trigger higher interest rates and slower long-term growth. It undermines our chance to meet other challenges, such as keeping Medicare solvent, or providing an affordable prescription drug benefit for seniors."", 'The Bush Social Security privatization plan also threatens the Social Security guarantee for future generations of retirees. That guarantee is the whole purpose of Social Security. Yet under the Bush plan, you could lose some or all of the money you invest — and millions could be left without enough to make ends meet.', 'Today, in the Dallas Morning News, Governor Bush was asked whether his plan would guarantee that future beneficiaries would receive no less than they would have under today\'s system. His answer? ""Maybe, maybe not.""', 'In other words, Governor Bush admits that his plan takes the ""security"" out of Social Security. Well, I believe you deserve a guarantee, not a ""maybe.""', ""Even if your own investments do well, it's inevitable that others won't be so lucky. Your friends, your neighbors, your relatives could be left without the retirement income they need. And if Governor Bush says: don't worry, my plan guarantees a minimum benefit even if you risk and lose some of your Social Security in bad investments, that just means a huge Savings & Loan-style bail-out to make up the difference. And the American taxpayer would end up footing a huge new bill."", ""Governor Bush proposes to create a semi-privatized Social Security system that could lead to greater reward for some — but far greater costs and risks for everybody. I believe we have to maintain Social Security as a bedrock guarantee of retirement security. On top of that foundation, people can and should build more — savings, investments, IRA's. But you shouldn't have to roll the dice with your basic retirement security — and you shouldn't have to pay for others who do."", ""That's why I am again challenging Governor Bush to debate this issue as soon as possible. We're not talking about a minor difference here. We're talking about a fundamental difference on the most successful social program in the history of this country."", ""I will take this issue to the American people in the weeks and months ahead, and I'm eager to have a full and open discussion today.

5,"Albert Gore, Jr. ","June 13, 2000","['Two decades ago, in the days before his election, Ronald Reagan asked a justly-famous question that deserves to be asked again today:', 'Are you better off than you were four years ago?', 'Let me go even further: are you better off than you were eight years ago?', 'For most Americans, I believe the answer is obvious.', 'Together as a nation, we turned the biggest deficits in our history into the biggest surpluses in our history.', 'We set our hands to a time of recession and doubt, and built it into a time of pride and plenty: the longest period of economic growth in the entire American record.', ""For example, together, we turned this great state around: instead of losing 130,000 jobs a year, New York's families have gained almost 120,000 jobs each and every year. You will find the same success story in almost every part of our country."", 'Instead of asking, as Americans did eight years ago, ""how did we get into this mess?"" -- people are asking now: what is the real cause of this economic boom?', 'The winning formula began with this: the hard work of the American people. But the American people have always been hard-working. Certainly they were hard-working in 1991.', ""The difference? We gave them the tools to build this economy better, so now it's able to blaze on the fuel of their ideas and skill."", 'Some want to challenge the record of the Clinton administration. In my view, that record is clear and undeniable.', 'None of this boom happened by accident. It happened because, together with the American people, we put in place a brand new economic strategy, one that unlocked the full potential of our people: balancing the budget, paying down the debt, and investing in the best enterprise of all people. Americans themselves.', 'It was a winning formula with three elements: fiscal discipline gave us lower interest rates. Lower interest rates sparked more investment, more jobs, and more growth. And all that has in turn fueled even greater investment in our people and our future.', ""No serious person can question the achievements of the 1990's. Now we must ask:"", 'Will we be better off still -- in terms of our affluence and in terms of our spirit -- four years from this day?', 'I intend to win this election on behalf of the American people to see to it that the answer is yes.', 'I intend to build even higher on the foundation of the Clinton years. Because this is a turning point for America.', ""The 1990's were about more than getting rid of America's debt. They were also about getting rid of America's doubt."", 'Remember how helpless people felt eight years ago, faced with deficits that were growing so fast, we could barely count them? It seemed as if there were no good choices -- no way to free ourselves - no way to break the shackles of recession and debt.', ""But together, we have. We're America. We've proven that we're not afraid of big choices, big decisions, and big dreams."", 'To those who said our economic plan would fail, that it would destroy jobs and choke off recovery - I say: look around you. You underestimated what we, the American people, are capable of doing.', 'To those who say prosperity has achieved its full reach, I say: just watch us.', 'We will deepen prosperity, and extend it to the homes and hearts of every family - from struggling immigrants who seek a better life for their children; to farmers and factory workers who need more money to pay the bills and more time with their families; to the young Internet geniuses from every background, hungering to transform our world.', ""To those who say we can't make our public schools the best in the world, I say: just watch us. We'll give all our kids a chance to learn more and lift themselves higher."", ""To those who say we can't cure cancer, ease the pain of disease, and give new health and hope to America's children, I say: just watch us. We'll harness all the wonders of science and discovery. We'll build an America where health is never again decided by wealth."", 'And to those who say that as America becomes more diverse, discrimination will only get worse, I say: lift your eyes. See how wide the American horizon has become.', 'All of us as Americans have had different experiences in the past. But we all share a common future. Now is the time for decision about what that future will be.', 'And that is why I want to make this election about the big choices we have to make to secure prosperity and progress for a new American century.', 'Imagine an America that closes out not just its material debts, but its moral debts as well: where working parents have the help they need to care for their children, and the chance to stay home with their babies if they wish to.', 'Imagine how we will transform education when all schools become thriving schools; when we give our children the best, and demand the best in return.', 'Imagine how we will improve human health when all our children can breathe clean air, drink pure water, and grow up with a stable climate in a healthy world.', ""To achieve this future, we have to make the right choices - in ethics no less than in economics. Right now, our economy is doing better than anyone expected. Believe it or not, I am here to give you still more good news: we're all learning that the estimates of America's budget surpluses, already the highest ever, are expected to rise yet again -- dramatically -- in the coming weeks. When the time is right and those numbers are firm, I'll lay out a detailed budget plan. And for the next three weeks, I'll be talking about the specifics of my plans and proposals."", 'Today, as the size of that surplus begins to come into view, I want to give you an outline of exactly what my plan is, and talk about the principles - moral and material - that will be my guide.', ""First and foremost, discipline. We have to do the right thing - because we can never go back to the days when we spent money we just didn't have."", ""Having the discipline not to run deficits isn't just materially wise, it is also morally wise. Living debt-free is an expression of our guiding American ideals of independence, self-reliance, being as good as our word."", 'If you stand with me, we will have a balanced budget every single year, and targeted tax cuts that we can afford.', 'Every proposal I have made in this campaign - every proposal I will make -- fits within a balanced budget that lets us save Social Security and Medicare, and also pays down our national debt every single year.', ""If we do things right, then we can give middle class families the tax cuts they need to put their own values into action. I am calling for the right kind of tax relief - tax cuts that are specially targeted to help those who need them the most. Tax cuts to let families live their values -- to help you save for college, pay for health insurance, and build additional security for your retirement. And an elimination of the current marriage penalty for working couples, which penalizes commitment to spouse and family, by forcing these couples to pay more in taxes just because they're married."", ""Here is what I will not do: I won't be profligate with your money. I won't spend money that we don't yet have on a huge tax cut our economy can't afford, in ways that could end our prosperity and progress."", ""Remember the children's tale of the goose that laid golden eggs? The moral was one every child can understand: when something works well, don't destroy it."", 'That same moral applies to our economy. Bad choices in a single year or a single budget could put prosperity beyond our reach again for a decade or more.', ""Discipline has been essential to the prosperity we have today. The wealth of the American spirit, embodied in a dynamic new economy, is what I call real wealth. That's what works. And that is how a Gore administration will work from January of 2001 on."", 'The second principle -- conscience. We have to respect the dreams of the next generation. We have to do more than pay down our debt. We have to seize this chance to completely eliminate it for our children.', 'Paying down the debt is plain, good capitalism. It frees businesses to invest and innovate. It creates good jobs. It is the foundation of future growth.', ""But putting an end to debt for the first time in seven generations will give our children the chance to reach for their own dreams instead of dealing with the nightmares that others' irresponsibility can cause."", ""A conscientious nation owes this to its children. I believe this is how we reach real maturity and take real responsibility - as parents and as a great nation. No generation should put its own expectations ahead of its children's needs."", 'To win that moral victory for Americans, we will win this fight. And in the four years of my term, I will pay off all the debt America accumulated in our first 200 years. Then I will put us on the path to completely eliminating our national debt by the year 2012.', ""Let us live up to the responsibility of being true parents to our nation's children - not just individually in our own homes, but as a community in our stewardship of America's finances."", 'The third principle is decency. A decent nation honors and protects our mothers and fathers - and safeguards their old age.', 'I believe we must show the same restraint and foresight as a nation that families must show in their own kitchen-table budgeting. That means not just living in the moment - and not just paying off our debts - but also seeing our link in the chain of generations.', 'Decency means living up to our promises. I propose that we set aside enough of the surplus to strengthen Medicare - and then do for Medicare what we have done for Social Security, by putting the Medicare trust fund off-budget and into in an iron-clad lock-box.', 'If we do that, then Congress can never try to raid Medicare, or take it away. We will keep Medicare strong for decades to come. And we will update Medicare to provide a prescription drug benefit for all our seniors.', 'We have to guarantee that Social Security is there for you when you retire. As President, I will keep that sacred trust. I will oppose any effort to make Social Security a gamble, instead of a guarantee. I am not going to let anyone take the ""security"" out of Social Security.', 'I will oppose the effort to privatize Social Security - which could take at least a trillion dollars out of the trust fund, and could drive our entire budget back into deficit.', 'And with Social Security as the unshakeable foundation, people should be able to save and invest more for their retirement without gambling away their Social Security. I propose a new way to help them do that: ""Social Security Plus"" - new, tax-free voluntary accounts that let you save, invest, and build on top of the guaranteed foundation of Social Security.', ""Let me be clear about what this is: this is Social Security plus, it is not Social Security minus. It doesn't come at the expense of Social Security -- it comes in addition to Social Security. It is the best of both worlds - rather than, as the opposition has proposed, the worst of both worlds. You get the freedom to save more and invest more, but it will not come out of your Social Security. Your Social Security will be there for you to rely upon, no matter how those investments perform."", 'The fourth principle is boldness.', 'With our feet planted firmly on the ground -- with discipline, conscience, and decency -- we must also have courage to take bold action, to meet three great challenges: reforming our schools, curing disease and making all of our families healthier than ever before, and protecting the environment that is essential to the fabric of life itself.', 'For each of these three priorities, I propose that we create a new national trust - to safeguard the investments we need for our future.', 'With a new education trust, we will make sure we have the new resources to go along with new accountability. We will invest more in our schools, set higher standards, and treat teachers like the professionals they are.', ""With a new health care trust, we will make our families stronger by making all families healthier. We'll invest in new research that will harness the breakthroughs of science for the benefit of our loved ones. We'll move step-by-step toward universal health coverage. We will bring access to fully affordable health coverage to every child in this nation by the end of the next Presidential term. And we'll make health insurance more affordable and accessible for small business."", 'Finally, the Environment Trust. We will summon all the ingenuity, all the innovation, all the skill and creativity of our country to protect a national asset: a clean, healthy environment. And we have to protect one of the most precious of all our treasures: the stable seasons God gave us.', '- From activists to entrepreneurs, from investors to working men and women -- together we will build new, modern, and clean energy, industrial, and transportation systems.', ""I say to the nation's innovators: If you invest in these new technologies, America will invest in you."", ""There will be no new bureaucracies; no new agencies or organizations, because not only is the era of big government over, the era of old government is over, too. We'll measure performance carefully and ensure that we reach our goals with common-sense standards. And through the power of free markets, through good old-fashioned American ingenuity, we will dramatically reduce pollution and reverse the tide of global warming -- while creating more jobs, not fewer jobs, for our people."", ""America has done well. But I'm here today to tell you: you ain't seen nothing yet."", 'I know America can be anything we want to be - if we do things right.', 'We have the people. We have the talent. We have the plan. And best of all, we have the confidence of the American people.', 'On behalf of those hard-working Americans whose lives have gotten better since we took up the challenge alongside them, I tell you now: we are going to win this fight.', 'On behalf of our children, whose futures are more secure today than they were eight years ago, I tell you now: we are going to win this fight.', 'For the sake of our Earth, which does hang in the balance, I tell you now: we will win this fight.', 'On behalf of the elderly, the vulnerable, the frail, we will not rest; on behalf of those citizen activists who are determined to clean up this democracy and reclaim real, not rhetorical, reform -- we will not rest.', 'Hear me now: we will take the White House in November for these people. I will let nothing threaten their hard-won prosperity. I will let nothing threaten their dreams.', ""If you allow yourselves to believe, without reservation, that we can do what's right, then we will accomplish what we set our minds to do."", 'Come with me, and we will do the right thing - and we will do it well.

But in one of God's unforeseen paths, this belatedly broken impasse can point us all to a new common ground, for its very closeness can serve to remind us that we are one people with a shared history and a shared destiny.
