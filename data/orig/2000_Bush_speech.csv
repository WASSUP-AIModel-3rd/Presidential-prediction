0,George W. Bush ,"June 12, 1999","['What a pleasure it is to visit with you, to shake your hands. Laura and I are so grateful for your welcome, your enthusiasm, your confidence.', ""There will come a time for formal speeches and 10 point plans. But I know the question on your mind: Why are you thinking about running for president? So I'll tell you what's on my heart."", ""I'll have a formal announcement sometime in the Fall. I have come here today to tell you this: I am running for President of the United States. There's no turning back, and I intend to be the next President of the United States."", ""I'm running because our country must be prosperous. But prosperity must have a purpose. The purpose of prosperity is to make sure the American dream touches every willing heart. The purpose of prosperity is to leave no one out—to leave no one behind. I'm running because my party must match a conservative mind with a compassionate heart. And I'm running to win."", ""Prosperity is not a given. Some in this administration think they invented it. But they did not invent prosperity, any more than they invented the Internet. Governments don't create wealth. Wealth is created by Americans — by creativity and enterprise and risk-taking. But government can create an environment where businesses and entrepreneurs and families can dream and flourish."", ""We'll be prosperous if we reduce taxes. I'll have a plan that reduces marginal rates to create jobs, but a plan that also helps struggling families on the outskirts of poverty. I believe that after we meet priorities, all that remains must be passed back to Americans, so it will not be spent by Washington."", ""We'll be prosperous if we reduce the regulations that strangle enterprise. And I will do what I did in Texas: fight for meaningful, real tort reform."", ""We'll be prosperous if we embrace free trade. I'll work to end tariffs and break down barriers everywhere, entirely, so the whole world trades in freedom. The fearful build walls. The confident demolish them. I am confident in American workers and farmers and producers. And I am confident that America's best is the best in the world."", 'We must be prosperous to keep our commitments to the health and security and dignity of the elderly. And we should trust Americans by giving them the option of investing part of their Social Security contributions in private accounts.', 'And we must be prosperous to keep the peace. This is still a world of terror and missiles and madmen. And we are challenged by aging weapons and failing intelligence.', 'I will rebuild our military power — because a dangerous world still requires a sharpened sword.', 'I will move quickly to defend our people and our allies against missiles and blackmail.', 'And I will have a foreign policy with a touch of iron — driven by American values and American interests.', ""America must seize this moment. America must lead. Because America's greatest export to the world is, and always will be, freedom."", 'America will be prosperous and strong if we do the right things. But prosperity alone is simple materialism. Prosperity must have a greater purpose. The success of America has never been proven by cities of gold, but by citizens of character. Men and women who work hard, dream big, love their family, serve their neighbor. Values that turn a piece of earth into a neighborhood, a community, a chosen nation.', ""That dream is so vivid — but still many are saying: The dream is not for me. Kids who turn schoolyards into battlefields. Children who corrupt their wills and souls with drugs, who limit their ambitions by having children themselves. Failed schools are creating two societies: one that reads and one that can't; one that dreams and one that doesn't."", ""These are burdens on the conscience of a successful nation. The next president must close this gap of hope. It is the great challenge to America's good heart."", ""I want to be a president who sets a tone, a direction, an agenda. I will be an activist president, who sets goals worthy of a great nation. I won't use my office as a mirror to reflect public opinion. And I'll be guided by conservative principles. Government should do a few things, and do them well. Government should not try to be all things to all people."", ""My first goal is to usher in the responsibility era. An era that stands in stark contrast to the last few decades, when the culture has clearly said: If it feels good, do it. If you've got a problem, blame someone else. Each of us must understand we are responsible for the choices we make in life. We're responsible for the children we bring into the world. We're responsible to love our neighbor as we want to be loved ourselves."", 'And we must pass this message to our children — teach them there are right choices in life and wrong choices in life. Drugs will destroy you. Alcohol will ruin your life. And having a child out of wedlock is a sure fire way to fall behind. We\'ll love the babies. But the message must be clear: It is not the definition of a man to father a child out of wedlock and say, ""They\'re not my problem, they\'re yours.""', ""Some people think it's inappropriate to draw a moral line. Not me. For our children to have the lives we want for them, they must learn to say yes to responsibility, yes to family, yes to honesty and work. I have seen our culture change once in my lifetime, so I know it can change again."", 'What can be done? Government can help. We can write laws to give schools and principals more authority to discipline children and protect the peace of classrooms. We must encourage states to reform their juvenile justice laws. We must say to our children, ""We love you, but discipline and love go hand in hand, and there will be bad consequences for bad behavior.""', ""But changing our culture requires more than laws. Cultures change one heart, one soul, one conscience at a time. Government can spend money, but it can't put hope in our hearts or a sense of purpose in our lives. This is done by churches and synagogues and mosques and charities that warm the cold of life. A quiet river of goodness and kindness that cuts through stone."", 'So my second goal — one of the biggest jobs for the next president — is to rally these armies of compassion that exist in every community. To nurture. To mentor. To comfort. To perform their commonplace miracles of renewal.', 'As president, I will lift the regulations that hamper them. I will involve them in after-school programs, maternity group homes, drug treatment, prison ministries. I will lay out specific incentives to encourage an outpouring of giving in America. Supporting these men and women — the soldiers in the army of compassion — is the next, bold step of welfare reform. Because changing hearts will change our entire society.', 'And my third goal. We should make a solemn commitment in this country: That every child will be educated. That no child will be left behind.', ""I believe in the power of high standards and high hopes. I have seen what works in my state. Raise the bar of expectations. Measure progress. Insist on results. Blow the whistle on failure. Don't give up on anyone."", 'As president, I will give more flexibility and authority to states — but encourage local folks to measure results for every child. I will praise success — but shine a spotlight of shame on failure. If schools fail, we must be bold enough to challenge the status quo. And I am going to change Head Start — to teach our youngest children phonics so they can read, and the basics, so they can add.', 'Everyone must have a first rate education, because there are no second rate children, no second rate dreams.', ""You've heard me talk about compassionate conservatism. These goals are what I mean."", 'It is conservative to cut taxes. It is compassionate to help people save and give and build.', 'It is conservative to reform welfare by insisting on work. It is compassionate to take the side of charities and churches that confront the suffering which remains.', 'It is conservative to confront illegitimacy. It is compassionate to offer practical help to women and children in crisis.', 'It is conservative to insist on education standards, basics and local control. It is compassionate to make sure that not one single child gets left behind.', 'I know this approach has been criticized. But why? Is compassion beneath us? Is mercy below us? Should our party be led by someone who boasts of a hard heart? I know Republicans — across the country — are generous of heart. I am confident the American people view compassion as a noble calling. The calling of a nation where the strong are just and the weak are valued.', ""I am proud to be a compassionate conservative. I welcome the label. And on this ground I'll take my stand."", ""It is the ground I've stood as governor of Texas, a job I really love. I know it isn't the same as being president. But if Texas were a country, it would be the 11th largest economy in the world. And I've had some successes. We passed the two biggest tax cuts in Texas history. We reformed our welfare and tort laws. We improved test scores for all the children in our schools, especially African-American and Hispanic kids."", ""I've learned to lead. I don't run polls to tell me what to think. I make decisions based on a conservative philosophy that is engrained in my heart. Trust local people to make right choices about their schools and cities. Understand that private property is the backbone of capitalism. Fight for American interests and American workers in the world. Know the importance of family and the need for personal responsibility. These are principles from which I will not vary."", ""I've learned you can not lead by dividing people. This country is hungry for a new style of campaign. Positive. Hopeful. Inclusive. A campaign that attracts new faces and new voices. A campaign that unites all Americans toward a better tomorrow."", 'I say a better tomorrow because I\'ve learned that people want to follow an optimist. They don\'t respond to the message: ""Follow me, things are going to get worse."" They respond to someone who appeals to our better angels, not our darker impulses. They respond to someone who sees better times — and I see better times.', 'I want you to imagine a campaign that carries this message. We will defend the American dream with sound economic policies and tax cuts. But we will also tell every American, ""The dream is for you."" Tell forgotten children in failed schools, ""The dream is for you."" Tell families, from the barrios of LA to the Rio Grande Valley: ""El sueno americano es para ti."" Tell men and women in our decaying cities, ""The dream is for you."" Tell confused young people, starved of ideals, ""The dream is for you."" This is the kind of campaign we must run.', ""For my part, I'm running, and I'm running hard. I know that this race will be competitive. I know the other candidates are good and talented people. And I know I'm late. But now that the Texas legislative session is over, I'm taking my front porch campaign to every front porch in this state. I will tell people exactly what I told you here today. Face to face. Eye to eye. And I cannot wait."", 'It feels to me like an old era of American politics is ending — like Americans are waiting for new hopes, new energy, new idealism. We will prove that someone who is conservative and compassionate can win without sacrificing principle. We will show that politics, after a time of tarnished ideals, can be higher and better. We will give our country a fresh start after a season of cynicism.', ""We have a long way to go, but we start today. And I hope you'll join me."", 'Thank you.']"
1,George W. Bush ,"March 06, 2000","['It is a special honor to be with you today, and to visit this place of remembrance and hope and vigilance. Here we remember the past - including its crimes and cruelties. Here, we imagine the future - as a place where intolerance and hatred have no place in the policies of government, or the souls of citizens.', 'I am pleased to be with friends of the Wiesenthal Center - people committed to the spread of justice and tolerance and people dedicated to a safe and secure Israel. I join you in this important cause.', 'All of you are supporting a great work. For more than a generation now, the Wiesenthal Center has fought against anti-Semitism and all forms of bigotry. Not just here, but around the world.', ""More than 50 years ago, a member of the Nazi SS told Simon Wiesenthal that it wasn't worth telling the story of the death camps - because no one would ever believe such things were possible. Yet now we do not just believe, now we know. We know because Simon Wiesenthal and many others have preserved truths that must never be lost to memory, or sacrificed to revisionism."", 'Our century has revealed both the durability of human hate, and the durability of human hope. In the Holocaust, we saw unending hate and undying hope. Anti-Semitism. once destroyed the moral foundations of one of the most educated nations on earth. It is a fact that barbarism can appear even in the most outwardly civilized society. Tolerance can never be assumed. It must always be taught.', 'We must teach our children to respect people from an walks of life. We must teach our children to respect people whose skin is of a different color. We must teach our children to respect those whose ancestry or religion is different from their own, Finally, we must teach our children that we are one nation, one people, all American.', 'There is a contest of light and shadow in every nation, in every generation Intolerance is not merely a problem of the past Racism finds new targets, and reopens old wounds. Hate groups recruit on the Internet and warp the souls of children. We are called by conscience to set our hearts against all assaults on human dignity. You have answered that call - along with many other Americans.', ""There are two great pillars of tolerance in this country. One is the American tradition itself. The unbreakable guarantees of the Constitution. The echoing ideals of The Declaration of Independence. Our commitment to tolerance and equality under law emerges from the very nature of our country. That commitment has never been completely fulfilled, but it must always be pursued. For all its flaws, I believe our nation is chosen by God and commissioned by history to be a model to the world of justice and inclusion and diversity without division. These are American convictions. Defending them is America's calling. And they must be passed intact to America's children."", '\'The other pillar of tolerance is faith. The teaching of our tradition is simple and permanent: ""Love your neighbor as yourself - Not just because this promotes the peace and good order of society. But because this is the proper way to treat human beings created in the image and likeness of God.', ""Many Americans, of many backgrounds, share the same conviction - We don't believe in tolerance in spite of our faith. We believe in tolerance because of our faith. And it leads us to condemn all forms of religious bigotry."", 'But a leader must do more than hold this conviction. He must give it voice - And he must give it force - That is my commitment to the people of this country - Every American must know they am equally American - no matter their culture, race or religion. And those who practice intimidation and violence will have a determined enemy in the president of the United States. This place bears the name of a man who has never tired in righting wrongs and seeking justice. It is monument to the power of truth over falsehood Your work is always urgent, and always unfinished. Thank you for your commitment, and for your welcome today.']"
2,George W. Bush ,"March 07, 2000","['Phyllis, thank you. Thank you for your dedication to our children, thank you for your work in one of the most important jobs in America, teacher.', 'Tonight, we have good news from sea to shining sea. We were challenged - and we met the challenge. We were tested - and we were equal to the test. We promised a national campaign. And, tonight, we have a national victory. Republicans and conservatives across America have said they want me to lead the Republican Party to victory come November, and I am ready and eager to do so.', 'I commend two good men and tough competitors: Alan Keyes and Senator John McCain. This has been a spirited contest. I congratulate John. We have our disagreements, but I respect him and his commitment to reform. I congratulate Alan for his campaign of conviction. Soon, our party will unite and turn to the main task at hand: ending the era of Clinton and Gore.', ""Tonight's victory is a testimony to the power and resonance and energy of a new message, a message of reform and renewal called compassionate conservatism. Tonight's victory is also the beginning of a great task. I am not only asking Americans to vote for me. I am asking Americans to join with me on a mission to reform and renew our country."", 'From the first day, this campaign has had a cause, a vision of change for our party and our country. Republicans must expand our prosperity -- and extend it to those who still struggle. We must be a strong nation - that also cares for the weak and forgotten, We must welcome the new Americans - Americans by choice - because legal immigration is not a source of national weakness, it is a sign of national success. We are a party of principle. We must also be a party of inclusion - a party with a generous heart and an open door.', ""Tonight, in the other party, Al Gore is celebrating victory as well. I congratulate him and look forward to the contest. He is the candidate of the status quo in Washington D.C., and he has a tough case to make in the general election. For eight years, the Clinton Gore administration has had history's greatest opportunity to reform Social Security-with a growing surplus and a willing public. But they have chosen to demagogue Social Security, not repair it. America needs a president who will make Social Security a priority, not use it as a ploy. As President, I will reach across party lines to strengthen and preserve Social Security not only for our greatest generation, but also for generation next."", 'For eight years, the Clinton Gore administration has multiplied the missions of our military, while cutting its capabilities. As President, I will rebuild the strength of our military and the prestige and stature of our country. We will give our men and women in uniform the equipment they need and the respect they deserve.', 'For eight years, the Clinton Gore administration has spoken of education as a matter of bricks and mortar and bureaucratic mandates. But the real problem in education is politicians who never stop talking, and children who never start reading.', 'For the first time in decades, we are going to dramatically improve the performance of our public schools. As President, I am going to rescue children from failure, and return excellence to American education through high standards, accountability and results. After eight years of Clinton Gore, we have the highest tax burden since World War II. And yet we are told that taxes are, not an issue. Not an issue - while many families are punished by the tax code just for being families. Not an issue - while single mothers can pay a higher marginal rate than a millionaire. It is an issue for these Americans. And so it must be an issue in our campaign,', ""I will take down the tollgate On the road to the middle class. And I will cut taxes for everyone who pays taxes - because the surplus is not the government's money, it is the people's money. The polls say cutting taxes is not popular. I'm not proposing tax relief because it's the popular thing to do; I'm proposing it because it's the right thing to do. I will stand on principle, and I will bring honor to this process and to the office I seek. I will remind Al Gore that Americans do not want a White, Ho-use where there is no controlling legal authority. I will repair the broken bonds of trust between Americans and their government."", 'These are the issues I will raise in my campaign. We need to put behind us eight years of nightly polls and daily attacks, Eight years of partisanship and gridlock and division. Eight years is a long time --and eight years is enough. We are ready - and I believe our country is ready - to return exiled honor to the White House.', 'Someone will make history this November, Either we will ratify the status quo, or we will have a new beginning in American politics. I say: America must not give Clinton/Gore a third term.', 'Tonight, I invite every American, of every background, to join our cause. If you believe our nation needs high standards and new leaders, this is your campaign. If you believe politics should Inspire young people, not disillusion them, this is your campaign. If you believe our country needs a fresh start... a clean break... a rebirth of idealism, this is your campaign.', 'I have so many people to thank tonight.']"
3,George W. Bush ,"March 14, 2000","[""I am grateful tonight for the overwhelming support of voters in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Tennessee. I am honored by all these victories. And it's especially great to win at home. Thank you Texas. When I filed for president, I pledged I'd come home to Texas with the nomination of my party. Tonight we can say: Mission accomplished."", 'With this victory comes a sacred duty. Americans want a leader who will raise our sights. Americans want a president who will keep his oath and his honor. And this is a charge that I will keep. I have brought dignity and honor to the office of Governor of Texas, and I will restore dignity and honor to the office of President of the United States.', 'We have the opportunity of a lifetime, an opportunity to reform the institutions of American government and so renew the promise of our democracy. To do this, our compassionate conservative philosophy must offer opportunity, not just for the few and the favored, but for everyone,', ""Too many American children are caught in schools where fear is common and learning is rare. We will earn the public trust by reforming and renewing America's public schools."", 'Immigrants new to our country are looking for a party that welcomes and respects them And we must be that party.', 'Many Americans, in the shadow of our prosperity, are still struggling, waiting for their chance, and we must take their side.', 'We are halfway - but only halfway -- to ending the Clinton/Gore era in Washington, D.C. To get there, we must face one more Clinton/Gore campaign - The last week has been a preview. The Gore campaign will say anything and try to win at any cost.', 'We will confront their tactics one more time, and this time, we will prevail and they will fail,', ""They will fail, because Americans have caught on. Al Gore can't solve campaign finance problems when he symbolizes them. He can't talk of rebuilding the military when his administration has dismantled our military. And he can't distance himself from the president when, for eight years, he's served as the cheerleader-in--chief"", 'The differences between me and Vice President Gore are many. And nowhere is the contrast more clear than when it comes to the need to reform our public schools.', 'Improving public education has been the passion of my time as governor. It will be the priority of my time as president. I believe that literacy is liberation. I have outlined an agenda of persistent, aggressive reform. I have a mission of change, and a message, of hope.', 'I have a plan that says to failing schools: Improve, or we will rescue the children. We will give you time to improve. By restoring local control, we will give you freedom to improve. But we Will not force a single child to remain in a school that does not teach and will Dot change.', 'Al Gore has gone into low performing schools and claimed my plan would undermine them.', 'Think a moment about what that means. Al Gore has visited schools and told them, in essence, ""You are hopeless-We won\'t set high standards for you, because you win never achieve them."" This is not a defense of public education, it is a surrender to despair. This is the soft bigotry of low expectations, and I will fight it everywhere it exists in any classroom in America.', 'I believe that every student, of every background, can learn to read. And every school, in every neighborhood, should be required to teach.', 'This is a bright and dividing line in this campaign.', 'I want to solve our education problems; Al Gore wants to subsidize them.', 'I believe that failing schools are unacceptable; Al Gore believes they are inevitable.', 'I will work for children and their parents. He will work for the entrenched interests that fund his campaign. I will challenge the status quo; Al Gore is the status quo. His approach and mine have both been tried - and the results are clear.', ""There is an education gap in America, and the Clinton/Gore administration has failed to close it. Poor and minority children do not do as well as the rest of America's children, and I will not rest until that changes. Sixty-eight percent of fourth graders in the highest poverty schools cannot read and understand a simple children's book."", 'But we are closing the education gap in Texas. We are making progress faster than anywhere else in this country. The changes we fought for - high standards and accountability and discipline and local control - are improving the lives of children. And that is the test of true reform.', 'In this campaign, education will be a defining issue, For many Americans it Will \'be a deciding issue. Every child must have a quality education - not just in islands of excellence. Because we are a single nation with a shared future. Because, as Lincoln said, we are ""brothers of a common country."" On this great night, I have so many people to thank.']"
4,George W. Bush ,"July 25, 2000","['I believe you are looking at the next Vice President of the United States.', 'Throughout this vice presidential selection process, my foremost goal has been to select an outstanding individual who is capable of serving as President of the United States.', 'I wanted the selection process to be thorough and dignified. I reached out to a distinguished and experienced statesman to lead the search. For months, we worked closely together to review the qualifications of many impressive candidates.', ""As we worked to evaluate the strengths of others, I saw firsthand Dick Cheney's outstanding judgment. As we considered many different credentials, I benefited from his keen insight."", 'I was impressed by the thoughtful and thorough way he approached his mission. And gradually, I realized that the person who was best qualified to be my vice presidential nominee was working by my side.', 'Before I asked Dick Cheney to chair the selection process, I had asked whether he would consider being a candidate himself. At the time, he said no. He had a challenging and demanding job leading a worldwide company; he was enjoying life in the private sector. But I kept the thought of him joining me in the back of my mind.', 'When Secretary Cheney visited me in Crawford over the July 4th weekend, we reviewed many different candidates, all of whom are impressive. But I continued to believe the best candidate might be sitting next to me. I asked him again whether he would be willing to join me to accomplish some great goals for our country: to save and strengthen social security, to improve medicare and provide prescription drug benefits to seniors, to reform our public schools and to rebuild our military. This time he said he was willing to talk with his family and consider it.', ""Early this morning, I called and asked him to join me in renewing America's purpose, together. So I am proud to announce that Dick Cheney, a man of great integrity and judgment and experience, is my choice to be the next Vice President of the United States. I can't wait for the delegates at our convention next week to hear from Dick Cheney and I will ask them to confirm this good man as our party's choice for Vice-President."", 'The fact that this outstanding man is willing to serve speaks to the power of our compassionate conservative message and its promise for our country.', ""I have to admit: I didn't pick Dick Cheney because of Wyoming's three electoral votes - although we want and will work hard to earn them. I picked him because he is without a doubt fully capable of being President of the United States and he will be a valuable partner in a Bush administration."", 'Dick Cheney has served our country as chief of staff to a President, served in the United States Congress and as Secretary of Defense. He is a man of integrity who is respected by Republicans and Democrats alike. Even my opponent, Vice President Gore, once said Dick Cheney is a good man who is well liked and respected by his colleagues. I am proud to call him my friend, and honored to call him my running mate.', 'I also want to welcome Lynne Cheney. She is woman of many accomplishments. She served as chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities and she is a leader in developing high standards and sound curriculum for public schools. She is an important member of our team.', 'Laura and I are delighted to have Dick and Lynne by our side. And we look forward to winning and working for a better America.']"

They were angry, wary kids. All had committed grown-up crimes. Yet when I looked in their eyes, I realized some of them were still little boys.', 'Toward the end of the conversation, one young man, about 15 years old, raised his hand and asked a haunting question, ""What do you think of me?"" He seemed to be asking, like many Americans who struggle: Is their hope for me? Do I have a chance?

We are their country too. And each of us must share in its promise or the promise is diminished for all.', ""If that boy in Marlin believes he's trapped and worthless and hopeless, if he believes his life has no value, then other lives have no value to him, and we're all diminished."", 'When these problems are not confronted, it builds a wall within our nation. On one side are wealth, technology, education and ambition. On the other side of that wall are poverty and prison, addiction and despair. And my fellow Americans, we must tear down that wall.', 'Big government is not the answer, but the alternative to bureaucracy is not indifference. It is to put conservative values and conservative ideas into the thick of the fight for justice and opportunity.', 'This is what I mean by compassionate conservatism.
