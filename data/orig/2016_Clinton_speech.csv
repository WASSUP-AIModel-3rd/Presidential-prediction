1,            Hillary Clinton          ,"April 14, 2015","['[joined in progress]', ""[unknown student speaker]: I'll be graduating in May, and on graduation I'll be heading to Annapolis, the naval academy, to major in systems engineering."", 'Clinton: All right, good luck.', ""Ellen Charmin, Student: My name is Ellen Charmin (ph). I'm a junior at Monticello High School. I started taking Kirkwood classes my sophomore year. I began taking an online class. I'm currently in the arts and sciences academy. And by the time that I graduate, I'll have 48 credit hours done."", 'Clinton: Really?', 'Charmin: Yeah.', ""Clinton:Year and a half. Wow. That's great!"", 'Charmin: Yep.', 'Clinton: OK.', ""Diane Temple, Student: I'm Diane Temple. I'm an away girl at heart. For the last 21 years I've been a high school as an English teacher.

I'm a 7th through 12th grade principal at Central City High School. We're one of the eight partner schools that partner with the facility to send kids of all grades for opportunities. We're happy to have you here. Welcome to Monticello."", 'Clinton: Thanks. Thank you.', ""I'll introduce...[crosstalk]"", ""Clinton: That's good. That's a good luck omen. [laughter]"", 'McLaughlin: Yeah.', ""Drew Mullin, Student: I'm Drew Mullin. I'm a junior at central city. I'm currently taking auto tech and biotech programs here. I've had a great time. It gives a taste of the college experience. I plan to go on and do something with engineering after I get out of high school."", 'Clinton: Great. Good. Thanks.', ""Bethany Moore, Student: I'm Bethany Moore. I'm what they call a non-traditional college student. I'm taking business administration management, and I also am doing the continuing ed program here at Kirkwood."", 'Clinton: Great.', 'Well, first I want thank you, Nick, for having me here and a few of my friends in the college. I just had a terrific tour of the advanced manufacturing laboratory. I got to talk with the instructor and four of the students, all of whom are high school students who are doing what you have described as the great opportunity to mix your high school years with college learning and college credits as you move forward.', 'And I am really pleased to be at a community college that is visionary and effective and trying to serve as a bridge for people who are non-traditional but coming back to add to their stills all the Beltway high school students who are taking advantage of the opportunities. And the cooperation between the college and the high school is something I want to see a lot more. This is a real model for how we can provide more continuous learning starting in high school but going as far as necessary to help better prepare not only young people but all people for the economy that is awaiting us.', ""And before we get started — because I want to hear from each of you, I want more information about what you see as challenges as students and educators and the opportunities you hope to take advantage of — I just want to tell you a little bit about why I'm here today. I think we all know that Americans have come back from some tough economic times. And our economy and our country are much better off because American families have basically done whatever it took to make it work. But I think it's fair to say that as you look across the country, the deck is still stacked in favor of those already at the top. And there's something wrong with that. There's something wrong when CEOs make 300 times more than the typical worker. There's something wrong when American workers keep getting more productive, as they have, and as I just saw a few minutes ago, is very possibly possible because of education and stills training, but that productivity is not matched in their paychecks. And there's something wrong when hedge fund managers pay lower tax rates than nurses or the truckers that I saw on I-80 as I was driving here the last two days. And there's something wrong when students and their families have to go deeply into debt to be able to get the education and skills in order to make the best of their own lives. I looked at the figures. The average Iowa graduate from a four-year college comes out with nearly $30,000 in debt. And that's I think the ninth-highest debt load in the country. And people are struggling. I met earlier today with a young student who is piecing together work and loans, knowing full well he's going to come out owing a lot of money."", ""We're got to figure out in our country how to get back on the right track. And I'm running for president because I think that Americans and their families need a champion, and I want to be this champion. I want to stand up and fight for people so that they cannot just get by, but they get ahead and they can stay ahead. And a lot of people in the last few days have asking why do you want to do this? What motivates you? I thought a lot about it and I guess the short answer is I've been fighting for children and families my entire adult life, probably because of my mother's example. She had a really difficult childhood, was mistreated, neglected, but she never gave up. She had to basically be on her own at the time she was 14 but she just kept going. My father, who was a small business man, believed you had to work hard to make your way and do what you had to do to be successful, and provided a good living for our family. And then I was thinking, too, about the lessons from my church. You're supposed to give back. You're supposed to do what you can to help others. And that's what I tried to do. And we'll have more time to talk about as that as we go forward."", ""When I got out of law school, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund. One of the projects there was literally going door to door. This was back in the '70s when kids with disabilities were basically shut out of our schools. And thanks to your great former Senator, Tom Harkin, that's no longer the case. But I was knocking on doors asking is there anybody school age not in school, and finding blind kids and deaf kids and kids in wheel chairs who were just left out. And I was able in Arkansas to work to try to improve education there and give more kids chances who really deserved them. And as first lady, to fight for health care reform and keep fighting until we get health care insurance for kids. Then as Senator, dealing with the problems that faced New York after 9/11 and trying to help people get what they needed, the victims' families and first responders. It was an incredible honor to do that. Then, as secretary of state, standing up for our country."", ""So when I look at where we are as a country, I'm so absolutely convinced that there isn't anybody anywhere who can outcompete us, who has better values, who can do more to provide more people the chance to live up to their own God-given potential. But we can't take that for granted. So I want to be the champion who goes to bat for Americans in four big areas, four big fights that I think we have to take on, because there are those who don't agree with what I think we should be doing. And they're pretty powerful forces."", ""We need to build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday. We need to strengthen families and communities because that's where it all starts. We need to fix our dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable money out of it once and for all, even if that takes a constitutional amendment, and we need to protect our country from the threats that we see and the ones that are on the horizon."", ""So I'm here in Iowa to begin a conversation about how we do that and to hear from people about what's on your minds, what the challenges that you see are. And I'll work hard to meet as many people. I'll be rolling out ideas and policies about what I think will work. But I want it to be informed by what's actually working and to build on what works going forward, and to stand up for those who have a different vision of our country, a different one than what I grew up with and a different one than I think is best for everybody."", ""So with that what I'd love to do is just, you know, ask a few questions and hear...[end of transcript]""]"
2,            Hillary Clinton          ,"April 20, 2015","['Clinton: Well, thank you all so much for inviting me here today and giving me a chance to not only learn more about this business, which is a family business, 112 years young.', ""Unknown: That's right."", ""Clinton: And to meet some of the people who work here, as I did when I was walking through, and as you've just introduced yourself. I am excited to hear from you about what it takes to get a small business up and going and keep it growing in an increasingly competitive global economy."", 'Small business is the backbone of the American economy. Here in New Hampshire, 96 percent of all businesses are considered small businesses. And they employ more than half of the workers, the employees, in the state of New Hampshire. So New Hampshire is a perfect example of what it takes to start and grow a small business.', 'And I come from a small business family. My father had a very small business. He printed drapery fabrics in a print plant. And he did much of the work himself, sometimes with day laborers, sometimes with my mother and my brothers and me, literally, taking the squeegee, pour the paint on the silk screen. You take the squeegee, you go down, then you lift it up and you go to the next and you keep going.', ""And I saw where now there's a machine that you just bought that's printing on all kinds of material. And I'm thinking back to those years in my father's small print plant. But he made a very good living because of his hard work and his absolute willingness to do whatever it took to design, to produce, to sell the products that were at the heart of what he produced."", ""And so from my perspective, I want to be sure that we get small businesses starting and growing in America again. We have stalled out. I was very surprised to see that when I began to dig into it, because people were telling me this, as I traveled around the country the last two years, but I didn't know what they were saying."", ""And it turns out that we're not producing as many small businesses as we used to. And a recent world study said that we are 46th in the world in the difficulty to start a small business. There are lots of issues and we'll get into some of those, I hope, Dave, and the rest of you, as well."", ""So I want to hear from each of you, because part of what I'm doing in this campaign is making my own decisions about what we need to do. I want to embed what I propose as policies, not in ideology, not in some philosophy, but in the real daily lives and experiences of American workers and business owners and everybody who had a stake in making sure that the economy is working again. Really, we have to do more for young people, because what we're finding is that with student debt — and New Hampshire has the highest student debt numbers of any state in the country — that interferes with the young people taking certain jobs, buying a house, even getting married and certainly starting a business."", ""When I was in Iowa last week, I met a young man, who — his dream had been to own a bowling center is his hometown. He graduated from college, because he'd worked, like you, during the summers, and he — and he wanted to own that business. He got a chance to do it."", 'With his student debt, it was really a struggle, because even though he was very responsible, he had done everything we expect a young person to do to try to better himself, he was running into real credit problems.', ""And even now, he's got the business, but he runs it — he has a little grill and restaurant, he, with two employees, is trying to make a go of it. Here's a young, ambitious guy. And when I think about my dad, it was a lot easier in those days to have an idea, to get what you needed and to go to work."", ""The other piece of this, as we were walking around and Dave was telling about all of the incredible machines that are used here in production, all but one are from another country. And many of them, if I'm right, Dave, are from Europe."", ""Unknown: That's correct."", ""Clinton: And so you think — I mean, Europe has high wages. They have high costs. Why are they producing these advanced machines instead of us? What's wrong with this picture?"", 'You can — you can see that maybe lower-cost places that are mastering the art of machine production would be competitive, but these are high-value machines. These are very sophisticated machines.', 'How do we get that into more basic production again so that we can resume our lead in manufacturing, something that I think is essential? A lot of people disagree with me. They say, ""Oh, you know, those days are over."" I don\'t believe it.', ""You walk around here, you see these machines from, you know, Italy or Germany or wherever else they're from. Why? Why aren't we producing those machines? What do we need to do to jump-start advanced manufacturing once again in our country?"", ""So my bottom line is, we've gone through some tough times, and I think Americans have done everything they could think of to do to get through those tough times."", ""But now it's not enough just to tread water; we need to get ahead and stay ahead, and people need to feel that their work is being rewarded, that the deck is not stacked in favor of those at the top, that they too have a chance to go as far as their hard work and their aspiration will take them."", 'So in order to put together a set of policies for my campaign, I really want to make sure that they are in line with the real lives and the real working experiences of the people that I would love to represent as your president.', ""So we're going to take on four big fights. You know, we're going to fight to build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday, and make the middle class mean something again in this country. We're going to fight to have strong families and strong communities. And of course, it's no accident that I'm at a [inaudible] whose customer market is between six months and six years. That's — that's right where I am focused these days."", ""I want to make sure we have a functioning political system. I'm going to fight for that."", ""I will work with anybody. I've done that. I did it as senator. I will do it again."", 'But I will also stand my ground when we need to, and part of that is getting unaccountable money out of politics, because we cannot afford that, even if it takes a constitutional amendment.', ""And then finally, we always have to be vigilant to protect our country against the threats we know — we can see them — but then the threats we can't see — pandemic diseases, cyber warfare, et cetera."", ""So I'm excited about this campaign. I'm thrilled to be back in New Hampshire. I see some of my friends out there in the audience."", 'And the first place I ever came for any political campaign was in 1991 when I was here campaigning for my husband, in October of 1991. I celebrated my birthday here in — in Keene, and I have a lot of wonderful memories.', ""So with that, Dave, I'm going to turn it back to you, and — and we can start hearing from some of the folks."", ""Question: I think maybe I'll ask the initial question, and you guys will chime in."", ""But — but, you know, early childhood is obviously our interest and — our selfish interest, but also, we're fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters. And I would like you to elaborate on exactly what you think you might do for child-care in the future if — if you're — you know, if you're elected."", ""Clinton: Well, that's a question near and dear to my heart, because I think every society starts with our youngest citizens. And when I got out of law school, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund. And so my whole adult life, both professionally and my volunteer work, has been around children and families and it is to me the most important commitment we can make."", ""And now it's not only that we want to take care of our children and our grandchildren, but we now know that the way brains develop, thanks to all the great research that is being done by our scientists, that those early years really are critical to the success that a child will have in school and what that child can learn and then what that child can choose to do, what kind of opportunities will be available."", ""So I think we have to start in the family. And I've been working on a project to convince parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, to read, talk and sing to their babies and that's equally important in any child care setting."", ""So when you are producing furniture that give kids a chance to be part of a circle, to work on a table, all of that, it's safety and stimulation are the two most important needs that little, tiny babies have. And I think we need a much more broadly based universal pre- Kindergarten program so that kids have a chance to get ready for school."", ""And I really applaud states — and they are not — you know, they're not all the states that you might think of — Oklahoma has a universal pre-K program because their state decided they would invest in those early years to get their kids better for school."", ""And I think the child care problem, I was looking at a statistic that it can cost as much as $12,000 a year in New Hampshire for quality child care. That's more than the community college costs, as I understand it."", 'And what are we going to do about that?', 'How can you expect, you know, most families to afford that kind of cost?', ""So we've got to do more to support quality child care and universal pre-kindergarten because by the time a child enters kindergarten, a lot of their brain development has taken place, their vocabulary has been developed and so if we want to do well in school — and I know there's a couple teachers or retired teachers out there, you want to have our kids do well in school, it has to start in those first five years and that's where you come in."", ""And you were telling me about a light table and other things that you prepare for settings where little kids are — that's all to stimulate them and give them a chance to develop that brain and learn more so they are better prepared for school."", 'Question: Yes. Thank you.', 'Guys, you want to start off, anybody?', ""Question: Well, my grandson goes to the Head Start across the way over there [inaubible] in there it's filled with Whitney Brothers products, all down the hallways. They're all on coat lockers. In there are all their — are little tables and chairs. And it made me feel so proud that I worked here, that these people were buying [inaubible]."", '[audio gap]', ""Question: — more for substance abuse, help in our area, there's very limited resources here. And we would like to see something in that respect."", 'Do you have —', 'Clinton: Well — Question: — any further ideas?', ""Clinton: I do, actually. I am — I'm really concerned because, Pam, what you just told me, I'm hearing from a lot of different people. There is a hidden epidemic. You know, the drug abuse problem, whether it's pills or meth or heroin, is not as visible as in, you know, 30 years ago when there were all kinds of gangs and violence. This is a quiet epidemic. And it is striking in small towns and rural areas as much as any big city. And at the same time, we see steady cutbacks in drug abuse programs, treatment programs, mental health programs. I see Senator Kelly here and I know how committed she is to trying to get resources."", ""So we're — we've got a perfect storm. We have an increasing problem that's only beginning to break through the service so that people — you know, I think a lot of people are thinking, well, that's somebody else's problem, it's not my problem and indeed it is all of our problem. And we don't have enough resources, so that if somebody decides that they want to get help, where do you send them?"", 'What kind of opportunities do they have for treatment?', ""And I am convinced that the mental health issues — because I consider substance abuse part of mental health issues — is going to be a big part of my campaign because increasingly it's a big issue that people raised with me."", 'And when I was in Iowa last week, I literally heard from one end of the state, from Davenport to Council Bluffs, about this problem and how the state was shutting all their inpatient facilities and there was nowhere for people to be sent.', ""So we've got to do more. We have treatment in the Affordable Care Act, which is a good thing, which we — and we have at least on paper, what's called mental health parity, you know, insurance companies have to care of mental health just like they take care of physical problems."", ""But we are just at the beginning of trying to figure out what this is, and the whole substance abuse issue — I'll just end with this. You probably have read about this small county in Southern Indiana where there was an epidemic of HIV among just people living in the community because they were sharing needles and shooting up some kind of pill that was I guess turned to powder."", 'So now they have not only the drug abuse problem, they have people who contracted HIV. So this is not something we can just brush under the rug and wish it would go away. We need a concerted policy, national, state, local, public, private and we need to try to help young people like the mother of your grandson.', 'Question: Thank you.', ""Question: Well, the drug issue is not really a no-issue here. I mean, as a kid myself, as the son of a minister, of a preacher, the little town that I grew up in, I was the only kid my age who was not involved in drugs of some sort. The dealer lived across the street, the kids used their drugs in the front lawn of the house next door. I mean — and there was no — really no recourse in upstate New York at that time because this little town of 300,000 acres, one town cop, two local sheriffs, that's a lot of territory to cover."", ""So it's not really a no issue but it is certainly an ongoing issue."", ""Clinton: You know, that's exactly right. It's not a new issue, but it's taken a new — kind of a new turn, if you will. And I think more young people — maybe because we stopped the messaging about how dangerous drugs work, because I can remember the same kind of, you know, messages advertising that we would see all the time, you don't see that anymore."", ""And so I think for a lot of young people, especially if it's pills, I think they believe, well, what's wrong with that? I mean, you know it's a prescription pill so that means it must be OK. And they don't know that taking it and mixing it and all the rest is going to be dangerous for them. That's a good point. Yes."", 'Question: Bill?', ""Question: Well, I was in the line with the drugs and things, you made a point that educating the kids at an early age, it might be advantageous to really push the drug issue there at Head Start, you know, just in a — in a way that they'll understand it, no, it's not a good thing to do, even though your friends might do it. You don't need to do this. You don't have to. There's other ways."", 'Clinton: Yes, so starting early.', 'Question: Start it early.', ""Clinton: And, Chris, you hire a lot of people, so you see this, don't you and —"", ""Question: Yes. Whitney Brothers actually does drug testing. It's a pre-employment drug testing in order to come to work here, so we want a drug-free workplace."", ""Clinton: Well, I think that sends a strong message and a lot of employers are either doing that or thinking about that going back to doing it, from what I'm hearing."", 'Is that what you hear from your human resource contacts as well?', ""Question: Yes. And Workmen's Comp likes having it, too, because we haven't [inaubible] machines that people are running and if they're high, running them and obviously there's going to be — someone's going to get hurt."", 'Coordination and everything goes downhill.', 'Clinton: Yes.', 'What are some of the other issues?', ""Jim, like, what's on your mind economically and kind of how you see things for yourself and your family?"", ""Question: Well, thank you. Because my kids are all grown and they're in their late 20s so they're — have established themselves and they're doing their thing, so I don't have to worry about them anymore in the way I used to with young kids. But for myself, I'm getting, you know, up in age and looking for — I've worked for small companies all my life. And most of them have just enough money to give you minimal health care, to, you know, retirement. I have very little saved for retirement because of you know, trying to make ends meet with kids and you know, it's [inaubible] the resources. And the company I just left before I came here a year ago closed their doors because of the economy — they were — they were making super insulated panels for the building industry, which I thought was the way to go."", ""And so when they closed their doors, I was 27 years working for them, left me with — looking for a new job and thankfully [inaubible] you know, Whitney Brothers were looking for my skills to help them with their products and I'm very thankful for being here."", ""But you know, I look at, you know, hope your ideas on health care and Social Security and you know, where are those — where are those heading? [inaubible] probably I'm in my late 50s right now and you know, 10 years from now I'm going to hopefully work less. You know, what's going to — you know, and so, in regards to our company here, [inaubible], what could be done to help you know, bolster our company here to help us all live a little better life?"", 'Clinton: Can I ask you, you worked for 27 years.', 'Was there any kind of retirement account, kind of [inaubible] 401(k), anything?', ""Question: There was initially; that lasted until the economy went belly up back in 2008. And you know, our company went right down the tubes. So it was, you know, people weren't going to, you know, to spend that extra little bit of money to get a better — a better product."", ""And you know, the same what happens here. I mean, we're struggling to try to fight with, you know, the Chinese and other people who are making similar items to us and are, you know, cutting costs and we're, you know, we look at every penny that we put into the — into our products here and try to you know, get everything out of it we can with the CSN machines, with the — with the processes that we use."", 'So, yes, the company I work for was — I always thought was the way to go.', 'Clinton: Well, you know, you really raised an important issue because one of the really big problems we face is that American worker productivity has continued to go up. American workers work longer and harder and more productively than the vast majority of workers anywhere in the world.', ""But it's been very difficult to turn that increased productivity into increased wages and increased benefits. And in some cases, where you have small companies, it's— the margin's just too thin. You know, it's really hard to do that. In some places where you have big companies, they just choose not to. They'd rather stock buybacks than increase the, you know, the wages and salaries of the people who've actually contributed to the productivity and the profits."", 'So I think there has to be a look at the range of different kinds of companies because some companies have the cash and they make decisions that leave out their workers and some people are trying just to keep the doors open and the work coming and be successful and stay afloat.', 'So what we need to figure out is how we incentivize companies that have the cash to do more with it and how we support smaller businesses to be more competitive, to get more market, especially export market.', 'And Dave and I were talking about how important it is for small businesses to have access to market openings. I mean, how do you get the best support you need for a website or for you know, telling other potential customers about your product?', 'How do you compete with, as you say, somebody doing the same thing in China?', ""So I think we have to look at this from kind of the top and the middle and try to figure out what's the best way to do it."", ""On Social Security, though, you know, there is a lot of loose talk about Social Security. And I don't know how people can make some of the arguments they make, because if you look at how dependent so many people are on their Social Security — they've worked hard for it, they retire, they postpone retirement as long as possible because they want to keep working, but they also want to, you know, get the maximum amount of payout from Social Security."", ""You know, the Social Security trust fund, according to the trustees, will be solvent until 2035. So what do we do to make sure it is there and we don't mess with it and we don't, you know, pretend that it's a luxury, because it's not a luxury. It's a necessity for the majority of people who draw from Social Security."", ""So I think there will be some big political arguments about Social Security. And my only question to everybody who thinks we can privatize Social Security or, you know, undermine it in some way is — and so then what's going to happen to all these people like you, who worked 27 years at this other company?"", ""What's going to happen? It's just wrong."", ""So part of what we have to do is say, look, let's everybody take a deep breath. Let's figure out what works and how we build on what works. And let's not get into arguments, as I say, about ideology and rhetorical, you know, attacks and claims. Let's just kind of take a deep breath here as a country and say, OK, we're going to have a retirement issue and people who have worked hard deserve to have enough security when they retire so that they can have a good quality of life. And so I'm 100 percent committed to that."", ""Question: That sort of dovetails with what Mary's situation — and I don't know your whole circumstances, Mary, but you know, Mary worked here for a number of years, quit, and then come back. If you could just talk briefly about why you came back and was it a — was it a financial decision or was just because you were bored or what?"", ""Question: Actually, it was a financial situation.

I just — from my perspective, I hear it everywhere. I hear we don't have enough skilled workers, with technical skills. We don't have enough R.N.s and CNAs. We have a whole missing group of workers that could be employed you know, in our existing industries, and so how do we fix that? Because we don't fix it, we're not going to be able to be competitive.

And when they get done, they are guaranteed a job at $40,000 a year in the company. And so, you know, you don't have to go to the University of Illinois. You're going to get your training right here.

I want you to be able to invest in both maintenance and upgrading of existing equipment and, like that new printing machine you showed me, new equipment, if that's going to make you competitive."", ""I think what we have to do is we have to look at the whole tax system and try to figure out what is an economic investment as opposed to one without economic purpose, because there are a lot of those, where people are just basically playing games and — you know, not — you know, like capital gains was supposed to be, for example, a way to reward people who made risky investments, you know, starting new business, investing in somebody else's business and now it's just being churned. And so we have to take a look at the whole tax system."", ""But I can — I can assure you, I would not support anything that makes your business more difficult to run, because you have a real business and you have real economic imperatives. You are in the production of goods and I want to do everything I can to support goods and real services and take a hard look at what is now being done in the trading world, you know, which is just trading for the sake of trading. And you know, it's just wrong that you know, a hedge fund manager pays lower tax rates than a nurse or a trucker or an assembly worker here at Whitney Brothers."", ""And so I think we have to say, look, if you're doing something which is enhancing the economic productivity of your business and the larger economy, we'll be open to that, but if it's just you know, playing back and forth in the global marketplace to get you know, 0.1 of 1 percent advantage, maybe we should not let that go on. Because that is unfortunately kind of at the root of some of the economic problems that we all remember painfully from '08."", ""So I think that, from your perspective, I would want to be a president who made it as easy as possible for you to be as productive and profitable as possible because you've got 40-plus people whose lives and families depend upon that."", 'Question: Yes.', 'Clinton: Right?', 'Question: Yes, absolutely.', 'Clinton: Yes.', 'Question: Yes.', ""Well, great.

4,            Hillary Clinton          ,"May 05, 2015","[""CLINTON: Oh, hello. Hi, how are you? Well, it's wonderful to be back in Nevada and here at Rancho. I am delighted to be joined by a number of young people who are going to talk with me and all of you about their lives, their stories, and in particular immigration."", ""I want to acknowledge my friend and Congresswoman Dina Titus. Thank you so much for being here. And it is Cinco de Mayo, so that's especially appropriate day for us to be having this conversation."", ""I want to begin by thanking everyone at Rancho High School for hosting us today. I'm looking forward to hearing from each of our panel participants. I have a lot of wonderful memories from my time here in Nevada. I've gone door to door meeting with families not far from the school."", ""I've met with a lot of culinary workers and other workers who keep the economy going strong. I accompany the registered nurse on 12-hour shift at St. Rose Dominican Hospital and then was very pleased to go back to her home and have dinner with her and her kids."", 'And I know how hard hits Nevadans work by the great recession. This date in particular suffered some very tough blows. There were a much higher than average home for closure rate for example, a lot of people lost their jobs or their hours or cut dramatically which made it more difficult for them to continue to make a good living.', ""We now see that this state is coming back from those top economic times. Families have found a lot of different ways to make it work for them. We also saw people once again starting businesses, thinking about sending their kids to college. Maybe doing some home repairs, maybe putting a little bit aside for retirement. But we're not yet back on our feet."", ""We have certainly climbed out of the hole we were in, but now we've got to do more than just get by. We have to get ahead and stay ahead."", ""And there are a lot of ways that we have to think about how we do that together. I think that it's important to recognize that even with all of the hard work and sacrifices so many families made, in many ways, the deck is stacked in favor of those at the top. And I'm well aware that in Las Vegas there is nothing worse than a stacked deck."", 'I want to reshuffle the deck. I want to be a champion for hard-working Americans. I want to work across party lines. I want to work with the public and the private sector. I want people to get back to the good old-fashioned American style of problem solving and setting us on back the right course.', 'Now, to help reshuffle the deck, people have to do their part. They have to, you know, step up and take education seriously. They have to be willing to work hard because nothing is given to you. My dad was a small businessman and when I say that he was a really small businessman, you know, just a few day workers from time to time. My mom, my brothers and I, but he understood hard work was the path forward in the United States. He made a good living for our family and I will forever be grateful for that. Because when families are strong, America is strong. And I am convinced having thought for families going all the way back to my years in law school and ever since, there is nothing more important.', ""Now in this campaign, I think we have to wage and win four big fights. One is to build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday. And that means we've got to be really focused on what is going to prepare young people and we have to start early. Education is the key. But education in the first years of life is essential. Because now we know that brain development really has formed by the time a child is three or four. So, we've got to do more to make sure every child has the best chance to do well in school, to get ahead, to charge his or her own future, to live up to his or her own God-given potential."", ""It's also essential that we strengthen families and communities and that's means we have to finally once and for all fix our immigration system. This is a family issue. It's an economic issue, too."", ""But it is at heart a family issue at. And if we claim that we are for families, we have to pull together and resolve the outstanding issues around our broken immigration system. The American people support comprehensive immigration reform, not just because it's the right thing to do, and it is, but because they know it strengthens families, strengthens our economy, and strengthens our country. That's why we can't wait any longer. We can't wait any longer for a path to fall and equal citizenship."", 'Now this is where i differ with everybody on the republican side. Make no mistakes, today not a single republican candidate announced or potential is clearly and consistently supporting a path to citizenship. Not one.', ""When they talk about legal status, that is code for second-class status. And we should never forget who this debate is about and you're going to meet some of them in just a minute. People who work hard, who love this country, who pay taxes to it and wants nothing more than to build a good future for themselves and their children."", ""We're talking about the young people at this table. They are dreamers in much more than name. They are kids that any parents or grandparent would be proud of. And I don't understand how anyone can look at these young people and think we should break up more families, or turn away more hard workers with talent to help us build the kind of country we all want to see."", 'So, I will fight for comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship for you and for your family across our country. I will fight to stop partisan attacks on the executive actions that would put dreamers, including those with us today, at risk of deportation. And if Congress continues to refuse to act as president, I would do everything possible under the law to go even further.', 'There are more people, like many parents have dreamers, and others, with deep ties and contributions to our communities, who deserve a chance to stay and i will fight for them.', ""The law currently allows for sympathetic cases to be reviewed but right now most of these cases have no way to get a real hearing. Therefore, we should put in place a simple, straightforward, accessible way for parents of dreamers and others with a history of service and contribution to their communities, to make their case and to be eligible for the same deferred action as their children. But that's just the beginning. There's much more to do to expand and enhance protections for families and communities to reform immigration and enforcement and detention practices, so they are more humane, targeted, and effective. And to keep building the pressure and support for comprehensive reform."", 'You know, our personal basis, the first time I ever met anyone who was in our country working was when I was about 12 years old, as I recall. And through my church, I was recruited, along with some other girls in our Sunday school class to serve as babysitters on Saturday for the small children, so the older children could join their parents in the fields because believe it or not when I was growing up in the Chicago area, it was farm field as far as the eye could see. And the migrants, immigrant laborer would come up, through the Texas up through Midwest, up to Chicago, then up to Michigan. And we were asked to try to help out.', 'I remember going to the camp where the families lived and taking care of the little kids, while kids at my age were doing really hard work.', 'And what stuck in my mind was how at the end of the day there was a long road from in the camp that went out to a kind of dirt road in the middle of the fields. And the bus that had the workers from the field down it that came back around 4:00, 5:00 in the afternoon, stopped and let off the parents and the older brothers and sisters and all these little kids started running down the path to see their moms and dads and their big brothers and sisters. And they were scooped up by these really, really tired people.', ""And I just watched this and I thought, they're just like me and my brothers. You know, when my dad comes home from work, and we go out to see him. After he has come back from his day of doing what he had to do to help support us. I've never gotten that experience to the image out of my mind."", ""And so, for me, this is about what kind of people we are and what kind of country we have. And I am actually convinced this is in our economic interest. It's in the interest of our values and it's even in the interest of our long-term security as a nation. So, you know, where I stand. And there can be no question about it because I will do everything I can, as president, and during this campaign, to make this case."", ""I know there are people who disagree with me but I want them to have a conversation with me. Because the facts are really clear. You know, we know how much people who are working hard contribute to our economy, both in what they buy and what they pay in Texas. In fact in New York, which I know a little bit about because I representative for eight years and I lived there now, our undocumented workers in New York pay more in taxes than some of the biggest corporations in New York. So, I'm ready to have this discussion with anybody, anywhere, any time."", ""But let me turn to the people who are living this story. I want you to meet them. I want you to hear from them. And I'm going to start with you, Asther , if you will introduce yourself, and talk about your own life and what brings you to the table today."", 'SILVA: Thank you, secretary. My name is Asther Silva. I am currently a student at the Nevada State College pursuing my degree in history with thesis in pre-law. I arrived in United States when I was four years old. And Nevada has been my home since I was five. I came here with my mom and dad. I had a younger brother here. He is a United States citizen.', ""Fortunately, our family was scammed when I was very young. And because of that my father was given a deportation order. And so know, he's in order of deportation."", 'CLINTON: He was scammed because you hired a lawyer to help you?', ""SILVA: Yes. Well, it wasn't a lawyer. It was [inaudible] who took advantage of the fact that, you know, there was a lot of different immigration programs in the 1990s and people did not understand the differences. And so because of that, in 2001, my father was given deportation order that was not acted on until 2011. So our family in those 10 years did not know he been had that order deportation."", ""Right now, thankfully, because of prior to your discussion, my dad has state of removal so he will qualify for the different action program once the lawsuit that's really an obstacle right now is moved out of the way. And my mom will who is here, she will be able to apply so that we're not afraid that she will be deported."", 'CLINTON: And talk to me a little bit about what you have done in school. How you see your future. The contributions you have already made as a young person and what you would like to do further.', 'SILVA: Growing up, I was really dedicated to school. My parents, they put a really big emphasis on me succeeding because of all the sacrifices they had made. They had not seen their family in 25 years.', ""And so when I went to elementary school, middle school, I was really—I was dedicated. In seventh grade, I was named the gladiator of the year at my middle school because I was the student that showed—ironically the most citizenship. And so just programs like that, but I could not take advantage of them because when once I turned the age of going to college, I couldn't have a way out."", ""I was afraid for many years until finally a counselor at my college, at the college at College of Southern Nevada at that time knew what was happening and helped guide me and I became involved in politics. And knowing that I didn't have to be afraid from myself because there was something, and I met other people that we're in the same situation as myself, which is something that never happened before."", ""CLINTON: Erica—that his mom. Part of our jobs as mom is to embarrass our children at any possible moment, but also when we're proud of them to show that pride. So, I'm happy that they're there."", 'Erica, how did you end up here with us today?', ""ERICA: I'm here to basically share my story. I came to the United States when I was two years old. My parents and I made the journey here after we lost my little sister. They basically wanted to give me a better future. I now have a 17-year-old brother. He's a U.S. citizen. And now with my parents would qualify if the lawsuit was lifted."", ""I'm currently going to CFS. I want to major in political science and psychology. And I'm just here wondering what are your plans to help my community and help my family and help us not to live in fear anymore?"", ""CLINTON: Yes. Now that's why I think it so important that we continue to try to change the laws comprehensively. But as I have said numerous times, I support the president's action in the face of in action."", 'I was personally very disappointed that when I was a senator for eight years, we had a few chances to try to do more for dreamers, do more for comprehensive immigration reform, and we were not successful.', 'And then when I was Secretary of State, I was very pleased that there was bipartisan agreement in the Senate for comprehensive immigration reform. And it was such a good signal that Democrats and Republicans can work together, could solve a difficult problem, could put aside partisan differences. And the Senate passed it and the House of Representatives would never take it up.', ""And I think it would have passed if they had taken it up. But I think that they—the leadership in the House decided that politically they didn't want to do that because they had people who were strongly opposed to comprehensive immigration reform."", ""But I think we have to keep working on it. And that is why your stories are so important because we can't look at it as though it is some kind of abstraction. It's real people's lives and so many people who have made contributions, who have worked hard in school, who have started businesses, who have raised their children here."", ""And as you point out in your family, you have a brother who is a U.S. citizen. So it's—we have a lot of these blended families and I want to do more to make sure that Doca and Dapa and all of the changes that have occurred continue and even expand. I would like to try to do more on behalf of the parents of dreamers who are not necessarily included. But the best way is to get the comprehensive immigration reform in our Congress and try to resolve all of this."", ""UNKNOWN: I'm 26 years. And I have been here since I was one year old. I graduated this summer with a degree in psychology and criminal justice. And unfortunately, when I was 15 years old, both my parents and I we received orders for deportation. And since that day we have lived in fear."", ""Thankfully, because of the production I have some relief, but unfortunately, I can't do the same thing from my parents. Unless the lawsuit again, stop or is dropped, my parents' future isn't secure here in United States. And as a current documented immigrant here in the United States, I stand for me with the 50,000 undocumented transgender immigrants in this country who lack resources to get any legal representation to file within the one-year Deadline for asylum."", 'So my question, Secretary Clinton, is would you lift the one-year deadline for asylum-seekers?', ""CLINTON: Well, I think there's several things about that question that I'd like to answer of. One is I think that people in the immigration system should be represented. And we have made some progress on that, but not enough. And so I am in favor, particularly for young people, to have representation."", ""I'd like everyone to have it. But if we have to, you know, try to prioritize, I would like young people, I would like people from vulnerable populations, who would otherwise not have the support that they need. And I don't think there's anything magic about the one-year. I think that as part of comprehensive reform, we need to look at how we make our entire system more humane."", ""I also—I'm very worried about detention and detention facilities for people who are vulnerable, and four children, that I think we could do a better job if we kept detention to people who have a record of violence, illegal behavior and that we have a different approach toward people who are not in that category. And I don't think we should put, you know, children and vulnerable people into big detention facilities because I think they are at risk. I think that their physical and mental health are at risk."", ""So, these are issues that we should go as far as we can to get the resources to provide support and particularly representation and change some of our detention processes within the kind of discretion that I think the president has exercised with his executive orders. But it's also clear as the president has said many times a lot of these issues can only be resolved once and for all if we have changes in the law."", ""So, I want to protect people. I want more humane treatment. No matter how the law currently is written or how it's enforced. And to put the resources behind doing that and then continue to fight for comprehensive reform. Thank you. Wanda"", 'UNKNOWN: Thank you, Secretary Clinton for being here and hearing our story and welcome to Nevada.', 'CLINTON: Thank you.', ""UNKNOWN: I arrived to the United States when I was seven months old. Nevada is the only place I call home. And I grew up here. I went to school here. I graduate in University of Nevada [inaudible] with two degrees here, education as you've mentioned earlier is one of our strong points as dreamers."", ""And because of it, I'm looking at pursuing a law degree. But, again, the system of immigration messes up my family. [inaudible] in our family."", 'I come from a mixed status family. Meaning my sister is a U.S. citizen who petitioned from my father to change the legal status, and he became a legal permanent resident. When we planned to do the same for my mother, unfortunately, she faces the three tenure bar. Because of it, it was either make the decision to have her either separate our family or keep our family together. And a strong message in the immigration community is keeping our families together, and that is the path what we took.', 'CLINTON: Right.', ""UNKNOWN: Unfortunately, she continues to be undocumented. I have—and what the president executive action, she will qualify for [inaudible], thankfully, but unfortunately with the lawsuit we—it's another obstacle in the way."", 'CLINTON: Wanda could you explain for people who might not know what the three and 10 rule is because it causes a lot of these issues.', 'UNKNOWN: Of course. For example, my mother and I, we entered—the term—legal term enter by infection but we use the term the illegally. My father in his case entered with a work permit. So, he entered legally. And because of it, we faced a 3 to 10 year bar because we way we entered to our journey. We took a different way compared to my father.', 'So because of it, we face 3-10 year bar, we would have to leave our country. We tried to do it the right way undocumented community. But we had to leave the country for 3 to 10 years as a pardon for entering illegally into the country.', ""CLINTON: Well, I think your example illustrates the difficulties of these rules that are applied to everybody under every circumstance without looking at the underlying situation. And you have a sister who is a citizen. You have a father who is now a legal permanent resident. You came here at seven months and you have done extremely well with your education, and you're obviously a very committed young person. And your mother, who kept the family going as moms do would have to leave for the 3 to 10-year period in order to be able to petition for reentry and therefore be determined as legal."", ""That's why I have promoted, ever since, you know, we've been having this debate, going back to when I was in the senate, a comprehensive immigration reform program, similar to what the Senate passed on a bipartisan basis, where the people who have been here and people who have as your family has, you know, contributed and worked hard, you would have, you know, pay a fine. You'd probably, you know, we'd want you to learn English which is not a problem before anybody around this table. And we would, you know, want you to, you know, get in line to get a path to citizenship but you'd be no longer at risk of being deported and you would not have to leave the country for 3 to 10 years in order to be able to try to come back in."", ""So, I think there are—there's agreement among the people who supported the bipartisan bill in the Senate even though—I guess some of them are paying a political price for it right now, nevertheless, it was the right thing that they may get it, it is still the right thing."", 'Because we have gained so much from people who—like your families have come here and work hard and made a contribution. So, thank you for explaining that and it shows how difficult it is in so many families to be able to figure out what to do.', ""And Juan, you have an interesting story because you are a one of those small businessmen.

So, why don't you tell us what you've been doing?"", ""UNKNOWN: My name is Juan Salazar. I'm 22 years old. I came here when I was seven when I was young. I grew up here.

All we want is work and, you know, provide for our families. And we're very united—me and my family. So..."", ""CLINTON: That's great. Well, I think that you put an important statistic, which is nationally, not just in Nevada, so many of the new small businesses are started by immigrants.

I mean I will certainly try to do everything I can to, you know, avoid family breakup, avoid the kind of terrible experience that too many families have already gone through, because they were split up.

I want to go to Yale.', 'CLINTON: OK.', ""UNKNOWN: But, after Yale, I can't really become a doctor since my lack of [inaudible]"", ""CLINTON: well, I think should brag on you. You may be a junior but you have the highest grade point average in the whole class, right? And I think one of your counselors told me it was 4.8.

However, since the delay he really can't."", ""CLINTON: Well, I think it's important to, you know, put faces behind the stories.

Yes. You know, I think that certainty is really important, predictability, regularization, if you will. People need to know what's going to happen. And it is just unrealistic, and I think, foolish to continue to talk as though we're going to deport 11 million or 12 million people. That is not going to happen."", 'And so, when you accept the fact that is not going to happen...', 'UNKNOWN: No.', ""CLINTON: ... right? I once calculated when I was in the Senate how much money it would cost, how many buses would be required. I mean it's just, you know, it's beyond absurd. That's not going to happen. So then, what we have to do is accept the fact we are a nation of immigrants. It always have been. I think it was Franklin Roosevelt who might have said that we started off as a nation of revolutionaries and immigrants. And that has continued throughout our history."", 'So we have to solve the issues that are around this situation that we are faced with. And the facts are really clear about the contributions, the economic consumer contributions, the paying of taxes contributions, and then the young people who work hard and are looking for a place in society.', 'So I know that you each have had very personal experiences. And now is your chance to maybe say what you think should be done and how it should be done so that we have, you know, a debate that is about the realities, not about, you know, the talking points and the arguments. Esther , would you like to start?', 'UNKNOWN: Well, secretary, I think one of the most important things for us is family unification. As you mentioned, 11 million people could not be deported. However, millions have already been deported.', ""We have here with us Victoria. She's also a dreamer who received DACA. She hasn't seen her mother in four years because they had to go back to Mexico for an emergency.

So she's been with a guardian for the past four years."", ""And to me, one of the questions is what will happen to those families who've already been separated? Thankfully, I go to bed every night and, you know, I live in the fear that my parents will be deported, but they're still here."", 'CLINTON: Right.', ""UNKNOWN: I can talk to them and I can see them. You know, and I think all of our stories have very complex issues where Juan working and his family's also makes status family all tired of it. You know, we all have siblings which two to three to 10 year bar. Our parents would qualify for adjustment. Unfortunately, that's still in place."", 'So my question is a little bit expanding on several of those issues.', 'CLINTON: Yes. No, I think that reunification should be one of our goals in Comprehensive Immigration Reform because, you know, we have attempted to deal with this challenge for years now and in the absence of actually finally passing Comprehensive Immigration Reform, a lot of families have been broken up.', ""And that's just really so painful for people who live through it, but even for those of us on the outside looking at it to even imagine what that must be like. And that's why I want to do everything we can to defend the president's executive orders because I think they were certainly within his authority. Constitutionally, legally, they were based on precedent that I believe is adequate. And then, still try to go further and deal with some of these other issues, like the reunification of families that were here and that have been split up since the last eight, 10, 12 years. Yes."", ""UNKNOWN: For me, if there's 276,000 undocumented LGBT immigrants here in the United States, around 15 to 50 of them are trans. So as a lesbian woman, I'd like to know how we can protect our trans brothers and sisters from being put into institutions where they don't identify with their gender identity?"", ""CLINTON: Well, that's what Rafael was also referring to earlier. And look I think that we have to do more to provide safe environments for vulnerable populations. And that certainly includes the LGBT community, also includes children, and it includes unaccompanied children. There are just a—there are groups of people who I think we deserve a higher level of care, because of the situations that they are finding themselves in."", ""I also think that we have to reform our detention system. I've, you know, I'm not sure a lot of Americans know that a lot of the detention facilities for immigrants are run by private companies and that they have a built in incentive to fill them up, that there is actually a legal requirement that so many beds be filled. So people go out and round up people in order to get paid on a per bed basis. I mean that just makes no sense at all to me. I mean that's not the way we should be running any detention facility."", 'So I think there is a lot we have to do to change what is currently happening and to try to put us on a path toward a better, fairer, or more humane system for everybody. Yes.', 'UNKNOWN: I think our court ability is a major factor. Many undocumented immigrants have been exploited. Personally, my parents were actually exploited. When they were at—to this country, they had to work for $2 an hour. That was actually in 1990.', ""I also think that since many of these—many of our parents have actually, you know, had a work in a little wage jobs in order to, you know, to move up. I think it's also important to raise the minimum wage throughout the country and—because I think people deserve to make a living wage."", 'CLINTON: Yes. No, I agree with that completely. I am very much in favor of raising the minimum wage at the federal level. States and some cities are on their own raising the minimum wage. But I think there needs to be a federal floor. And I believe that the Democrats in the Senate are going to introduce legislation to do just that in the week. So I agree with you. Blanca ?', ""UNKNOWN: Secretary Clinton, I think the biggest thing is, as you mentioned, you were going to keep the executive—if elected president, you plan to keep the executive order. But as a down, you mentioned as well that you are going to push Congress. We look forward—well, personally, and I think all of us at this table look forward to a day where we all become citizens of this country. All of us at the table have knocked doors, phoned banks to get voters out there. And we tell them our stories, because it's so important that they're vote not—it's not only voting for themselves, they are voting for us and the future of this country."", 'CLINTON: Right.', 'UNKNOWN: So if and when elected, do you plan to push Congress as your first initiative, to push for a Comprehensive Immigration Reform?', ""CLINTON: Well, it certainly be among my first initiatives. I can't—sitting here today—predict what will be happening. I know that happened to President Obama when he was elected and found out that we were falling into an economic abyss. And I think he deserves a lot of credit for restabilizing our situation and getting us back on the economic upswing."", ""So but among the priorities that I would be advocating for—in the beginning would be Comprehensive Immigration Reform. And one of the reasons for that, in addition to everything we've discussed is as secretary of state, I saw what happens to countries that established a second-class status for people."", ""They do not feel that they belong, or they have any allegiance to the country in which they live and work because they're never fully accepted. That is a recipe for divisiveness and even for disintegration. And there fore, my view strongly is that we are a nation of immigrants. We have assimilated tens and tens of millions of people over the course of our history."", 'UNKNOWN: Yes.', 'CLINTON: We have 11 million, 12 million people right now who are undocumented. The vast majority of whom have proven that they want to be a citizen of this country and we should put them on that path. And those who say, ""Yes, we can do reform, but not a path to citizenship,"" would be fundamentally undermining what has made America unique—the way we have assimilated people, the way people who come here feel so loyal, the contributions they make.', ""So this is not just in my view the right thing to do for America. If you compare us to other countries that did not take that step, you can see what it's done to them. And I don't want to go there. So I very firmly support a path to citizenship in the context of Comprehensive Immigration Reform. Juan?"", ""UNKNOWN: I kind of just want to add a little personal story with what Rafael said. When I graduated high school, I realized I couldn't find any work. And my dad wasn't working as well. And we found a landscaping job, like a labor for a company. And we're actually getting paid $6 an hour where they would work us like excessively."", ""And, you know, I was young. And I was just working really, really hard. It's been to a point where you felt like that you'd be humiliated. I remember we'd been working and that the boss was there. We could not look at him in the eye. We could not look at him, and we could not stop working. We hadn't worked harder. And even if it was lunchtime, you had to be working until he left."", ""And, you know, I was just—there's lots of stories not just like that. There's other stories that we have and I'm through that. It just felt like that and it's really hard. And, you know, me and my dad worked really hard. You know, Timber United —so when he would get home from work, and I would see him limping, I don't like, you know, I don't want this for him which is kind of what motivated me to do something for us."", 'CLINTON: Right.', ""UNKNOWN: And, you know, he's helped me out through all his life and raised me to respect everyone and be honest and, you know, supported me with school. When we didn't have money, I'd still go part-time to see a cent. I don't know how I did it but I was going. And, you know, I just looking out for him. And we can't [inaudible] united so I'm really glad he's like my business partner."", ""CLINTON: I bet he'd say the same thing about you."", 'UNKNOWN: Yes.', ""CLINTON: But, you know, Juan, you make a good point. It's not only about the minimum wage and decent working conditions for people like you and your dad. Often times when I have conversations with people who are fearful about immigration reform, their fears are rooted in the feeling that they're losing jobs that are going to people who are undocumented."", ""And part of that fear has a reality to it is because if people pay you $6 hour, because you're undocumented. Why would they pay somebody who already is a citizen what the minimum wage should be? So my argument is the quicker we can legalize the people who are here, the better the job market will be for everybody because you will not have a group of people who are taken advantage of and you will not have others who feel as though—and to some extent it's true—are losing jobs because this group that is being taken advantage of is paid so much less and treated so much worse."", ""So my argument to people who worry about Comprehensive Immigration Reform and the effect on their jobs, it's just the opposite. The sooner we can get to legalization, the better the job market will be for everybody. Then, employers will not be able to violate the laws—the Wage and Hour Laws for example, because they're not dealing with a workforce that is scared to say anything, or even scared to look at the boss when he shows up on the work site."", 'So this is about everybody, not just about you and your dad.', 'UNKNOWN: Yes, of course.', 'CLINTON: Yes.', ""UNKNOWN: I'll tell you one more question."", 'CLINTON: OK.', ""UNKNOWN: I just wanted to say, what do you plan—well, I know here in Nevada and this county our education—we keep on like lowering the education. A lot of kids aren't graduating. And I feel like we need to reach out to these kids and..."", 'CLINTON: Right.', ""UNKNOWN: ... show them that school is very important and so is higher education. A lot of kids don't even—they qualify for college—there's not an—maybe we need to figure out some other way. I think a lot of the reason is because of funding."", 'CLINTON: Yes.', ""UNKNOWN: They can't afford it and they feel discouraged and they just go on..."", 'CLINTON: Right.', 'UNKNOWN: ... and decide not to go to school.', ""CLINTON: Right. Well, look I think that that's a big part of what we have to do to make sure that out economy is competitive and also to make sure that every young person has a chance to continue their education whether it's a community college or college or a job training kind of program that will give them a good start. And you make a really strong point because it's so expensive to continue your education that too many kids are feeling—and their parents are feeling it's just beyond their reach."", ""So that's why I support President Obama's proposal for free community college which at least get you started and I'd like to look to see how we get the debt under control and give people a chance to, you know, not be burdened by debt which makes it really hard for them to start a business or to continue their education."", ""So this is going to be a big part of, you know, my education policy as I go forward in the campaign because you're 100 percent right. Too many young people today feel like, you know, it's just out of their reach or they graduate with some much debt they feel like they are paralyzed. They don't know what to do. They can't buy a house, they can't get married, they can't start a business because the have so much in student debt."", ""And, you know, then, in Iowa and in New Hampshire, you know, the average student in Iowa graduates with about $30,000 worth of debt, and then, the average student in New Hampshire, about $32,000 worth of debt. They're at the higher end. Nevada is still at the lower end of debt."", ""But, you know, you also have a lot of people who don't have that much in assets and income. So it's all, you know, relative to what they can afford. So we have to do more on that. And I want to put in a big plug before we give you the last word about Rancho because I learned today that this school uses Title I funds to pay for the A.P. exam fee. This is, you know, this sounds a little archane but I want to emphasize how important this is because when you look at high school education, making it possible for more students to have access to advanced placement courses really ups the level of education."", ""It gives kids a leg up if they go on to college because they may have some credit before they ever get there. But too many kids in the past and still across our country don't take the test because—I don't know what it does today—$80?"", 'UNKNOWN: $85.', ""CLINTON: $85. That's a lot of money if, you know, you're making minimum wage or less. So I want to—I really want to—I don't—I hope that the Rancho administrators are still here because—good. The principal is still here. I want to give them a big shout out for using Title I funding to make sure every kid who wants to take an A.P. course gets to and gets to take the exam."", ""So I'm sure, you're going to do some of that next year. [crosstalk] Currently. You have them tomorrow?"", 'UNKNOWN: I had my Chemistry test Monday and I have my Statistics and English Language next Monday.', ""CLINTON: So you're taking three A.P. exams as a junior?"", 'UNKNOWN: Yes.', 'CLINTON: Wow. Wow. OK.', 'UNKNOWN: [inaudible] to education topic?', 'CLINTON: Sure.', 'UNKNOWN: Once DACA was brought open—established, it opened doors for many like myself to school to try Yale, Harvard, et cetera. But oftentimes, the journey ends there and I was wondering if or what was your position or what will you offer in order for us to be able to continue on to our education and become or raised doctors, so on and so forth.', ""CLINTON: Well, I think it's very shortsighted of us not to legalize students who graduate from college and can use their skills to make a good life for themselves but also to give back. We have thousands and thousands of foreign students come to our country every year. And they get a great education in our colleges and universities. And then, a lot of them stay."", ""Well, I want you to be a doctor if that's what you want to be. I mean you've come up to our system, you've worked hard, and then you've done exceptionally well. So I think this is the particular fix in addition to the other fixes we've been talking about."", ""You know, I read an article recently about a group of young, undocumented men who were really interested in technology and they entered a contest against kids from the best schools and companies and they won. And so, you have four kids who beat the best of the best. And they couldn't do anything because they were undocumented."", 'And I am sitting there thinking, ""What is wrong with this picture?"" We are in a global competition and I intend for us to win it. And I\'m about to let anybody who can make a contribution to our economy and our society get thrown away.', 'So from my perspective we need to fix that, we need to remove the fear, and we need to make sure that we give every child a chance to do the best that he or she can. And if that means going to Yale and becoming a doctor I want that to happen.', 'So, as you can tell, I could be here all day because, you know, six exceptional young people, we have some proud parents and grandparents and teachers here.', ""But let me and where I started thanking Rancho for having me here, thanking each of you for being willing and brave enough to sit here and talk about your own lives. I want to reiterate my strong support for the president's executive actions because he had to act in the face of inaction that was not on the merits but politically motivated for partisan reasons which I think is not the way we should be solving our problems in our country, in our Congress or anywhere else."", ""And I'm so pleased that the congresswoman is here because I know she's a champion for a lot of the issues that we are talking about today.

And I have to tell you, I find it, you know, very reassuring because I do have that experience to know what\'s possible and how best to proceed. but I also know that we are living in an incredibly complicated time in American history. It is not a time for easy answers or glib answers or one-liners or applause lines. Those are all great. That\'s part of campaigning.', ""But at the end of the day, we need a president who has both the experience and the understanding to deal with the complexity of the problems that we face. And I appreciate what both Dean and Sarah said about the experiences that I've been privileged to have during the last decades. I really believe that I can go into that office on the very first day and begin to do what is required."", ""So I look forward to visiting with each and every one of you. I look forward to working with you, not only as we move toward the caucuses. I would be honored to have your support on February 1st. And then I will need your help as we move toward the general election because I don't want this election to be about me. I want to it to be about us and the agenda that we want to set for our country."", 'You know, when I campaigned so hard against then-Senator Obama, I was, you know, working as hard as I could. He was working as hard as he could. And at the end of the day, he won. And then I went to work to make sure he got elected our president. And I was so relieved and happy when that finally happened.', 'The Sunday after the election, Bill and I went for a walk in an area that Sarah would know, a big kind of nature preserve near where we both live, and we just wanted to let down because we\'d been working so hard to elect then-President-Elect Obama. So we\'re wandering through the woods, and Bill\'s phone rings, which is sort of a miracle since we have terrible cell coverage there. And he pulled it out of his pocket and it was the president-elect. And he said, ""You know, I\'d like to talk to you and Hillary."" And Bill said, ""Well, we\'re kind of in the middle of a forest. Can we get home and call you back?""', 'And so we did. And when he called back—when Bill called back, he talked to the president-elect and then I talked to him. And he said to me, ""I want you to come see me in Chicago."" And I said, ""Sure. When?"" He goes, ""As soon as you can get here."" And I said, ""Well, OK."" So the following Thursday, I went to Chicago and he asked me if I would serve as secretary of state.', 'And I said, ""You know, Mr. President-elect, I, you know, I really want to go back to the Senate. I\'m very flattered, but there are a lot of other people who could do that."" ""No,"" he said. ""I know what I want and I want you to do this."" I said, ""Well, you know, Mr. President-elect, I really want to go back to the Senate and that\'s where I think I can best work with you and best serve you."" He goes, ""Look,"" he said, ""I don\'t want to hear from you again until you say yes."" [laughter] So, you know, I told him ""no,"" you know, again later. And he just said, ""Don\'t—don\'t call me until you say yes."" And I did tell my husband, I said, ""He\'s so persistent. I\'ve told him no twice and he keeps saying, you know, I\'m waiting for you to say yes."" And Bill said, ""Yeah, well, I asked you to marry me twice before you said yes."" [laughter]', ""So I guess there's a connection there. So then I—I stayed up that night and I—I thought, you know, supposed I'd been honored to win, and I had wanted this incredibly talented American to be in my cabinet and I'd asked him, I'd want him to say yes. And I thought, you know, what's what I have to do."", 'So I called him and I said, ""You know, President-elect, I would be honored to serve in your cabinet."" And we immediately got starting to work. A few months later, on my very first trip as secretary of state, I went to Asia. And I went in part because everybody I called, all of the leaders in the countries that I spoke with, were saying, ""You know, we just don\'t know whether the United States cares about us anymore; nobody\'s been paying any attention to us; you know, we\'re—we\'re kind of feeling like we\'re not important to you anymore."" I said, ""Well, you are, and the president feels that way; I feel that way; I will come see you.""', 'So I went out. And one of the countries that I went to was Indonesia, in part because it\'s a very important country, but also President Obama had a personal connection with it. And my idea was not only to talk to the leaders, but to talk to the people, what\'s called public diplomacy. So that as you were—as I was out there talking to presidents and prime ministers and others, I would also find ways of trying to connect to to tell people, ""Look, the United States really does care about the world we\'re trying to create together, and that\'s part of my message from our new president.""', 'So I went on a—I agreed to go on a show in Jakarta, which was their morning show. And it was like a combination of MTV and a reality show and all that. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. And so I go onto the set and people are jumping and they\'re singing and they\'re dancing. And it\'s called ""The Awesome Show.""', 'So I\'m on ""The Awesome Show,"" and I\'m talking a little bit to the interviewer. And then they ask people if they have any questions. And somebody in the audience says, ""I want to ask you, we saw you campaigned very hard against President Obama; he campaigned very hard against you. He won. You lost. And then he asked you to be his secretary of state. Why?""', 'And I realized, you know, in a lot of these new democracies and other places of course, you run against somebody and you lose, you could get exiled or imprisoned, even killed; not asked to be secretary of state. And so this was a very legitimate question. And I thought, ""I have to answer this in a very, you know, serious way that maybe they can understand in our democracy, you know, we do try to close ranks after we have hard elections,"" at least that\'s what we should be doing. I said, ""Well, you\'re right. We campaigned hard. He won. I lost. I then campaigned to get him elected. He asked me to be secretary of state, and I said yes for the same reason: We both love our country.""', ""And at the end of the day to me... [applause] ...that's what elections are supposed to be about. We can disagree and we will. We'll have all kinds of arguments, even, about the best way to do things. But we should be coming from a place of love—of loving our country and of respecting one another. And we have to rebuild this feeling in our country again."", 'We have too much work to be done. We have too many people who deserve a better shot at a future for themselves and their families. I want to be their champion. And with your help, I will get up every single day doing the best I can to make sure that the country we love is the country we deserve to have.', 'Thank you all. [applause]']"

He had a very small business, printing drapery fabrics and then went out and sold them. My mother, my brothers and I and occasionally a few day laborers would help out with the actual printing process. That's what put food on the table and gave us a solid middle class home."", 'Today, small businesses all over our country have worked their way back from the perfect storm of the crisis, when sales and credit, together, dried up at the same time. Businesses are finally starting to sort out how they can grow again, add jobs, and planning for the future.', ""But the deck is stacked here as well. Ask any small business owner, as I have, and they'll tell you: It is wrong that it is so easy for big corporations to get a break but so hard for small businesses even to get a loan. It shouldn't take longer to start a business in America than it does in Canada and France! But that is the fact."", 'I want to be a small business president. A president who does make it easier to start and run a small business in this country, so it seems less like a gamble and more like an opportunity. We have to level the playing field for our small businesses.', ""First, we need to cut the unnecessary red tape that costs small businesses time and money and keeps new entrepreneurs out. We should scrub federal regulations to find responsible ways to make life easier for small businesses, and we should offer new incentives to state and local governments to do the same, because that's where many of the obstacles still lie."", 'Second, we need to simplify tax filing and provide targeted credits and deductions for small businesses, not just the big corporations that can afford the lawyers and lobbyists to find every single loophole.', ""Third, we'll use technology to expand access for small businesses into new markets, whether it's across town, across the state, or across the world. That's what I did in partnership with eBay in Upstate New York when I was a Senator. We started a public-private partnership to help small businesses that had never sold beyond their local community reach customers very far away."", 'Fourth, and I want to emphasize this today, I will fight to level the playing field for small businesses so they can get the financing they need to build and hire… including women and minority entrepreneurs who face extra barriers. And this morning when I was reading the Des Moines Register — big head line: REPORT: Iowa Ranks Last for Women Owned Business. This could not be a more timely article for our discussion today and although it says Iowa has made some progress it says Iowa has seen the lowest growth in the most businesses owned by women from 1997 to 2015 and women owned companies have the least economic clout in Iowa and all the states and the District of Columbia. So this is a very important issue for our whole county but I think it is especially important for our friends here in Iowa because access to credit can be as important to growing a small business as it is for the big ones.', ""And you shouldn't have to be a Fortune 500 company to get a loan."", ""For many small businesses these loans have always come from community banks with deep local ties. But today those same local banks are being squeezed by regulations that don't make sense for their size and mission. Like endless examinations and paperwork designed for banks that measure their assets in the many billions. And when it gets harder for small banks to do their jobs it gets harder for small businesses to get their loans. We can ease these burdens for community banks without harming consumers — and without easing up one bit on the Wall Street. We should not apply the same restrictions on community banks as those needed by the big banks."", 'Let\'s be clear about this: It\'s not the big banks that need relief from Washington — it\'s small banks and small businesses. We should be doing more to rein in risky behavior on Wall Street and ""Too Big to Fail,"" banks not less.', ""I fully support the regulations in Dodd-Frank on the big banks but we should pass common sense community banking reform right now, however, the republicans in the congress insist on using this issue to give relief to community banks as a Trojan Horse for rolling back the protections for consumers and rolling back the rules for the big banks — as we're seeing right now in what Republicans are introducing — we should call it what it is: a cynical attempt to game the system for those at the top."", 'Our goal should be helping community banks serve their neighbors and customers the way they always have. To make it easier to give our responsible loans to responsible small businesses so they can do what they do best, create jobs and help families get ahead.', ""So I'm eager to hear the ideas from everyone around the table.

We're going to hear from everybody as we go through our event today. I want to thank everyone at New Horizons for welcoming us to this facility. And to all my friends at SEIU as well."", ""We're here today to talk about childcare. But its important to understand that when we talk about childcare we're talking about the economy, we're talking about families, we're talking about fairness, we're talking about all of the values that we believe are necessary to raise healthy successful productive children in society today. I want to say just a few words about what's happening with our economy and more broadly about America's families. Because I think when our families are strong America is strong. And if we don't have strong families its really hard for us to be the kind of strong nation that sets the table for our children to do better."", ""We've come back from really tough economic times. The great recession just really knocked people to the ground. People lost their jobs, they lost their homes they postponed doing things like going to college, they had to keep working if they had a job even if they were at or beyond retirement. It really took a lot out of everybody. And we are in much better shape today in large measure because families made the sacrifice and worked really hard despite the odds. They took extra jobs like some of you they skipped what were really necessities but they figured out how to make them not as urgent a need, like not driving the car as much or not buying all the food that the family required. So everybody made it work."", ""But the deck is still stacked for those at the top. Something is wrong when top CEOs earn 300 times more than what the average worker earns and I heard a statistic the other day that was kind of related to what we're talking about today, if you take the salaries, the compensation, of the top 25 hedge fund managers in America, those 25 men make more than all the kindergarten teachers in the country put together. Now I happen to think that kindergarten teachers and child care providers and child development specialists are really important because they are the people that are helping to get our kids off to a good start working with families."", 'And I\'m running for President because I think everyday Americans need a champion, a champion that gets up every single day and goes to work and goes to bat and does everything I can to help families just get by which is what you were talking about. I want you to get ahead and stay ahead. I want to make the words ""middle class"" mean something again.', ""Now, when we think about strong families being the backbone of our country, we have to recognize that our economy is different and our families are different. I was born in Chicago and the families of today are not exactly the same as the family I was born into. Most families need two incomes or two jobs if there is only one parent to make ends meet. And 40 percent of moms, just like LaKeisha, are now the sole or the primary breadwinners in their household. So that's a big different from the way it was when I and others here were growing up. Yet we haven't adjusted our economy or our government programs to take those differences into account. You know I can remember very well when I was a young lawyer before I had my daughter in my law firm where I worked in Arkansas, around 3 o'clock I'd see all the women who worked there sort of whispering into their phones and I didn't know why, but it was just like clockwork, well they were trying to make sure their kids got home safely because their kids were walking home or getting off the bus and going home waiting for mom to get home. And it wasn't accepted back then that you could be a good worker and a devoted parent at the same time, especially for women. But that kind of juggling act is what most of us do all the time now and therefore we have to adjust how we support families so that you can be the best you can be and how we support small businesses like so many child care providers so you can make a living while you do what you love."", ""So we know that with Moms and Dads squeezing every minute out of a 24-hour day and with you Mary Carmen saying you work 17 hours, it's hard to even find time to breathe. And many can't count on anybody being there to help you because everyone you know is working hard and trying to make ends meet."", ""So finding high quality, affordable, flexible childcare is more important than ever. But it's also harder than ever."", ""Federal and state funding for childcare has not kept up with changing times and rising demand. So it's no surprise that out-of-pocket childcare costs for families have soared by nearly 25 percent over the past decade. And now the Republican budget that is being worked on by the Congress would cut funding even more. Making it so much more difficult. America cannot turn its back on our children and our working parents. Family values are economic values. I'm going to be putting forth plans to fix this. We should do it now. And Republicans should either get on board or get out of the way."", ""Because it's now time for us to face reality. Our families need new solutions today, they need real help not promises. And I'm very clear about what I think needs to be done but I want to hear from all of you because what I'm doing in traveling around the country is taking ideas I have, some of which I have been developing for many years, but hearing from people on the front lines, whether its immigration or small business or today child care."", 'First, to bring down out-of-control family costs, we need to make investments in childcare a national priority.', ""What President Obama has proposed is a good start. I'll look for responsible ways to go even further, whether it's providing tax cuts to new parents or grants to states targeted for infants and toddlers. Whatever its going to take to give both LaKeisha and the providers more opportunities. And you know its embarrassing, I traveled to 112 countries as your Secretary of State, there are only 9 countries left in the world that have no form of paid family leave, and we are one of them. And the other ones are tiny countries, countries without many resources. Every other country has something that says, we think it's really important that moms bond with their newborn babies, we think its important that a dad can have some time, we think it's important that children can take care of their parents as those parents maybe are ill or failing. So we've got to have better systems in place with more support and we have to focus on quality so that all our kids have access to the best possible care. And many of you know how hard that is because you have two people helping you take care of 16 children. There are a lot of places where there would be one person trying to take care of 16 children. We have to reducing overcrowding and increasing training and most importantly we have to increase wages. Because you expect to make a living doing the most important job in the world if you have to sacrifice your own family. That doesn't make any sense to me at all."", 'So to all the childcare workers here today, I want you to know that the service and care you provide strengthens our economy, it strengthens families and helps prepare children. You should be valued for that, respected for that, and you should be paid for that.', ""Now I am a new Grandmother and it's really wonderful but just being around my new 7 1/2 month old granddaughter just reinforces what I believe, which is when when we short-change childcare workers, we short-change kids and short-change Americans' future. It makes it harder to retain the best staff. It makes it harder to keep up those high standards."", 'So we have to stand firmly together and united on behalf of your right to organize, your right to bargain collectively, your right to fighting together for the higher wages that reflect the value of your work. There is nothing more important to the family or to the support of the family, which you are, than caring for our youngest children.', ""That's why I so respect the vital work that SEIU is doing, under the leadership of President Mary Kay Henry, is so vital. I think it is absolutely essential."", ""And I want to say something else about it, when people talk to me about the need to improve our educations system, I agree, because I want every child to have the best possible education. But education starts at birth. Education starts when that little baby comes into the world. In fact we now know, because of brain research, that about 80% of the brain is actually developed by the age of 3 and 4. If we don't take care of our babies we are short changing them on their brain development and then when we get to kindergarten no matter how hard they try, no matter how much their mom says do your best, do your homework, no matter how hard their teacher works they're going to be at a disadvantage. That's wrong, it isn't right that a child like my grandchild will have all of these opportunities because we're reading and we're talking and we're singing but we're not working 17 hour days and we're not trying to get by on $5100 after the expenses are paid. So yea, we're going to make sure that Charlotte has every chance in the world but I want every baby, everyone your babies and every baby you take care of to have exactly the same chances."", ""Ultimately, this is, for me, about how we work together to give every child the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. You see it in their faces when they are put in your arms from the very first minute. You want to keep that light in their eyes, you want to make sure they have every opportunity to fulfill that God-given potential. And I'm here because I want to help you and the parents you serve unlock that potential, when we unlock the full potential of every American, we can unlock the full potential and prosperity of America."", ""So for me, this is as important an as anything else that I'm going to talk about in my campaign for president.

It took a lot of determination, and across America we're beginning to see the results of all that hard work. And I will say that there does seem to be a pattern, Democratic presidents, and there are two in particular that I'm thinking of, over the last 35 years, seem to inherit a mess of problems. Have you noticed that? So then they have to dig us out of the ditches they find themselves in and put us back on the right track, and of course I'm talking about Bill Clinton and Barrack Obama, but of course presidents don't do it alone—they do it with the American people.

And it was a good decent middle-class life that he provided to my brothers and me. And I am so grateful, and there was never in my mind in fact that's what so many of us believed when we were growing up.

The more we can bring it out from under the table to put it on top, the more information we can have to advocate for ourselves and advocate for each other.', 'Third, we need to raise wages for the lowest paid jobs in America -- which are, they are disproportionately held by women, especially women of color—we need to make it easier for more women to enter higher paying fields like science and engineering and technology. But I want to say something that a lot of people may not know even in this room full of activist and well informed democrats.', 'In most states today, waitresses, bartenders, hairstylists, and others who rely on tips are paid even lower than minimum wage.', 'Some are paid as little as two dollars and thirteen cents an hour. And they are also more likely to face exploitation, wage theft, and sexual harassment. Think about somebody you may know, think about the mom trying to succeed at work and give her kids the support they need with a job that pays her $2.13 an hour. And forces her to put up with some pretty awful behavior by clients or customers or bosses to try to get those tips to at least push it up to the federal minimum wage level.', 'And finally, we need workplace policies like paid leave and flexible scheduling that allow parents to take care of their obligations at home without sacrificing pay at work.', ""Now, it's no secret that on equal pay and so many other issues, we're up against some pretty powerful forces, political and economic, that will do say and spend whatever it takes to advance a very different vision for America. I'm here to tell you I'm not afraid to take them on."", ""You know I've spent my adult life going to bat for children, families, and our country."", ""And I do know how hard this job I'm seeking is. I have seen it up close and personal. You're not going to catch me wondering what it's like. Instead I'm spending my time planning for what I will do for you when I get there."", ""All our Presidents come into office looking so vigorous. Think about what they look like on inauguration day and then we watch them they grow grayer and grayer, and by the time they leave they're as white as the building they live in."", ""Well, let me tell you, I may not be the youngest candidate in this race. But I have one big advantage. I've been coloring my hair for years. So you're not going to see me turn white in the White House. And you're also not going to see me shrink from a fight. I think by now people know I don't quit."", ""So I hope you'll join me. I hope you'll help me build this campaign, make it your own. Tell your friends to go to hillaryclinton.com, sign up to volunteer."", ""This election is not about me. It's about us. And it has to be about what we will do together to restore faith, confidence and optimism in the future and the country we love."", 'I want to end with a story, some of you might remember we had a pretty vigorous campaign in 2008.', ""I vaguely recall. And both President Obama and I worked really hard and he won and I lost and then I went to work to make sure he'd win. And I was so relieved, I was just so relieved when finally November 2008 came around and he did."", 'And then a few days after the election, my husband and I were taking a walk in a little forested area near where we live, and his phone went off, and he answered it, and it was the president-elect, who said, ""Bill, I need to talk to you, and I want to talk to Hillary."" And Bill said, ""Well, we\'re in the middle of a forest, but as soon as we get home we\'ll call."" So we did, and the president-elect talked to Bill about the ideas he had and the cabinet and economic problems that he was all of a sudden being confronted with that he hadn\'t even been told about to the extent they were. So Bill talked to him and then hands me the phone, and the president-elect says, ""I want you to come to Chicago to meet with me."" And so I said, ""Certainly, when would you like me to come?"" And he says, ""As soon as you can come."" And I thought he wanted to talk to me about what I would do in the Senate to try to support what he was going to be championing as president.', 'So I went a few days later, go into this big office building and sit down with the president-elect, and he says to me, ""I want you to be my secretary of state."" And I said ""Well, Mr. President-elect, I\'m honored, I\'m flattered, but there are so many other people,"" and I gave him names of people that I thought would have been great secretaries of state. And he says, ""No, no, I have to spend all my time dealing with this economy, it\'s worse than we were even told, and yet we have all these problems around the world and I need somebody who I can send out there to go anywhere to talk to anyone, and I want it to be you."" I said, ""Well, I can\'t tell you how moved I am, but I have to go back to the Senate."" And he said, ""Now, I don\'t want to hear from you until you say yes."" So I go back to the airport and get on the plane. I go back to New York and I\'m thinking, you know, the right thing for me is to stay in the Senate, the people of New York had had a rough time. I became senator, and eight months later we had 9/11, and so I had spent most of my first term trying to help people and rebuild our city and protect it and everything and I just thought I needed to go back.', 'So I called the president-elect and said, ""You know, again I cannot tell you how honored I am, and I will support you in any way I can, but I need to go back to the Senate, and so I must say no, Mr. President elect."" He said, ""I told you I didn\'t want to hear from you until you\'re ready to say yes."" And so I say to my husband, you know, ""Can you believe this? I mean the president-elect has asked me to be secretary of state, I told him no twice, and he says he\'s not going to give up until I say yes."" Bill says, ""Well as I remember it, I asked you to marry me twice before you said yes. He said you might stop and think that maybe there is a pattern here."" So I stayed up all night ,and I thought, you know, suppose it had been reversed, and I had been fortunate enough to win, and I wanted somebody to be in my cabinet that I knew I could rely on and I had asked the president-elect. I would have wanted him to say yes, because the country was facing some very serious decisions. So I called him back the next day, and I said ""OK, Mr. President, I am honored, I will be your secretary of state,"" and from that moment on we began to talk and to work together.', ""Fast forward to my first trip I go to Asia in February 2009, and I go because when I started calling presidents, prime ministers, and foreign ministers. They all said we didn't know what to expect because nobody's been paying a lot of attention to us. And I said well that is going to change, because the president and I see Asia as a very important priority, and I will come, so I was on my way."", ""One of the countries I was going to was Indonesia, and I agreed to do both the private meetings with the leaders and press conferences, the kinds of things you see on TV, and to do a lot of what's called public diplomacy, where we would reach out to people, and we would basically say, we care about you we're back we want to work with you. Let's try to find ways that we can be partners and send a different message."", 'So I agreed to go on this show in Jakarta called the ""Awesome Show."" And it was the early morning show, and it was unlike anything I\'ve even seen on our TV, and you know you see anything on our TV these days, people are jumping up and down, they\'re singing, they\'re dancing, and I\'m sitting here thinking, ""Oh my gosh, I hope they don\'t ask me to sing or dance"". But thankfully they didn\'t. They did an interview, and then they said the audience, ""Does anybody have any questions?"" So somebody raised a hand and was called on. So this person said, ""I want to ask you something. We followed your election."" I found that people overseas followed our election, in some ways closer than some Americans, really followed it, and so this questioner said, ""We followed your election, it was really a hard, long-fought election"" because as you know our elections last forever compared to most other countries which have elections. And he says, ""We saw you and President Obama going at it, he was saying bad things about you, you were saying back things about him, and then all of a sudden you end up as his secretary of state? How does that work?"" And I thought, you know this is a really serious question, because in lots of places you run against somebody, you can be exiled, imprisoned, or killed, not made Secretary of State, so I thought that there was a moment here that if I could rev my brain up that maybe could reach particularly young people because Indonesia is a relatively young democracy. So I said, ""You\'re right, we ran a very hard campaign against each other. He won, I lost, and then I went to work for him because he and I shared many of the same positions about what should be done in the next presidency and then he won and then he asked me to be Secretary of State for the same reason, we both love our country.""', ""And no matter how hard this election or any election becomes we should remember that at the core we can have disagreements, and we will, we have different governing philosophies, we have different views about what works, what the evidence shows works about economic policies, that's all fair game, but we should show more respect toward each other and we should remember why we're doing this, because we love our country, and we want it to be the country of hope and potential for our children and our grandchildren that many of us saw come into being over the last decades so as I run for President we're going to have some very difficult challenges. We'll have disagreements, we'll have debates, but I want you to know that I will be remembering what I think should be at the core of every political campaign, how we treat one another, and how we care for this gift we've been given, the United States of America. Thank you very much.""]"
9,            Hillary Clinton          ,"June 04, 2015","[""Wow! Thank you so very much. I cannot tell you how personally honored I am to be here with all of you, to be at this historic institution. Let me start by thanking President Rudley, everyone at Texas Southern university. It's a great treat to be here, to have heard just briefly from Dr. Rudley and others about the incredible programs and progress and the fact that you graduated more than 1,000 young people into the world not so many days ago. This institution is the living legacy, the absolute embodiment of Heman Marion Sweatt and the long struggle for civil rights. and for me, to be surrounded by so many here in Houston, Texas, and indeed from across our country, who were part of that movement is especially touching. I am delighted to be here with my friend, Sheila Jackson Lee, she has been a tireless champion for the people of the 18th District and state and the country."", ""I have to tell you though I thought she would tell you about the most important news coming out of Congress. And that is she is finally a member of the grandmother's club. And as a member of now a little over eight months, it is the best club you will ever be a member of, Sheila. I have to tell you I was excited to come here and to talk about an issue that is important to Barbara Jordan and should be important to all of us. But to do so in front of Dr. Freeman is a little daunting. I mean anyone who knows what this man has meant, not only to Barbara Jordan but to so many who have studied here who have been in anyway effected by his brilliant teaching, elocution and delivery would be a little daunted too. I noticed that both Dr. Rudley and Dr. Sheila both got off before Dr. Freeman came up."", ""I also want to say my thoughts and prayers are with all the families in Houston and across Texas affected by the recent terrible flooding. And I am confident that this community will embrace them. I remember very well coming here after Katrina with my husband, and in fact we decided to invite along a young Senator from Illinois by the name of Barack Obama, along and with Sheila and other leaders in the community. We toured the facilities that Houston had provided to those who were fleeing that horrific storm. And I saw how people had opened their hearts and their homes. This is a city that knows how to pull together, and I'm confident you'll do so again on behalf of those who are suffering from this latest terrible disaster."", 'And it is also a special moment to be here, knowing that Barbara Jordan was succeeded by Mickey Leland and the 18th District was so well represented for so long, and I am delighted to be here with Alison and to remember the pioneering work he did on behalf of children and the poor and hungry. So many issues that he was the champion of. And I want to thank Rosemary McGowan and all the friends and loved ones of Barbara Jordan here today. This is such a particular honor for me because the award is in memory of one of my true personal heroes—a woman who taught me and so many others the meaning of courage and determination in the pursuit of justice.', ""I first met Barbara Jordan when I was a young attorney and had been given a position working for the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee investigating Richard Nixon, and it was such a profound moment in American history. And there wasn't anyone who was a more effective eloquent inquisitor than Barbara Jordan."", 'As a 26-year-old fresh out of law school, as some of you are perhaps now having graduated from the Thurgood Marshall School here at TSU, I was riveted and not a little intimidated to tell you the truth by this unstoppable Congresswoman from Texas. I got to talk with her, which was thrilling, I got to hand her papers, which was equally exciting, but mostly I got to watch and listen to her.', 'At a time of shaken confidence, she stirred the entire nation with her words.', 'Remember what she said: ""My faith in the Constitution is whole, it is complete; it is total.""', 'It was that passion and moral clarity that took Barbara Jordan from the TSU and the halls of Texas legislature all the ways to the halls of Congress. The first woman and the first African American ever elected to represent Texas in the House of Representatives.', 'And she defended and continued the civil rights legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and her friend and mentor President Lyndon Johnson—and in particular she was a staunch advocate for the Voting Rights Act, which had helped make it possible for her to be elected.', 'In 1975, in the face of fierce opposition, Barbara Jordan led the fight to extend the special protections of the Voting Rights Act to many more Americans, including Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, and Asian Americans as well.', 'And like every woman who has run for national office in this country in the last four decades, I stand here on the shoulders of Barbara Jordan and so does our entire country.', 'And boy do we miss her. We miss her courage, we also miss her humor, she was funny and most of all her irresistible voice.', 'I remember talking to her and Ann Richards one time. And between the two of them, forget trying to get a word in at all. And they were telling me about how they would love to go to the University of Texas women\'s basketball games. Right, and Barbara would be there by that time in her wheelchair, and Ann would be holding court right next to her. And Barbara would be yelling directions like she was, you know, the coach. ""Why are you doing that? Jump higher! That\'s not a pass!"" You know, all of those kinds of sideline comments. And so Ann was telling me this, with Barbara right there and I finally turned to her and said, ""Barbara, encourage these young women, don\'t just criticize them."" And Barbara turned around and said, ""When they deserve it, I will.""', 'We sure could use her irresistible voice. I wish we could hear that voice one more time.', 'Hear her express the outrage we feel about the fact that 40 years after Barbara Jordan fought to extend the Voting Rights Act, its heart has been ripped out.', ""And I wish we could hear her speak up for the student who has to wait for hours for his or her right to vote. For the grandmother who's turned away from the polls because her driver's license expired. For the father who's done his time and paid his debt to society but still hasn't gotten his rights back."", ""Now we know, unfortunately, Barbara isn't here to speak up for them and so many others. But we are. And we have a responsibility to say clearly and directly what's really going on in our country—because what is happening is a sweeping effort to disempower and disenfranchise people of color, poor people, and young people from one end of our country to the other."", 'Because since the Supreme Court eviscerated a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, many of the states that previously faced special scrutiny because of a history of racial discrimination have proposed and passed new laws that make it harder than ever to vote.', 'North Carolina passed a bill that went after pretty much anything that makes voting more convenient or more accessible. Early voting. Same-day registration. The ability of county election officials to even extend voting hours to accommodate long lines.', 'Now what possible reason could there be to end pre-registration for 16- and 17-year-olds and eliminate voter outreach in high schools?', 'We should be doing everything we can to get our young people more engaged in democracy, not less.', 'In fact I would say it is a cruel irony—but no coincidence—that Millennials, the most diverse, tolerant, and inclusive generation in American history, are now facing so much exclusion.', ""And we need look no further than right here in Texas.

Krystal takes her responsibilities as a citizen so seriously that not only did she register to vote in Texas, where she was living and would be for a number of years, she even became a deputy registrar to help other people vote as well. But this past year, when she showed up at her local polling place with a Wiley College ID, she was turned away.', 'Experts estimate that hundreds of thousands of registered voters in Texas may face similar situations.', 'And while high-profile state laws like those in Texas and North Carolina get most of the attention, many of the worst offenses against the right to vote actually happen below the radar.

Or scrap language assistance for non-English speakers—something Barbara Jordan fought so hard for.', 'Without the pre-clearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act, no one outside the local community is likely to ever hear about these abuses, let alone have a chance to challenge them and end them.', ""It's not a surprise for you to hear that studies and everyday experiences confirm that minority voters are more likely than white voters to wait in long lines at the polls. They are also far more likely to vote in polling places with insufficient numbers of voting machines."", ""In South Carolina, for example, there's supposed to be one machine for every 250 voters. But in minority areas, that rule is just often overlooked. In Richland Country, nearly 90 percent of the precincts failed to meet the standard required by law in 2012. Instead of 250 voters per machine, in one precinct it was more than 430 voters per machine. Not surprisingly, people trying to cast a ballot there faced massive delays."", 'Now there are many fair-minded, well-intentioned election officials and state legislators all over this country. But this kind of disparity that I just mentioned does not happen by accident.', 'Now some of you may have heard me or my husband say one of our favorite sayings from Arkansas, of course I learned it from him. ""You find a turtle on a fence post, it did not get there on its own."" Well, all of these problems with voting did not just happen by accident. And it is just wrong, it\'s wrong to try to prevent, undermine, inhibit Americans\' rights to vote. Its counter to the values we share. And at a time when so many Americans have lost trust in our political system, it\'s the opposite of what we should be doing in our country.', 'This is the greatest, longest-lasting democracy in the history of the world. We should be clearing the way for more people to vote, not putting up every roadblock anyone can imagine.', 'Yet unfortunately today, there are people who offer themselves to be leaders whose actions have undercut this fundamental American principle.', 'Here in Texas, former Governor Rick Perry signed a law that a federal court said was actually written with the purpose of discriminating against minority voters. He applauded when the Voting Rights Act was gutted, and said the lost protections were ""outdated and unnecessary.""', 'But Governor Perry is hardly alone in his crusade against voting rights.', 'In Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker cut back early voting and signed legislation that would make it harder for college students to vote.', 'In New Jersey, Governor Christie vetoed legislation to extend early voting.', 'And in Florida, when Jeb Bush was governor, state authorities conducted a deeply flawed purge of voters before the presidential election in 2000.', 'Thankfully in 2004 a plan to purge even more voters was headed off.', 'So today, Republicans are systematically and deliberately trying to stop millions of American citizens from voting. What part of democracy are they afraid of?', 'I believe every citizen has the right to vote. And I believe we should do everything we can to make it easier for every citizen to vote.', ""I call on Republicans at all levels of government with all manner of ambition to stop fear mongering about a phantom epidemic of election fraud and start explaining why they're so scared of letting citizens have their say."", ""Yes, this is about democracy. But it's also about dignity. About the ability to stand up and say, yes, I am a citizen. I am an American. My voice counts. And no matter where you come from or what you look like or how much money you have, that means something. In fact, it means a lot."", 'I learned those lessons right here in Texas, registering voters in south Texas down in the valley in 1972.', ""Some of the people I met were, understandably, a little wary of a girl from Chicago who didn't speak a word of Spanish. But they wanted to vote. They were citizens. They knew they had a right to be heard. They wanted to exercise all the rights and responsibilities that citizenship conveys. That's what should matter because when those rights are denied to anyone, we're all the worse for it. It doesn't just hold back the aspirations of individual citizens. It holds back our entire country."", ""That's why, as a Senator, I championed a bill called the Count Every Vote Act. If it had become law, it would have made Election Day a federal holiday and mandated early voting opportunities. Deceiving voters, including by sending flyers into minority neighborhoods with false voting times and places, would have become a federal crime. And many Americans with criminal convictions who had paid their debts to society would have finally gotten their voting rights back."", 'Well today, with the damage to the Voting Rights Act so severe, the need for action is even more urgent.', 'First, Congress should move quickly to pass legislation to repair that damage and restore the full protections that American voters need and deserve.', 'I was in the Senate in 2006 when we voted 98 to zero to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act after an exhaustive review process.', 'There had been more than 20 hearings in the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. Testimony from expert witnesses. Investigative reports documenting continuing discrimination in covered jurisdictions. There were more than 15,000 pages of legislative record. Now that is how the system is supposed to work. You gather the evidence, you weigh it and you decide. And we did 98 to nothing. We put principle ahead of politics. That is what Congress needs to do again.', ""Second, we should implement the recommendations of the bipartisan presidential commission to improve voting. That commission was chaired by President Obama's campaign lawyer and by Governor Mitt Romney campaign's lawyer. And they actually agreed. And they set forth common sense reforms, including expanding early, absentee, and mail voting. Providing online voter registration. Establishing the principle that no one should ever have to wait more than 30 minutes to cast your vote."", 'Third, we should set a standard across our country of at least 20 days of early in-person voting everywhere—including opportunities for weekend and evening voting. If families coming out of church on Sunday before an election are inspired to go vote, they should be free to do just that. And we know that early in-person voting will reduce those long lines and give more citizens the chance to participate, especially those who have work or family obligations that make it difficult to get to the polls on Election Day.', ""It's not just convenient—it's also more secure, more reliable, and more affordable than absentee voting. So let's get this done."", 'And I believe we should go even further to strengthen voting rights in America. So today I am calling for universal, automatic voter registration. Every citizen, every state in the Union. Everyone, every young man or young woman should be automatically registered to vote when they turn 18—unless they actively choose to opt out. But I believe this would have a profound impact on our elections and our democracy. Between a quarter and a third of all eligible Americans remain unregistered and therefore unable to vote.', ""And we should modernize our entire approach to registration. The current system is a relic from an earlier age. It relies on a blizzard of paper records and it's full of errors."", 'We can do better. We can make sure that registration rolls are secure, up to date, and complete. When you move, your registration should move with you. If you are an eligible vote and want to be registered, you should be a registered voter—period.', ""Now, Oregon is already leading the way modernizing its system, and the rest of the country should follow. The technology is there. States have a lot of the data already. It's just a matter of syncing and streamlining."", ""Now, all of these reforms, from expanded early voting to modernized registration, are common sense ways to strengthen our democracy. But I'll be candid here, none of them will come easily."", ""It's going to take leadership at many levels."", 'Now more than ever, we need our citizens to actually get out and vote for people who want to hear what is on their minds.', ""We need more activists working to expose abuses, educate Americans about their rights, and hold authorities accountable for protecting them. Some of the worst provisions in recent laws have been blocked or delayed by tireless advocates raising the alarm and filing legal challenges. But they can't do it alone."", 'We need more grassroots mobilization efforts like the Moral Monday movement in North Carolina to build momentum for reform.', ""We need more Justices on the Supreme Court who will protect every citizen's right to vote, I mean the principle underlying our Constitution, which we had to fight for a long time to make apply to everybody, one person, one vote and we need a Supreme Court that cares more about protecting the right to vote of a person than the right to buy and election of a corporation."", 'But of course, you know what we really need? We need more elected leaders from Houston to Austin to Washington who will follow in the footsteps of Barbara Jordan and fight for the rights and opportunities of everyday Americans, not just those at the top of the ladder. And we need to remember that progress is built on common ground, not scorched earth.', 'You know, when I traveled around the world as your Secretary of State, one of the most frequent questions I was asked was, ""How could you and President Obama work together after you fought so hard in that campaign?""', 'People were genuinely amazed, which I suppose is understandable, considering that in many places, when you lose an election or you oppose someone who wins you could get imprisoned or exiled—even killed—not hired as Secretary of State.', ""And it's true, I was surprised when the President asked me to serve. But he made that offer, and I accepted it, because we both love our country."", 'So my friends, here at this historic institution let us remember that America was built by people who knew that our common interest was more important than our self-interest. They were fearless in pursuit of a stronger, freer, and fairer nation.', 'As Barbara Jordan famously reminded us, when the Constitution was first written, it left most of us here out. But generations of Americans fought and marched and organized and prayed to expand the circle of freedom and opportunity. They never gave up and never backed down.', 'And nearly a century ago on this very day, after years of struggle, Congress finally passed the 19th amendment to give women the right to vote in the United States.', ""So that is, that is the story of progress, courageous men and women, expanding rights, not restricting them. And today we refuse, we refuse to allow our country or this generation of leaders to slow or reverse America's long march toward a more perfect union."", 'We owe it to our children and grandchildren to fight just as hard as those who came before us did. To march just as far. To organize just as well. To speak out just as loudly. And to vote, every chance we get for the kind of future we want.', ""That's what Barbara Jordan would do. That's what we should do in honor of her."", 'Thank you, and may God bless you.']"

Early childhood education is a great foundation, but I have a 14 year old, so what your plans for education in general? The state of education today is horrendous, especially for children with ADHD. You're looking at cookie-cutter classrooms, and these kids don't learn that way."", 'So what types of plans do you have for them?', 'CLINTON: Well, this is one of the—you know, the key issues about how we do more do adapt our school system to spark the ability to learn in every kind of kid, because kids learn differently.', ""You know, some kids can sit there and absorb the teacher's lessons. Some kids need to move. Some kids need to have practical experience. And I do think we have erred in trying to channel every kid into one form of learning. And I don't think that... [applause]"", ""I don't think that works for every kid. And especially for kids who are hyperactive, kids who, you know, need to be channeled and directed, but also need to be able to, you know, get rid of some of that extra energy that they've got."", ""I mean, I don't know how you—I don't know how you expect to eliminate everything from recess to gym to extracurricular activities during the school day and not have a lot of kids unable to concentrate and a lot of kids unable to really absorb the lessons you're trying to teach."", ""So, the specific issue about ADHD kids is we need to make sure we have the best possible diagnosis and treatment, because we are medicating lots of kids. And I think we have to ask ourselves: Are we medicating those kids because they have a medical condition that needs to be medicated? And the answer is yes, some do, no doubt about it. But are we medicating kids because we've not yet figured out how to better deal with their particular needs?"", ""And that starts in the family, because it, you know, it's hard for a lot of families, but it also goes into the schools."", ""So I—I—part of what I will be talking about in the campaign is how do we, you know, get our schools and doing so by respecting our teachers who are on the front lines of trying to... [applause] ... help kids. And, you know, trying to figure out what works for different kinds of kids. And I don't think a cookie-cutter approach works. I want every kid to do well in school. I want every kid to get the skills that that kid needs. I think we made an error when we eliminated in high school, in most high schools, technical education, what we used to call vocational education. [applause]"", ""I think, you know, there are—we're going to need a lot of jobs that are good jobs, by people who can do work that is not just academic work. It is work that, you know, they learn to do by doing. And then—I was, you know, I was in a community college, you knew, New Hampshire Technical Institute, talking to the people there. And the—there were students who were taking courses, who were in high school. That's one way of doing it, having kind of a group of high schools send their kids to a technical institute if they're interested."", 'I went to one in Iowa where young kids were learning how to be machinists. They were juniors and seniors in high school. And the ones who were seniors had jobs lined up, starting to pay, like, $40,000 because they were coming out as a certified machinist.', ""Well, we need to make that available for more kids. And, look, I'm not a scientist. [laughter]"", 'But unlike a lot of the candidates on the other side, I actually listen to scientists. [laughter]', ""And one of the things that... [laughter and applause] ... one of the things that I will try to do, with a—by partnering, you know, not by mandating and directing, but partnering with our educators, partnering with people who have experience like our folks here, is to figure out: OK, how do we get more hands-on learning? Because I do believe that for kids, especially ADHD kids, doing something, not trying to sit still, which is really hard, but getting up and learning, you know, going from machine to machine to figure out how it works, if that's their interest."", ""So we're going to take a hard look at all of that. But it's—you know, education is a local and state matter, but I think if we do a better job looking at all the research about what actually produces the best results, then we can come up with some incentive programs and some encouragement that will begin to try once again to get our education system to respond to the real needs that a whole variety of kids have."", 'QUESTION: Thank you. [applause]', 'MODERATOR: Can we get someone in the back? Women in the [inaudible]? Yes.', 'Here comes the mike.', ""QUESTION: Thank you. We spend so much money on the military and we are able to get the money just like this. But nationwide, our schools are not equal and they're not of the same standards. So, why are we not making a priority nationwide and per state on education as much as spending on other things? And the military is important, I do realize that."", 'OK. Thank you.', ""CLINTON: Well, you know, education has been principally a state responsibility and a local responsibility. And it really wasn't until, you know, 30, 40 years ago, really, I guess back in the 1960s, when the government began to put in a lot more money from the Federal Government into education."", 'And the original idea behind the Federal Government putting money in was to try to equalize spending, so that, you know, kids in poor districts would have a better chance to get the same resources and the same quality of teachers and all that, which I think is still very important, so that it was an equity argument—some of you know, Title 1, in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act—was really designed to do that.', 'Then in the Reagan Administration, I think it was 19—I want to remember here—\'83 or so. There was a report that came out called ""A Nation at Risk."" And it compared our educational outcomes with comparable countries, mostly Europeans, some Asian, and basically said, you know, our kids are not keeping up, they\'re not performing. And that was really a big change.', ""The Reagan administration began saying, OK, well, the Federal Government has to do more to try to change the way we're educating. And that went on. And certainly, President George W. Bush with No Child Left Behind, it was certainly well-motivated. I was in the Senate. I know the arguments that were made. And it was to try to, you know, create a system where, no matter who you were, where you went to school, you'd have the same expectations about how you were going to achieve."", ""And I say all of this because we've always spent money on our military, you know, depending upon who's in and who's out, greater or lesser amounts. But always the biggest part of the budget, other than Social Security, Medicare, et cetera."", 'So I think that your question is a fair one, like, what are our priorities? We will always have to have the—you know, the strongest, best-equipped military. But even there we have to save money. We have to be smart about it. We have to look for ways to get more done efficiently.', ""And just like every other part of government, it needs to be looked at hard, so that we don't just send money, without getting the results that we need. And there are a lot of issues in procurement and in other areas around—you know, military equipment and expenditures that really need to be cleaned up, streamlined and made less expensive without sacrificing quality."", ""So I think that it's time in our country—and in my speech on Saturday, I said we have to [inaudible] our government. We have to take a hard look at everything. We have to bring it into the 21st century. Now our military equipment is 22nd century. I mean, it's more advanced than anybody, anywhere."", ""But we're also fighting wars where a lot of what we've paid a lot of money for is no longer applicable. I mean, we're dealing with different kinds of threats. We're dealing with cyber threats. We're dealing with, you know, irregular warfare and terrorism. So we've got to adjust how we fund even defense, but we have to always fund it. to the extend that we need to get the outcomes we're looking for."", ""But on education, we've put more federal dollars in. But to go back to the question about ADHD, we need to take a hard look about what's working and what's not working. I just want to give you a—and I'm going to roll out a whole education proposal, too. But I want to give you a quick understanding of what I mean."", ""You know, everybody believes, and I'm guilty of this, that we're an expert about education, because we went to school. [laughter]"", ""And those of us who are parents, we had kids in school, so we think we got it all figured out. We know what worked or didn't work for us and, therefore, we kind of translate that into what will or won't work for other people."", ""Look, there's a lot of truth to that. People's—your experience matters. And how you experienced school matters."", ""But I think research really counts. So, there's a team of researchers I know—you know, they're based at Harvard, but other schools have been involved. And they went through all of the work that's been done. They said, OK, what makes for a great school?"", 'And they came out with some things that are simple, but hard to do and hard to pay for, you know, things like a longer school year, particularly for disadvantaged kids. We have so much research, it matters, because, you know, for many of this in room, summertime, you give your kids new experiences. Maybe they go to the Y camp. I was talking to, you know, one of he people where who runs the camps. Maybe they—maybe you take them on trips, where they go to museums.', 'But for a lot of kids, they actually lose learning over the summer. So here the teachers have worked and worked, and parents have reinforced the messages in many instances, then they lose ground, so they start the school year a little behind in some areas than where they ended the school year.', 'So a longer school year for a lot of kids makes a lot of sense. A longer school day for a lot of kids makes a lot of sense, because if you have kids particularly in the pre-teen, early-teen years, and they get out of school before parents get home from work, that is one of the worst times of the day for kids to get themselves in trouble. And all kinds of trouble and bad influences.', 'Well, you know, the parents are working. Oftentimes, again, they have no options, so longer day, longer school day.', ""More support for preparing for teachers so that they can share what works with each other. Now, that sounds so simple, but it is so critical. Like, OK, what worked in your classroom? You know, I tried this lesson, it didn't work, let's take another look at it."", ""And what we've done instead is to disempower experienced teachers and instead basically try to lay on top of them all of these tests and all of these standards."", ""I believe in both, always have, but you can get to a point of diminishing returns. Too many and really all you're doing is like running on the hamster wheel, instead of figuring out what does this kid need? What's the diagnosis for this kid's problem? How do we deal with it? And then finally let's not forget the role that parents play and families play in helping a kid succeed in school. So having more interaction between the school and the home, even if it's a phone call, even if it's an e-mail exchange, even better if it's regular visits. Because if parents don't understand what their kids are supposed to be learning and they don't reinforce it, it's really hard for teachers to make that case."", ""So I think that we can do a better job in using the money we spend on education more effectively and trying to figure out where at state and local levels more expenditures would make a difference. And I'm very open to that because it breaks my heart that in a lot of poor districts right now, those poor schools have lost every extracurricular activity. They don't have sports teams anymore. They don't have bands. They don't have plays. They don't have a lot of the things that you remember from school and that for many kids gave them their first taste of success."", 'And so, when you cut out all of those programs and you just say, ""You\'ve got to do well on these tests"" that are taught in a certain way, to be learned in a certain way, a lot of kids are not gonna be able to grasp that and do well. But if you give them more options, more responsibility and more support for those places that need it, then, I think, we can get better outcomes personally as well as academically.', ""So that's what I want to see us do more of, so. [applause]"", 'QUESTION: Thank you.', 'MODERATOR: Thank you.', 'We have time for one more question. Lady in the back in the polka dot?', 'QUESTION: Thank you for mentioning that you listen to scientists, because I happen to be one of them. [laughter]', 'CLINTON: Excellent.

We don't know what they are going to be, and the central skill that we need to teach them and enable is creativity."", ""However, we seem to also do one more thing is compare ourselves to places like China. And our education is turning into worksheet-based education. Only we are drilling kids and art is disappearing, music is disappearing, even in [inaudible] rich schools where I live in Portsmouth. Art is once a week. Music is once a week. That's it."", ""And it's all about tests and it's all about [inaudible] even in kindergarten. I have heard stories from kindergartners who come home crying after tests in kindergarten."", 'So, can we try to compare ourselves also to places like Finland that do not start formal education until age seven? [applause]', 'They let them play. [applause]', ""CLINTON: Well, you make a great point. If people are really interested in following up on the points that she made, we don't compare ourselves to China, but it is stressing to me when China invests in preschool opportunities for kids and we don't. Because if you look at the highest-performing nations, Finland is usually at the top."", ""They have early childhood education. They have paid leave. They have support for families. And yes, they don't start school until kids are seven, but those kids have not just been wandering around fending for themselves. They've been in organized settings, predominantly family-based, but not exclusively."", ""And if you look at the other countries—the best comparisons are to what are called the OECD countries, if you're interested in googling that and looking. They do a very thorough educational survey every few years and they lay out what's working and what's not working."", ""And I absolutely agree that, you know, creativity, you cannot expect kids to be creative if you don't let them play. Now, playing is a learning experience and in preschool it should be, in kindergarten it should be. [applause]"", ""That doesn't mean they can't be learning at the same time. And that—and this debate that we're having seems to me to be so beside the point. It's not like either play or learn. Through play that is supervised in preschool, you will learn if it's done right. That's why we want quality preschool. Right? And so it's a way of unleashing creativity and allowing, you know, little kids' personalities to develop."", ""I just—in the classroom where I just was, I was handed this book of drawings.

14,            Hillary Clinton          ,"July 26, 2015","[""I also want to thank Jan [Bauer] for reminding us that today is the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. And I am thrilled to see the progress – she talked about some of the barriers that she faced when she came here to go to college, and how a lot of those barriers have been broken down and eliminated. What she didn't say is that in addition to the leadership Tom Harkin showed in getting the ADA passed, Jan was a strong voice in favor of that as well and an incredible witness for what it would mean."", 'I think that we should acknowledge how the disabilities community has played such an important role in changing things for the better in our country. I remember my first job out of law school was with the Children\'s Defense Fund. I didn\'t want to go work for a law firm. I wanted to go to work to be an advocate, and I joined the organization started by Marian Wright Edelman, an incredible woman lawyer, African-American, first ever to pass – and be acknowledged as passing – the Mississippi state bar, and Marian started the Children\'s Defense Fund. When I joined, our first project in the summer of 1973 was to go door to door along with others across our country to gather evidence about why so many American children were not in school. We suspected that one of the biggest reasons was that their disabilities were not accommodated in school, and therefore they could not attend school. But we didn\'t know that for sure, and we wanted to find out. So I went door-to-door in New Bedford, Massachusetts, saying, ""Do you have a school-aged child who\'s not in school?"" And I heard, yes, you know, our daughter dropped out to take care of the younger kids, or our son dropped out to go to work to help support the family. But I heard mostly that, yes, we have a blind child, a deaf child, a child in a wheelchair, a child with some other kind of disability that is not accepted in school. So we gathered up all of our evidence, and we presented it to the Congress, and that first effort resulted in passing Education for All, and all children with disabilities were given the right to go to school. That was a huge step forward for our country.', 'And then the effort began with real conviction to try to expand the rights that people with disabilities should have in our society. Tom Harkin, Ted Kennedy, Tony Coelho, and then the bill was finally passed and signed by George H.W. Bush. It was a great success in showing that bipartisanship – bringing people together to solve a problem that affected millions of our fellow citizens – could actually work.', ""We've come a long way in the last 25 years. We still have work to do. We're by no means finished. And when I was Secretary of State, President Obama and I wanted to get passed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. We held an event at the White House. We lined up sponsors, both in the Congress and outside, because it required the Congress – the Senate – to pass. And then we worked really hard, and the Republicans would not support it in the numbers needed. They wouldn't even listen to the pleas of their former leader, Senator Robert Dole, who as you know lost the use of an arm when he was in the military in World War II."", ""So there's a lot of unfinished business – both at home, and around the world. But I personally believe that the progress and the landmark legislation – first on education then broadly opening up transportation and buildings and employment, everything that people should be able to pursue – that that legislation was one of the real highlights of the civil rights and human rights movements in America."", ""We have our faults and we have our challenges, but there isn't any nation that has continually tried to push forward to widen the circle of opportunity the way we have. Despite the continuing problems that we face, we're going to keep doing that."", ""So I want to applaud you, Jan, and others who have been at the forefront of this movement. I want to introduce the Todds – Dale, Sara and Adam – who are here. I've turned over my twitter account to Sara to be tweeting about the challenges they face as a family with a young man who's got some challenges himself because I think we all have to recognize that as much progress as we've made, we still have work to do. So I want to thank you for being leaders and advocates on behalf of the community.""]"

It's great to be back at Brookings and there are a lot of long-time friends and colleagues who perch here at Brookings. Obviously, including Strobe and Martin, who I'll speak to in a minute. Also Bob Einhorn and Tammy Wittes."", ""This institution has hosted many important conversation over the years and I appreciate Strobe's reference to the event last night and the continuing dialogue about urgent issues facing our nation and the world. That's what brings me here today, back to Brookings, to talk about the question we're all grappling with: how to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and more broadly, how to protect ourselves and our allies from the full range of threats that Iran poses."", 'The stakes are high and there are no simple of perfectly satisfying solutions. So these questions, and in particular the merits of the nuclear deal recently reached with Iran, have divided people of good will and raised hard issues on both sides.', ""Here is how I see it. Either we move forward on the path of diplomacy and seize this chance to block Iran's path to a nuclear weapon or, we turn down a more dangerous path, leading to a far-less certain and riskier future. That's why I support this deal. I support it as part of a larger strategy toward Iran."", ""By now, the outcome in Congress is no longer in much doubt. So we've got to start looking made to what comes next, enforcing the deal, deterring Iran and its proxies and strengthening our allies. These will be my goals as president and today I want to talk about how I would achieve them."", ""Let me start by saying I understand the skepticism so many feel about Iran. I too am deeply concerned about Iranian aggression and the need to confront it. It's a ruthless, brutal regime that has the blood of Americans, many others and including its own people on its hands."", 'Its political rallies resound with cries of, ""Death to America."" Its leaders talk about wiping Israel off the face of the map, most recently just yesterday, and foment terror against it. There is absolutely no reason to trust Iran.', 'Now, Vice President Cheney may hope that the American people will simply forget, but the truth is, by the time President Obama took office and I became secretary of State, Iran was racing toward a nuclear capability.', ""They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle, meaning that they had the material, scientists and technical know how to create material for nuclear weapons. They had produced and installed thousands of centrifuges, expanded their secret facilities, established a robust uranium enrichment program and defied their international obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. And they haven't suffered many consequences."", ""I voted for sanctions again and again as a senator from New York. But they weren't having much effect. Most of the world still did business with Iran. We needed to step up our game."", 'So President Obama and I pursued a two-prong strategy: pressure and engagement. We made it clear that the door to diplomacy was open if Iran answered the concerns of the international community in a serious and credible way.', 'We simultaneously launched a comprehensive campaign to significantly raise the cost of Iranian defiance. We systematically increased our military capabilities in the region, deepening our cooperation with partners and sending more fire power, an additional aircraft carrier, battleship, strike aircraft and the most advanced radar and missile defense systems available.', 'Meanwhile, I traveled the world capital by capital, leader by leader, twisting arms to help build the global coalition that produced some of the most effective sanctions in history.', ""With President Obama's leadership, we worked with Congress and the European Union to cut Iran off from the world's economic and financial system. And one by one, we persuaded energy-hungry consumers of Iranian oil, like India and South Korea, to cut back."", ""Soon, Iran's tankers sat rusting in port. Its economy was collapsing."", ""These new measures were effective because we made them global. American sanctions provided the foundation, but Iran didn't really feel the heat until we turned this into an international campaign so biting that Iran had no choice but to negotiate. They could no longer play off one country against another; they had no place to hide."", 'So they started looking for a way out. I first visited Oman to speak with the sultan of Oman in January of 2011, went back later that year. The sultan helped set up a secret back channel. I sent one of my closest aids as part of a small team to begin talks with the Iranians in secret.', 'Negotiations began in earnest after the Iranian election in 2013. First, the bilateral talks led by Deputy Secretary Bill Burns and Jake Sullivan that led to the interim agreement, then the multilateral talks led by Secretary John Kerry, Secretary Ernie Moniz and Undersecretary Wendy Sherman.', ""Now there's a comprehensive agreement on Iran's nuclear program. Is it perfect? Well, of course not. No agreement like this ever is."", 'But is a strong agreement? Yes, it is. And we absolutely should not turn it down.', ""The merits of the deal have been well-argued, so I won't go through them in great detail here. The bottom line is that it accomplishes the major goals we set out to achieve. It blocks every pathway for Iran to get a bomb, and it gives us better tools for verification and inspection and to compel rigorous compliance.\xa0 Without a deal, Iran's breakout time, how long they need to produce enough material for a nuclear weapon, would shrink to a couple of months. With a deal, that breakout time stretches to a year, which means that if Iran cheats, we'll know it, and we'll have time to respond decisively."", ""Without a deal, we would have no credible inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. With a deal, we'll have unprecedented access; we'll be able to monitor every aspect of their nuclear program."", ""Now, some have expressed concern that certain nuclear restrictions expire after 15 years. And we need to be vigilant about that, which I'll talk more about in a moment. But other parts are permanent, including Iran's obligations under the Non-proliferation Treaty and their commitment to enhanced inspections under the additional protocol."", ""Others have expressed concern that it could take up to 24 days to gain access to some of Iran's facilities when we suspect cheating. I'd be the first to say that this part of the deal is not perfect. Although the deal does allow for daily access to enrichment facilities and monitoring of the entire nuclear fuel cycle."", ""It's important to focus on that, because being able to monitor the supply chain is critical to what we will find out and how we will be able to respond. But our experts tell us that even with delayed access to some places, this deal does the job. Microscopic nuclear particles remain for years and years. They are impossible to hide. That's why Secretary Moniz, a nuclear physicist, has confidence in this plan."", 'And some are suggested we just go back to the negotiating table and get a better, unspecified deal. I can certainly understand why that may sound appealing, but as someone who started these talks in the first place, and built our global coalition piece by piece, I can assure you it is not realistic. Plus, if we walk away now, our capacity to sustain and enforce sanctions will be severely diminished.', 'We will be blamed, not the Iranians.', ""So if we were to reject this agreement, Iran would be poised to get nearly everything it wants without giving up a thing. No restrictions on their nuclear program. No real warning if Tehran suddenly rushes toward a bomb. And the International Sanctions regime would fall apart, so no more economic consequences for Iran, either. Those of use who have been out there on the diplomatic front lines know that diplomacy is not the pursuit of perfection; it's the balancing of risk."", ""And on balance, the far riskier course right now would be to walk away. Great powers can't just junk agreements and expect the rest of the world to go along with us. We need to be reasonable and consistent, and keep our word, especially when we are trying to lead a coalition."", 'That is how we will make this and future deals work. But it is not enough to say, ""yes,"" to the deal. Of course it isn\'t.We have to say, yes, and—yes, and we will enforce it with vigor and vigilance. Yes, and we will embed it in a broader strategy to confront Iran\'s bad behavior in the region. Yes, and we will begin from day one to set the conditions, so Iran knows it will never get a nuclear weapon, not during the term of the agreement, not after, not ever. We need to be clear. And I think we have to make that very clear to Iran about what we expect from them. This is not the start of some larger diplomatic opening and we shouldn\'t accept that this deal will lead to broader changes in their behavior.', ""That shouldn't be a promise for proceeding, instead we need to be prepared for three scenarios. First, Iran tries to cheat, something it's been quite willing to do in the past. Second, Iran tries to wait us out, perhaps it waits to move for 15 years when some, but not all restrictions expire. And third, Iran ramps up the dangerous behavior in the region, including its support for terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah."", 'I believe the success of this deal has a lot to do with how the next president grapples with these challenges. So let me tell you what I would do. My starting point will be one of distrust.', ""You remember President Reagan's line about the Soviets: Trust but verify? My approach will be distrust and verify. We should anticipate that Iran will test the next president, they'll want to see how far they can bend the rules. That won't work if I'm in the white house."", 'I will hold the line against Iranian noncompliance, that means penalties even for small violations, keeping our allies on board, but being willing to snapback sanctions into place unilaterally if we have to, working with congress to close any gaps in the sanctions. Right now members of congress are offering proposals to that affect and I think the current administration should work with them to see whether there are additional steps that could be taken.', ""Finally it means insuring that the IAEA has the resources it needs from finances to personnel to equipment to hold Iran's feet to the fire. The most important thing we can do to keep Iran from cheating or trying to wait us out is to shaped Iranian expectations right from the start. The Iranians and the world need to understand that we will act decisively if we need to."", ""So here is my message to Iran's leaders, The United States will never allow you to acquire a nuclear weapon. As president, I will take whatever action is necessary to protect the united states and our allies, I will not hesitate to take military action if Iran attempts to obtain a nuclear weapon, and I will set up my successor to be able to credibly make the same pledge. We will make clear to Iran that our commitment to prevention will not waver depending on who is in office, it's permanent."", 'Should it become necessary in the future having exhausted peaceful alternatives to turn to military force, we will have preserved and in some cases enhanced our capacity to act. And because we have proven our commitment to diplomacy first, the world will more likely join us.', ""Then there is the broader issue of countering Iran's bad behavior across the region. Taking nuclear-weapons out of the equation is crucial because an Iran with nuclear weapons is so much more dangerous, than an Iran without them."", ""But even without nuclear weapons, we still see Iran's fingerprints on nearly every conflict across the Middle East. They support bad actors from Syria, to Lebanon, to Yemen. They vow to destroy Israel. And that's worth saying again. They vow to destroy Israel. We can not ever take that lightly, particularly when Iran ships and advanced missiles to Hezbollah and the ayatollah outlines an actual strategy for eliminating Israel, or talks about how Israel won't exist in 25 years just like he did today."", 'And in addition to the malicious activity they already underwrite, we have got to anticipate that Iran could use some of the economic relief they get from this deal to pay for even more. So as President I will raise the costs for their actions and confront them across the board. My strategy will be based on five strong pillars.', ""First, I will deepen America's unshakeable commitment to Israel's security, including our long standing tradition of guaranteeing Israel's qualitative military edge. I'll increase support for Israeli rocket and missile defenses and for intelligence sharing. I'll sell Israel the most sophisticated fire aircraft ever developed. The F-35. We'll work together to develop and implement better tunnel detection technology to prevent arms smuggling and kidnapping as well as the strongest possible missile defense system for Northern Israel, which has been subjected to Hezbollah's attacks for years."", ""Second, I will reaffirm that the Persian Gulf is a region of vital interest to the United States. We do not want any of Iran's neighbors to develop or acquire a nuclear weapon's program either. So we want them to feel and be secure. I will sustain a robust military presence in the region, especially our air and naval forces. We'll keep the Strait of Hormuz open. We'll increase security cooperation with our Gulf allies, including intelligence sharing, military support and missile defense to ensure they can defend against Iranian aggression. Even if that takes the form of cyberattacks or other non-traditional threats."", ""Iran should understand that the United States and I as President, will not stand by as our Gulf allies and partners are threatened. We will act. Third, I will be a coalition to counter Iran's proxies, particularly Hezbollah. That means enforcing and strengthening the rules prohibiting the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah. Looking at new ways to choke off their funding and pressing our partners to treat Hezbollah as the terrorist organization that it is."", ""It's time to eliminate the false distinction that some still make between the supposed political and military wings. If you're part of Hezbollah, you're part of a terrorist organization, plain and simple. Beyond Hezbollah, I'll crack down on the shipment of weapons to Hamas. And push Turkey and Qatar to end their financial support. I'll press our partners in the region to prevent aircrafts and ships owned by companies linked to Iran's revolutionary guard from entering their territories, and urge our partners to block Iranian plans from entering their airspace on their way to Yemen and Syria."", ""Across the board, I will vigorously enforce and strengthen, if necessary, other American sanctions on Iran and its revolutionary guard for its sponsorship of terrorism, its ballistic missile program and other destabilizing activities.\xa0 I'll enforce and strengthen, if necessary, our restrictions on sending arms to Iran and from Iran to bad actors like Syria, and I'll impose these sanctions on everyone involved in these activities, whether they're in Iran or overseas. This will be a special imperative, as some of the U.N. sanctions lapse, so the U.S. and our partners have to step up."", ""Fourth, I'll stand, as I always have, against Iran's abuses at home, from its detention of political prisoners, to its crack down on freedom of expression, including online. Its inhumane policies hold back talented and spirited people. Our quarrel is not and never has been that the Iranian people. They'd have a bright future, hopeful future if they weren't held back by their leaders."", ""As I've said before, I think we were too restrained in our support of the protests in June 2009 and in our condemnation of the government crack down that followed. That won't happen again. We will enforce, and if need be, broaden our human rights sanction and I will not rest until every single American detained or missing in Iran is home."", 'Fifth, just to the nuclear agreement needs to be embedded in a broader Iran policy. Our broader Iran policy needs to be embedded in a comprehensive regional strategy that promotes stability and counters extremism.', ""Iran, like ISIS, benefits from chaos and strife. It exploits other countries' weaknesses and the best defense against Iran are the countries and governments being strong, that they can provide security and economic opportunity to their own people and they must have the tools to push back on radicalization and extremism."", ""Helping countries get there will take time and strategic discipline, but it's crucial that the United States leads this effort. I will push for renewed diplomacy to solve the destructive regional conflicts that Iran fuels. We have to bring sufficient pressure on Assad to force a political solution in Syria, including a meaningful increase in our efforts to train and equip the moderate Syrian opposition, something I called for early in the conflict, and the United States must lead in assisting those who have been uprooted by conflict, especially the millions of Syrian refugees now beseeching the world to help them."", ""As Pope Francis reminded us, this is an international problem that demands an international response, and the United States must help lead that response. That's who we are, and that's what we do."", ""So our strategy needs to cover all these bases, Iran's nuclear ambitions and its support of terrorism, its hatred of Israel and its cruelty towards its citizens, its military resources and its economic strengths and weaknesses. We need to be creative, committed and vigilant, and on every front, we need to keep working closely with our friends and partners."", ""On that note, let me just spend a minute speaking about the serious concerns that Israel's leaders have about this deal. Israel has every reason to be alarmed by a regime that both denies its existence and seeks its destruction.\xa0 I would not support this agreement for one second if I thought it put Israel in greater danger. I believe in my core that Israel and America must stand side by side, and I—I will always stand by Israel's right to defend itself, as I always have.\xa0 I believe this deal and a joint strategy for enforcing it makes Israel safer."", ""I say that with humility. I'm not Israeli. I don't know what it's like to live under constant threat from your neighbors in a country where the margin for error is so thin. I know that my saying this deal makes you safer won't alleviate the very real fears of the Israeli people."", ""But I have stood for Israeli security for a very long time. It was one of my bedrock principles as secretary of state. It's why I supported stronger defense systems, like the Iron Dome anti-rocket defense system, which proved so effective in protecting Israeli lives during the conflicts of 2012 and last summer, that's why I've worked closely with Israel to advance the two-state vision of a Jewish and Democratic Israel with secure and recognized borders, and it's why I believe we should expedite negotiations of a long-term military assistance agreement with Israel."", ""Let's not wait until 2017 when the current deal expires; let's get it done this year."", 'I would invite the Israeli prime minister to the White House during my first month in office to talk about all of these issues and to set us on a course of close, frequent consultation right from the start, because we both rely on each other for support as partners, allies and friends.', ""This isn't just about policy for me; it is personal. As president, I'm committed to shoring up and strengthening the relationship between our countries."", 'We have had honest disagreements about this deal. Now is the time to come together. Now is the time to remember what unites us and build upon it.', ""And so I know well that the same forces that threaten Israel threaten the United States. And to the people of Israel, let me say, you'll never have to question whether we're with you. The United States will always be with you. There have also been honest disagreements about the nuclear deal here at home. Smart, serious people can see issues like these differently, like my friend, Chuck Schumer, who's going to be an excellent leader in the Senate. I respect the skepticism that he and others feel, and I respect differences of opinion and people who advocate vigorously for their beliefs."", 'But I have a harder time respecting those who approach an issue as serious as this with unserious talk, especially anyone running to be president of the United States.', ""Several Republican candidates boast they'll tear up this agreement in 2017, more than a year after it's been implemented. That's not leadership; that's recklessness. It would set us right down the very dangerous path we have worked so hard to avoid."", ""I'm looking forward to a—a robust debate about foreign policy in this campaign. Where we have disagreements, we should lay them out, like if American ground forces in Iraq should engage in direct combat, as Scott Walker wants, or if we should keep Cuba closed, as Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush want. Let's debate these issues.\xa0 But let's debate them on the basis of facts, not fear. Let's resist denigrating the patriotism or loyalty of those who disagree with us, and let's avoid at all costs undermining America's credibility abroad. That only makes us weaker, and I am going to call it out whenever I see it."", 'I spent four years representing America abroad as America—secretary of state was one of the greatest privileges of my life, and knowing my fellow Americans were counting on the and rooting for me, not as Democrats, not as Republicans, but as Americans, meant to great deal.', ""We are all one team, the American team and that doesn't change, no matter how much we may disagree. I can tell you from personal experience we are stronger overseas, when we are united at home. So we simply have to find a way to work together better than we have been doing. There is a lot Democrats and Republicans can and should agree on."", 'The United States should lead in the Middle East, we can agree on that. We should stand by our friends against Iranian aggression, we can agree on that, too. I believe the plan I have laid out today is one that all Americans could endorse, and I hope they will.', ""The next president will face threats from many quarters, from those we see today like terrorism from ISIS, aggressiveness from Putin, pandemics like Ebola, to all those we can't predict yet."", ""We need a leader who has a strong vision for the future, and the skill and determination to get us there. We can't stop the world from changing, but we can help to shape those changes, and we can do that by beating with strength, smarts and unyielding commitment to our values. You know, I saw that when I was first lady, senator, secretary of state, that when America leads with principal and purpose, other people and governments are eager to join us."", ""No country comes close to matching our advantages, the strength of our economy, the skill of our work force, tradition of innovation, our unmatched network of alliances and partnership. So, we are poised to remain that world's most admired and powerful nation for of long time, if we make this smart choices and practice smart leadership. That is what I will try to do as your president, and I believe as strongly as ever that our best days are ahead of us, and that America's greatest contributions to the world are yet to come."", 'Thank you all very much. [applause]', 'INDYK: Well, thank you, very much, Madam Secretary.', 'I was wondering what we could call this speech, and it occurred to me at the end it would be, ""From Hard Choices to Smart Choices."" Right? Or the ""Yes, And"" speech.', ""Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this second part of the event with Secretary Clinton, which is little a conversation that I will have with her, and then we'll take questions from the audience."", ""I wanted to start by saying, number one, it's a very clear and very strong speech. And if I had to summarize the basic elements of it, the message to Iran is, we will enforce, we will confront you when you try to destabilize the region, and we will deter you if you try to go for a nuclear weapon some time down the line.\xa0 And I wonder how you navigate what is a certain, unspoken tension between the fact that you're going to be taking a hard line against some of the—some of the destabilizing and nefarious activities of the Iranians, and at the same time, this agreement puts the United States into a partnership with Iran in terms of implementing it."", 'So how do you deal with that—that tension, the Iranians may feel, ""Hey, we\'re giving up all these things to do with our nuclear program and this is what we\'re going to get in return,"" is—is very tough American response?', ""CLINTON: Well, I don't see Iran as our partner in implementing the agreement. I believe that Iran is the subject of the agreement, that it now faces obligations that frankly, in many instances, it faced before the agreement and that they have a—signed an agreement where they are committing themselves to fulfill the terms of the agreement."", 'The agreement will be enforced not by Iran, the agreement will be enforced by the rest of the negotiators, the other countries plus the IAEA, and it will be and is intended to be quite burdensome and intrusive into Iran.', ""Now, maybe they believe that having signed the agreement, they can somehow avoid the consequences of the inspections and the other requirements, but I think they understand very well they're at the starting line, there are these demands that they are supposed to fulfill, there is a sequencing of you know, lifting of sanctions and other kinds of benefits that they receive in return for they're having taken the action required."", 'And I think they are, if anything, probably counting on the world led by the United States being distracted, being diverted, getting tired, not having the staying power to consistently enforce the agreement and hold Iran accountable, and I for one, want to make clear to them that that is not going to happen, that we will take seriously every aspect of this agreement and we will expect them to comply and there will be consequences if they do not.', 'INDYK: When you called for a—a regional strategy and outlined the—the elements of that, it really seems to come down to when you say this in the speech, Syria and what happens in Syria where Iran is very invested in the Assad regime. Does a regional strategy on your watch mean taking down the Assad regime?', ""CLINTON: Well, you know, Martin, it's not only Iran that is invested, we're—obviously it's now becoming public, we are learning much more about Russian investment, Russian troops on the ground. It may very well be opening the door to greater Russian involvement. There is no doubt that Russian has—Russia has been a principal funder and supplier throughout this entire terrible episode."", 'So we are facing the collapse of Syria, the survival thus far of the Assad regime, although it clearly has much less to govern than it did when this started, the open ungoverned areas that are hosting terrorist groups and the continuing commitment from Iran and Russia to propping up Assad.', ""So I—you know, I was the principal negotiator on the Geneva 2012 agreement, which Russia signed onto, which laid out a pathway to a political solution. It wasn't very long until Russia reneged on what they had signed. But I think it still provides a very credible framework threat from the terrorist groups and that the chaos in Syria can destabilize the region in ways that are bad for Iran. And therefore the higher the pressure is for some kind of reaction to what is going on inside Syria, and certainly the efforts that ISIS is making to take even more and hold territory in Iraq directly against what Iran sees as its interest, the continuing destabilization along the Lebanese border, there's all kinds of reasons why Iran is going to have to confront this instability."", 'So I think we—my view on this is we have to be talking, and pushing on, and raising the cost for Iran and for Russia all the time. Now, if Putin were sitting here—which is hard to imagine, but if he were—I should ask Strobe—Strobe is the expert. He would say, ""We\'re fighting terrorism, that\'s what we are doing. There may be a way to begin to join those efforts.""', 'INDYK: So—the—I remember well a speech that you gave when you were secretary of state, in which you warned the Gulf leaders about policies that were based on sand. President Obama in talking about the concerns of Iran\'s destabilizing activity in the region said, ""Look, we can help protect our Gulf Arab allies from external threats. the problem is how to protect them from internal threats."" And you have been clear again that you will do that in terms of protecting against those threats, but I wanted—I wonder how you deal with that continuing challenge?', ""CLINTON: Well, you know very well it is a difficult one. I apologize for my voice I'm suffering under massive allergy assault. Yes, Republican histamines are everywhere. [laughter]"", 'So—you know, Martin, this is one of the biggest problems we face, nobody can deny that much of the extremism in the world today is the direct result of policies and funding undertaken by the Saudi government and individuals. We would be foolish not to recognize that, I think increasingly they would be mistaken not to recognize that.', ""You can never be more extreme than the next extremist and I think they face some very serious internal problems, as do the other regimes. I am not sure they are convinced of that. I am not sure they believe that they have to figure out different ways of dealing with their own population and cooperating with each other, and cutting off funding, and exporting troublesome imams to elsewhere. But I think you have to be constantly beating that drum with them, and maybe now, given the rise of ISIS and the very clear threat they feel from, you know, Iranian activities in the Gulf that maybe there's an openness there. I know that the king was here last week, had a chance to, you know, meet with the president."", ""So perhaps there's more of an opportunity for a candid dialogue than we've had in the past. However, having said that, I still think we have to do what we need to do to defend them because the alternatives are hardly more promising."", 'INDYK: Israel. You—you\'ve made a very clear effort in your speech to say that, ""It\'s time for healing, it\'s time to come together."" And when you\'re President that you would have the Prime Minister there in your first month. And that\'s very consistent I think as you said in your speech with your approach which has always been as I know, to put your arm around Prime Minister Netanyahu or rather...', 'CLINTON: Or any Prime Minister.', 'INDYK: Thank you from the Gurney Press. [laughter]', 'And—and, as you know that\'s a policy I support too. But some of my friends in Israel recently have said, ""That\'s not the way to deal with us, we need tough love."" Which is the alternative you know? Instead of rewarding bad behavior which you should be really speaking tough—more toughly to us. Well, how do you respond to that?', ""CLINTON: Well I think there's a lot of room for tough love, particularly in private and behind you know, closed doors. As I write in my book, you know, certainly Prime Minister Netanyahu and I have had very rigorous conversations that have gone on in person and over the phone."", ""But I—I just don't think it's a particularly productive approach for the United States to take because in large measure, it opens the door to everybody else to delegitimize Israel to, you know, pile on in ways that are not good for the—the strength and stability, not just of Israel obviously but of the region. And so, in the absence of you know, some kind of greater goal that we were trying to achieve by doing that I just don't think that is the smartest approach."", ""INDYK: All right. Let's go to your questions. I would ask you please to identify yourself and make sure that there's a question mark at the—at the end of your question."", 'Robin Wright ?', 'CLINTON: Hi, Robin.', 'QUESTION: Thank you. Robin Wright , U.S. Institute of Peace and former Brookings scholar.', ""Madam Secretary, you talked about how you would use American muscle to contain Iran. Can you tell us how you might use the new diplomatic channel to engage Iran on issues whether it's support for extremist groups or specifically dealing with the crisis in Syria. Would you be willing to use that diplomatic channel to engage Iran?"", ""CLINTON: Yes, I would, Robin. And I—and I would because I think that we have to attempt to do that, you know?\xa0 When I first went to Oman in January of 2011, we didn't know whether any effort at some kind of secret channel would pay off. We still had the P5-plus-1 that was going on and we knew that eventually whatever the United States did would have to merge into the international approach."", ""But we had to begin to explore it. And we did. And we explored it over that summer. That's when we had the first, you know, visit to discuss anything could be possible. It takes awhile, as you know so well, being such an expert in this region, to figure out who's at the table, what the conversation's about, how seriously it will be taken, who's backing you up. And so, then when the—the talks actually started, just in the Iranian-American channel with Bill Burns and Jake Sullivan and Bob Einhorn was also involved."", 'It was—it was exploratory and it laid down some of the—the ground rules that we were looking for, and then eventually it was merged into the larger P5-plus-1 once there was a change in government in Iran and there was some real seriousness of effort.', ""So with respect to the other issues, I—I—I have very clearly, in the public arena, seen the Iranians at the highest levels reject any such discussion. They don't want to talk about Yemen, they don't want to talk about anything other than the nuclear agreement. Now that was a strategic decision we made back then."", ""You know, number one, it appeared to us in the early discussions with them, trying to figure out how to proceed. They wanted to talk about everything as a way to get some items on the table to trade off for the nuclear agreement, so that they would not have to make, perhaps, as many concessions as we were expecting them to make. That's why we kept very focused on just the nuclear program."", ""We also had the continuing challenge, and it would be even in this instance, of our friends in the Gulf not wanting us to talk about anything that affected them in a bilateral channel with the Iranians, and you can understand why. I mean, they—you know, if they weren't going to be at the table, they didn't want the United States talking about Yemen or talking about anything else of interest, of vital interest in their views to them."", ""So if there were a way to construct such a—a channel, I would be open to it, but I'm just laying out some of the difficulties of us being able to do that on this suite of other issues that are complex that touch many of the—the region's vital interests. And—and I think when it comes to Syria, we have historically not wanted to talk to Iran about Syria because we knew Iran was basically the principal supporter, propper up if you will, of Assad and we wanted to get the rest of the international community in harness to have a set of expectations and demands before we brought Iran in."", ""So we have to—you know, we have to readjust this all the time. Just as I said, diplomacy is the balancing of risk, it's also the—the constant evaluation of where the opportunities are, where the openings are, what possibly could happen now that didn't happen before. So I'm open but I am very sober about how it would have to be constructed and what it would actually cover and who would have to be either at the table or you know, in the—in the first chair behind, so that they didn't feel that they were being left out or negotiated over."", 'QUESTION: [inaudible]', 'CLINTON: Here comes your microphone.', 'QUESTION: Thanks for the microphone.', 'QUESTION: [off-mike]', ""CLINTON: So I think that's a very—it's an important questions. I don't know if you could hear the question. But it was—it was aimed at, what could you do to up the cost on Russia, for example, to be a more productive partner in seeking a solution? And how would we do more to—as I understood what you said, you know, work with our European partners on these securities issues that are challenging Europe? And we see that everyday with the refugees because it's humanitarian but it's also a security challenge as well?"", 'Well, you know, I—I have been—I remain convinced that we need a concerted effort to really up the costs on Russia, and in particular on Putin. I think we have not done enough. I am in the category of people who wanted us to do more in response to the annexation of Crimea and the continuing destabilization of Ukraine. I understand the hesitation, not only in our country but most importantly, in Europe.', ""The sanctions came out of the all discussions and you know, maybe to some extent they have had you know, some impact. I think the falling oil price has had more impact and we've got to figure out how we you know, combine both in looking at ways to put more—to up the costs, to put more pressure on Putin. I think it's one of the long term security challenges that United States, Europe, and especially NATO face. And I don't think we can dance around it very much longer."", ""I mean, we all wish it wasn't the case. We all wish it would go away. We all wish that Putin would choose to modernize his country and move toward the west, instead of you know, sinking himself deeper into you know, historical roots of czar-like behavior and intimidation along borders, and projecting Russian power in places like Syria and elsewhere."", ""But I think the jury is in, I think that he intends to continue to do what he is doing and go as far as he can get away with. And I believe that we've got to regroup—we've got to regroup quickly, because I worry very much about what's happening in Syria right now."", ""Troops on the ground to allegedly protect military supplies. What is Russia's real objective? You know, the stated objective, the public objective, to fight terrorism, has always been their rationale. Why did they support Assad? Because after Assad there would be terrorism. Now, obviously if we had a different approach from the beginning working together we might've avoided this. We might've actually help to midwife a political transition. So I think we've got to spend a lot more time."", 'All the—you know, all the Russian experts that you know, that thought that their work was done after the fall of the Berlin Wall, I hope that they will be dusting off their materials and I\'m looking right at Strobe Talbott, and you know, get back in the game with us. Because, I think Russia\'s objectives are to stymie and to confront and to undermine American power whenever and wherever they can. I don\'t think there\'s much—you know, I don\'t think there\'s much to be surprised about that.So where we can work with them? You know, that\'s one of the—you know, one of the criticisms that sometimes comes from the right, the Republicans. You know, ""What did the reset ever accomplish?"" Well, Medvedev was president actually quite a lot. We did the New START agreement. We got cooperation on Iran because when we got the Security Council to pass the sanctions that we had been working so hard on, that was under Medvedev in June of 2010. We got support to ship lethal material and equipment across to Russia to resupply our troops. We got a lot.', 'Now, that all changed once you know, Putin announced he was going to be president again now. There\'s—I don\'t admire very much about Mr. Putin, but the idea you can stand and say, ""I will be your next president."" That does have a certain, you know, attraction to it. [laughter]', ""So, you know, I think we've got—we've really—we are not spending the—the time. We're not thinking, we're not digging deep into what are we going to do. So, to answer the question of the—of the woman who asked, we have to do more to get back talking about how we try to confine, contain, deter Russian aggression in Europe and beyond. And try to figure out what are the best tools for doing that and don't lose sight of the architect because we're going to have a lot of issues up there well."", 'So, I—I—I was always of that opinion. Expressed it vocally within the administration. And nothing that has happened since has in anyway persuaded me other wise.', ""QUESTION: And I'll just do a quick follow up on that which is more generally, you know. You—you've got to take on the Russians and Putin. You've got to deal with a very comprehensive strategy for a very complicated part of the world called the Middle East. How do you do the rebalancing to Asia on top of all of this?"", ""CLINTON: Well, I—I do think we're capable of doing more than one thing although sometimes it appears difficult. And—and I think we've got to be much more global in our thinking and globally present. The rebalancing to Asia, otherwise known as the pivot, was in response to the very real sense of abandonment that Asian leaders expressed to me. My phone calls to them before I ever went to the region in February of 2009, you know, they—they believed that because we were focused in Afghanistan and we were so focused in Iraq, and obviously had to be given all that we had invested there, that we were just not paying attention to the developments in Asia. I think we've come along in some ways in trying to rebalance but we have a long to go."", ""And there's much at stake in how we deal with all the players in Asia. I'm hoping that the upcoming trip I have with President Xi Jinping produces some positive outcomes. I thought the climate agreement was quite consequential having been in Copenhagen in '09 with the President when we literally had to break into a meeting where the Chinese were consolidating India, South Africa and Brazil against any kind of movement toward the non advanced economies taking responsibility. So I think we've got some good stakes in the ground but we don't have a—a strategy yet that is going to be consistent."", ""And the final thing I'll say about this, Martin, and I alluded to it in my remarks, I think one of our—one of our real problems right now is we don't have a consistent foreign policy that is bipartisan, let alone non-partisan. And I think that's a problem."", ""I mean, I was appalled when those Republican senators wrote to the ayatollah. I thought it was incredibly, you know, short-sighted and you know, wrong-headed. And I don't think—I don't know what we rebuild a consistent foreign policy from administration to administration, regardless of Republican or Democrat. You know, it was a lot easier in a bipolar world, us versus the Soviet Union, I understand that, but I think we really have to work at it. And we can't work at it if we don't have a set of strategic pillars and organizing principles that we can present to our own people and present to the Congress and present to the world."", 'So I think we have work to do.', 'INDYK: Andrea?', 'QUESTION: Madam Secretary, when you talk about the policies with Syria and Putin, was it, in retrospect, a mistake for the administration after you left office to pull back on Labor Day, a couple of years ago, make the deal with Russia on the chemical weapons? Yes, the weapons were disposed of, but that created a different partnership, if you will, on diplomacy.', ""And secondly, with reference to our colleague from Germany, what should America do to step up to the crisis of migration? Even if it's not on our front door, it is a moral issue, is it not, for the world? Thank you."", ""CLINTON: As to the first one, you know, it's always difficult in hindsight to say what could have happened if something different had been done. IF we remember back to that time, prime minister Cameron had lost the vote in the parliament. He wanted to show support for the president's policy of taking some limited military action in light of Syria's use of chemical weapons."", 'So it became clear that there was going to be a difficult vote in the Congress, not clear at all that it would successful, which would have left the president with authority, certainly, with executive authority to act. But since it had become a public debate, it would have been a much more difficult decision for him to make.', ""I do think that not being able to follow through on it cost us. I am certain of that. That still comes back in conversations that people have with me, both here at home and—and people from other countries, but I do think it was a net positive to get as much of the chemical weapons out as we could, and there was no way we could have done that without Russian cooperation. I think there was hope after that kind of cooperation produced positive results that then, we could go back to talking more broadly with the Russians about what needed to be done in Syria and what needed to be done with Assad. They did not reciprocate on that. So you know, I think it's like much in—in international relations, it's a—it's a mixed picture, some positive, you know, some—some negative."", 'With respect to the refugees, I have said I think that you know, we\'re coming up on the U.N. General Assembly. I think there should be an emergency global gathering where the U.N. literally tries to get commitments. You know, we did that with Haiti. After the Haiti earthquake, we had a huge gathering at the U.N. where literally it was like a pledging conference, where we said, ""What are you going to do?"" What—you know, ""What can you contribute?""', ""And little countries to big countries all stepped up and it was a great show of support in the face of a terrible natural disaster. We need to do something similar, and I've—I've publicly called on the U.N. to convene such a gathering. I do it again today in front of all of you."", ""The United States has to be at the table, has to be leading it. We were in a strong position to do that on Haiti. I think, even though it's not on our doorstep, we have a real interest in working not just with our European friends, I think this is a global responsibility. And if you're too far away or for whatever reason you don't think you can take refugees then you have to contribute money."", 'You should be supporting not only those refugees fleeing, but the incredible work that Jordan and Lebanon and Turkey have been doing, and they have not gotten the financial support they need. In fact, the last I checked, the U.N. appeal had only reached 37 percent, so there is both financial work and contributions that need to be forthcoming and countries need to be more open and willing to take refugees.', 'I obviously want the United States to do our part but I also want this to be a global response. So I hope that with all these leaders gathered, with Pope Francis addressing the United Nations General Assembly in just about two weeks, we can see something like that very visible with people literally making their commitments nation by nation, or in the case of the EU or other organizations as well.', ""INDYK: I think we're going to have to close it out, but I see two hands going up. Do you mind taking two together? First is Ivan and then Joe."", 'QUESTION: Madam Secretary, I also want to add my thanks for a very forceful, unequivocal, and clear speech bringing a position that sounds eminently defensible. One of the silver linings potentially of the Iran deal is an alignment of interest in the region between Israel and the moderate Arab countries, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, et cetera—the gulf states. If you agree with that, how would you see capitalizing on those shared interests, those concerns about Iran going forward? How would you promote the shared interests as a way of bridging more peace to the region?', 'INDYK: Joe, quick question?', ""QUESTION: Joe (Santioni), the pleasure is mine. Thank you for your measured and fact based approach to this. Let me bring you to the politics of the issue. What explains that we don't have a single Republic senator in support of this? Is this is ideological divide between the parties? Or raw partisan politics?"", ""CLINTON: Well I'll restrain myself and answer the first questions first. I think there is an opportunity here to succeed, I really do. I don't think it's easy. But let's just go back a few years."", 'Not so long ago, Israel and Turkey were working very closely together on a number of issues. Then came the flotilla and then came the response by the Israeli military, then came many years of you know, real hard feelings that got harder and harder and we lost what was a—not just a - a working relationship but a real bridge.', 'Similarly, there have been a number of instances where in the past, Israel has worked in common concert with a number of the gulf countries. Israel is now back in a very productive relationship with Egypt, obviously with Jordan. So there are the pieces of national and regional interests here that I think very diligently and probably frustratingly could be pulled back together.', ""\xa0I don't—I don't know that it's something the United States can lead, but it's certainly something that we can try to catalyze and encourage. And I think there is potential there because as I said in my speech, I will do everything I can to convince Turkey and (Qatar) that supporting Hamas is not in their interest. It's not in the region's interest. It's certainly not in Egypt's interest. They both care deeply about, you know, what happens in Egypt for somewhat different reasons than others, but they care."", 'And so I think we have to build the case and I think American diplomats could help build that case. And then look for ways—I mean, I spent, you know, literally years trying to get the Israelis to finally apologize to the Turks on the flotilla. And there was a memorable day during one of my vacations where I was literally, you know, talking to the Israelis. I was talking to Henry Kissinger. I was talking to everybody I could find to make the strategic argument which we all believed, that the sooner Israel did that, the sooner they could get back to some kind of discussion perhaps.', ""Finally that happened when President Obama went to Israel. And I was very happy that, you know, now we have a different Turkey with a different kind of, set of challenges, but interests remain the same. Turkey's interest for stability are not so different than they were, even though some of the leadership attitudes seem to have altered. So I would like to see us do everything we can. I would make a high priority of that."", ""I hope that this administration in the last, you know, year-and-a-half or so of it, term, will be similarly doing that because, let's start seeing what we can do. It kind of goes back to Robin's question. You know, you don't know what you can achieve until you try to put the pieces together. And I think the more we can try to put those pieces together, the more we'll know whether or not something can come up."", ""With respect to the lack of support for the agreement, honestly, I think it's—it's—it's in some instances genuine. Just as I said in my remarks, there are people who I deeply respect on the Democratic side certainly and I would respect them on the Republican side as well, who just have concerns that they don't feel have been answered. But I think the driving force behind it is, you know, to close ranks against the president, against this kind of diplomacy, but without offering an alternative."", ""And that's what I find, I mean I don't mind debating alternatives. I mean, when we did the New Start Treaty, it was really hard to get the votes for that. I remember, you know, going up and making the case, but we got some Republican votes. But we're living in a very partisan atmosphere right now. And I do think we have to do more. Just as we, and I'll end with this by saying, just as we have to in diplomacy, reach out to people constantly, if not to persuade them to join with us, to eliminate an argument that they have, that they won't join, because they have been consulted. They have been brought along, they have been briefed. We have to do that with the Congress as well. And it's not—it's not easy if they don't even have open minds."", 'But we still have to do it so we can be in the position of saying, you know, ""We told you this, we offered you this, we briefed you this, we gave you this information and you haven\'t come forth with any kind of, you know, rational, or rationale to oppose us.\xa0 You\'re just opposing us. So it\'s—it\'s—it\'s very political, after discounting those who I think are—are genuinely skeptical.', 'INDYK: Madame Secretary Hillary, thank you very much for—for a very powerful series and—and clear-headed explication of your position on Iran, Middle East and even broader. This is precisely what we expect from you and precisely what we at Brookings want to try to promote in this presidential debate, so we are very grateful to you.', 'Please join me in thanking Hillary.

I assume you watched it, especially from the lone female candidate up on the stage, Carly Fiorina.', ""She said if you want to stump a Democrat, she said, ask them about Hillary Clinton's accomplishments as secretary of State."", 'If you were on that debate stage with her, what would you say was your number one accomplishment as secretary of State?', ""CLINTON: You know, Wolf, I didn't get to see all of their debate, but I saw enough of it to know that this is just the usual back and forth political attacks, the kinds of things you say when you're on a debate stage and you really don't have much else to say."", ""I didn't hear anything from any of them about how they're going to make college more affordable or get down student debt, or get equal pay for equal work for women, what they're going to do to make sure that we deal with the challenges of raising incomes for hardworking people."", ""So I don't really pay a lot of attention to this kind of rhetoric that heats up the debate stage. They're all trying to vie for more attention from, obviously, the Republican Party. I'm going to let them decide how best to do it."", 'But if anybody is interested, you know, there\'s a long list about what I have done and I\'m very proud of it. You can read my book, ""Hard Choices,"" read about how I negotiated a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. You can read about how I put together the coalition that led to international sanctions against Iran. You can read about what I did when I was first lady to get the children\'s health insurance program, or as senator, working across the aisle on issues like getting better health care for our veterans.', 'You know, this is just the silly season. I am looking forward to eventually debating on that stage whoever they finally nominate once they get around to doing that.', 'BLITZER: All right, so listen to what Carly Fiorina also said, Madam Secretary, about some controversial videos opposing Planned Parenthood, an organization you support.', 'Listen to this.', '[begin video clip]', 'CARLY FIORINA, GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, to watch these tapes, watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.', 'This is about the character of our nation.', '[end video clip]', 'BLITZER: All right, Planned Parenthood...', 'CLINTON: You know, of course not...', ""BLITZER:?—says that video doesn't depict—Madam Secretary, hold on.

They says—they said that was from a miscarriage, it had nothing to do with Planned Parenthood."", 'This is an organization, though, you support.', 'First of all, have you seen those very, very controversial videos?', ""CLINTON: Well, Wolf, let's—let's break down what's happening here, because I think it's important. I know that there's a move on by some of the Republicans in the Congress to actually shut down the United States government over their demand that we no longer give federal funding to Planned Parenthood to perform the really necessary health services that they do for millions of women."", ""So let's put aside for a moment here that there is no debate and there should be absolutely no argument that Planned Parenthood does cancer screenings, it helps provide family planning and contraceptive advice, it works to provide, you know, some of the most difficult kinds of counseling when it comes to giving an HIV test, for example."", 'What this is about is the fact that some of the Planned Parenthood facilities perform abortions, which is legal under the laws of the United States.', 'I understand that the Republican Party and particularly the candidates we heard from last night, wish that were not the case, wish that abortion were illegal and they could turn the clock back.', 'So I think we ought to be very clear that Planned Parenthood has served to provide health care, necessary health care for millions of women. And I think it deserves not only our support, but the continuing funding from the federal government so that these women and girls who are seeking the kinds of services that are provided will be able to achieve that.', ""BLITZER: All right, have you—are you confident that Planned Parenthood, Madam Secretary, or any of its affiliated groups, if you will, haven't violated any federal laws?"", 'CLINTON: Well, Wolf, let me tell you what I know, and that is there is a—a willingness on the part of Planned Parenthood to answer questions. They have been doing so. Some people may not want to hear the answers, but they have certainly put those answers out there into the public arena.', 'And if the issue—the core issue that some on the stage last night or some in the Congress are trying to promote or trying to raise questions about has to do with the kind of research that is done legally in the United States, then that is an issue that goes far beyond any Planned Parenthood example.', ""So I—I think it's important to sort out—there's a lot of emotion. There's a lot of accusations that are being hurled about. I think it's important to sort out and try to actually figure out what is going on. If it's the services that they are trying to shut down, like providing family planning or breast cancer screenings, that is just wrong and women deserve to be given support to get those services provided."", ""If they want to shut down the legal provision of abortion services, then they've got a bigger problem, because, obviously, they—Planned Parenthood does not use federal dollars to do that."", ""And if they are more focused on the research that is going on, then that's a set of issues that certainly is not only about Planned Parenthood."", 'So I—I would hope...', 'BLITZER: But a...', 'CLINTON:?—that the Republicans, and particularly the Republicans in the House, led by Speaker Boehner, would not put our country and our economy in peril pursuing some kind of emotionally politically charged partisan attack on Planned Parenthood to shut our government down.', 'BLITZER: All right...', 'CLINTON: I think that would be a very, very unfortunate decision.', ""BLITZER: All right, let's talk about another source of criticism you received last night, this one from the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie.

And it really doesn't deserve any comment."", ""BLITZER: It took you a long time to say you're sorry about what happened, the mistakes you made in organizing that server to begin with."", 'Why did it take so long?', ""CLINTON: Well, you know, I was trying to explain, uh, what had happened and obviously it was clear that I should have used two different email accounts and I said that that was a mistake, I'm sorry, I've taken responsibility."", ""But I've also, for more than a year now, been asking to testify before the Congressional committee that is investigating the situation in Benghazi, they would not let me appear."", ""Finally—and I'm very happy about this—I will be appearing, toward the end of October, and I will look forward to answer all their questions."", ""I'm trying to be as transparent as possible. That's why people are reading the contents of the emails that are being released. It's why I've turned over my server. It's why I will testify."", ""BLITZER: You've dismissed Donald Trump's campaign as entertainment, suggested, in part, he's not really serious. But the top Republican candidate right now, Donald Trump, and, for that matter, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, they're all political outsiders and your main Democratic opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, he's pulling ahead in some of these polls in New Hampshire and Iowa. He's running as an outsider, as well."", 'So how do you deal with that?', 'Why is Bernie Sanders, for example, ahead of you in these polls in New Hampshire and Iowa right now?', ""CLINTON: Well, I—I've said for a long time, polls are going to go up, they're going to go down. I'm very confident and very comfortable about our strategy. I feel that our campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire, all the early states, and now we're moving on to the states that come after, are really coming together well."", ""I'm excited by the level and intensity of the support that I have. So I always thought this would be a competitive election. I'm looking forward to it. This is an important job. This is the most important job not only in our country, but in the world. And people have to fight hard. They have to make their case and they have to earn the votes of the American voters."", ""BLITZER: You sat next to Joe Biden when you were the secretary of State for four years. He's been the vice president of the United States now for almost seven years, a heartbeat away from the presidency."", ""If he does decide to run, will you be able to tell the American people that you're more qualified to be president than he is?"", ""CLINTON: Well, Wolf, I'm not going to comment on a hypothetical and I'm certainly not going to comment on my good friend and former colleague. He has to make up his own mind about what's best for him and his family, as he wrestles with his choice."", ""But I will tell the American people I believe that my set of experiences, my plans for the future, my vision for what America should be, what I've already told voters I would do on everything from making college affordable to paying down student debt to tackling climate change by making us the clean energy superpower, dealing with substance abuse and addiction, like I did here in New Hampshire today."", ""I have a very comprehensive agenda that I think address the very issues that Americans are talking to me about. And I know that having been around the presidency, both as the first lady in the '90s and then as a member of President Obama's cabinet, working with other presidents, as a senator and even in private life, I feel very confident that I'm the right person at the right time to lead our country to deal with the growing issues around incomes that are not raising enough money for people to feel they've got a better future, about the kind of jobs we need more of, about how more workers get to share in the productivity by sharing the profits of what they helped produce."", ""I'm the one out there talking very specifically about what I would do because I want to run a campaign that lays out my agenda, because when I get elected, I'm going to start working on it immediately."", ""BLITZER: I know—I know your time is limited. A quick question, are you ready to tell Democrats, indeed, the American public today, that you're ready to accept more Democratic presidential debates than already scheduled?"", ""You're under pressure to do so."", 'CLINTON: Well, Wolf, I have said from the very beginning, I look forward to debating. I look forward to the debate, you know, next month, you know, now just a month away. And I will certainly show up anywhere the Democratic National Committee tells us to show up, because I want us to have a good exchange of ideas and to make sure that Democratic voters first, and then general voters to follow, see exactly what we each stand for and what our positions are.', 'So, you know, I—I am ready and willing, no matter what they decide to show up and be there.', 'BLITZER: Are you ready to ask the DNC to authorize more Democratic presidential debates?', ""CLINTON: That's up to them. They can, you know, they made their decision. But I have made it clear that if they want to do more, I'm happy to do them."", ""BLITZER: Clearly, you're influential, though, with the DNC. And if you want more debates, I'm sure that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the DNC, would—would go ahead."", 'Let me ask you one final question before I let you go.', ""You've praised your husband as a great president."", 'So let me ask you this.', 'Would you be a better president than Bill Clinton was as president of the United States? [laughter]', ""CLINTON: Oh, Wolf, you know, that—that's one of those questions that I cannot and will not answer. I will say this. I think if you look at the last 35 years, actually, if you go back further, I think it's pretty indisputable that having a Democrat in the White House is good for our economy, better for our economy than the alternative."", 'I think my husband understood that and produced. I think President Obama inherited a—a really big and dangerous mess and has, you know, been able to get us out of that ditch.', ""So I'm not running for my husband's third term. I'm certainly not running for President Obama's third term. I'm running for my first term."", 'But I do believe that both of them understood what it would take to try to clean up the messes they inherited from their Republican predecessors and begin to get the economy and the country working again for everybody.', ""And that's exactly the kind of president I will be, as well."", 'BLITZER: Madam Secretary, thank you so much for joining us.', 'Good luck out there on the campaign trail.', ""We'll look forward to covering you. We'll look forward to covering, obviously, all of those Democratic presidential debates, as well."", 'Thanks very much for joining us.', 'CLINTON: Thank you so much, Wolf.', 'Good to talk to you.', 'BLITZER: Thank you.']"
17,            Hillary Clinton          ,"September 20, 2015","[""DICKERSON: We're joined by Democratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Welcome, Secretary Clinton. We're glad to have you."", ""Let's start in the news, Syrian refugees."", 'CLINTON: Right.', 'DICKERSON: President Obama has said he will increase the number allowed into 10,000. Is that enough?', ""CLINTON: Now, look, we're facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II."", 'And I think United States has to do more. And I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000, and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in, looking to really emphasize some of those who are most vulnerable, a lot of the persecuted religious minorities, including Christians, and some who have been brutalized, like the Yazidi women.', 'But I also want the United States to lead the world. And I have recommended that, at the upcoming U.N. General Assembly, there be an international meeting called by the secretary-general and literally get people to commit, putting money in, helping the front-line states, like Jordan and Turkey and Lebanon, who have absorbed a lot of refugees, working with the E.U. and the European countries, but getting everybody to make a contribution.', 'DICKERSON: Let me ask you about the underlying condition creating this refugee crisis.', 'You advocated for arming the Syrian rebels.', 'CLINTON: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.', 'DICKERSON: That was then ultimately put in place. We now hear that that is not going well at all. Out of 12,000 Syrians that have been trained, there are only handful that can actually fight.', 'Was this a bad idea, or was this a bad idea—or was this a good idea poorly executed?', 'CLINTON: Well, John, I did recommend that, at the beginning of this conflict, we do more to help train those who were in the forefront of leading the opposition against Assad, looking to try to bring the moderates together.', 'A lot of these rebels, originally, they were—they were businesspeople, they were professional people, they were students. They had no training in going up against the Syrian army, which Assad clearly was going to use to the ultimate effect. That was not the decision taken at that time.', 'A lot of what I worried about has happened. There are now big ungoverned territories within Syria that are dominated by terrorist groups, ISIS being the best known, but not the only one. You have Iran and Russia increasingly moving in to support Assad and his constant bombardment against his own people.', 'And then you have these millions of refugees. So, where we are today is not where we were. And where we are today is that we have a failed program. You heard the testimony, five people trained for half—$500, half-a-billion dollars.', 'But I think we still have to keep working with the Turks, with the Jordanians, with others of our partners. We also have to do more to support the Kurds, something that I have also advocated.', 'DICKERSON: Let me ask you about Russia.', ""So, it looks like U.S. policy now is, we're not going to—train and equip has failed, so now we're going to turn to the Russians for help. These are the same Russians who are busy in Ukraine doing things we don't like them to do. The Israelis think that the Russians are involved with Hezbollah. Why are we turning to the Russians?"", ""CLINTON: Well, I hope we're not turning to the Russians."", ""Let me just quickly say that I wouldn't give up on train and equip, but I sure would push the Pentagon to take hard look why what has been done has been such a failure and what more we could do to support, like, Kurdish fighters who are on the front lines."", 'And one of the difficulties we had in the train and equip is that we basically were trying to train people to only take on ISIS and terrorist networks. We were not training and equipping them to take on Assad or his military or his proxies, which include Hezbollah, by the way.', ""I hope we are not turning to the Russians in that way. I hope what we're doing—and this is what I support—and I heard Secretary Kerry say this is what we will be doing. And I think Secretary Carter has begun these conversations."", 'First of all, we have to figure out what they are doing. Russia has a long interest in Syria. They have had a base in—a naval base in Syria for a long time. They have a connection because a lot of Syrians were educated in the Cold War in Moscow and a lot of Russians actually moved to Syria.', ""So, they have not only deep links to Syria and Syrians, but they intend to support Assad for their own reasons. And we need to really unpeel what it is they're trying to accomplish and work with others to try to contain them."", 'And I want to just end by saying, if they are providing any equipment to Hezbollah, if they are supporting Hezbollah, which is the main fighting force on behalf of the Iranians to support Assad, but also a deadly threat to Israel, then we have got to take action, whether there are tougher sanctions or other kinds of actions to try to prevent that from happening.', 'DICKERSON: I want to ask you about something that came up in the Republican debate. Jeb Bush said, one thing was true about his brother. He kept America safe.', 'Do you agree with that?', ""CLINTON: I think it's a complicated question, because, of course, 9/11 happened."", 'I was a senator from New York. And I was basically consumed by my responsibility to help the people directly affected in my state and in the city.', ""So, it did happen. And then I do give President Bush credit for trying to bring the country together around the threats that we did face. I have said the war in Iraq was a mistake. I supported what happened in Afghanistan. So, if you sort it all out, you know, it's a mixed—it's a mixed picture."", 'DICKERSON: Let me take you back to the 2008 campaign, where Iraq was a conversation and U.S. security was a conversation.', 'You ran an ad, the 3:00 a.m. ad...', 'CLINTON: Yes.', ""DICKERSON: ... which became quite famous. Let's play that for our—our viewers."", ""CLINTON: My gosh. I haven't seen that in a long time. [laughter]"", ""DICKERSON: Well, it's a throwback Sunday here."", '[begin video clip]', ""NARRATOR: It's 3:00 a.m., and your children are safe and asleep. Who do you want answering the phone?"", ""CLINTON: I'm Hillary Clinton. And I approve this message."", '[end video clip]', '[laughter]', 'DICKERSON: So, the question for you is, now you have been secretary of state.', 'CLINTON: Right.', 'DICKERSON: Benghazi.', 'CLINTON: Right.', 'DICKERSON: Was that your 3:00 a.m. phone call? And how well did you handle that crisis, by the standard you raised in that ad?', 'CLINTON: Well, of course it was a crisis. And we lost four brave Americans, including the person that I asked the president to send as ambassador, Chris Stevens.', ""But we live in a dangerous world. And even our diplomats are at threat. And that goes all the way back to, for goodness' sake, taking over our embassy in Tehran or the bombings of our embassy in Beirut, when President Reagan was in charge."", 'This is a dangerous world. And I think what we had to do during that period of time, in trying to protect our people after the attack on the consulate, getting them evacuated, not only working on what was going on in Libya, because, remember, we had embassies that were under attack or threatened to attack by terrorist groups across North Africa, indeed, across a much larger swathe of the world.', 'So, I think it was terribly tragic, what happened. I immediately asked for an independent review, just like former secretaries of state did. And I made that public. And the only other person who did that was Secretary Albright after our embassies were bombed in Africa.', ""So, my view on this is, we have to learn things. And we are always learning. We learned after Beirut. We learned after Tanzania and Kenya. We have learned after Benghazi, but we're not going to be able to represent the United States working out of hermetically sealed tanks. We are going to have to be out in the world."", 'DICKERSON: One more question on Benghazi. The charge is, in this campaign, that after it happened, there was a report inside the State Department and inside the government that this was a terrorist attack.', 'But in what we heard from the government at the time and from you was an emphasis on this video, that that had created the attack. And so the charge is that there was a political pressure to make the case more about the video than to talk about terrorism.', ""CLINTON: Well, I just don't think that's fair. And I'm going to testify about this at the end of October before the committee looking into this. I think it's the eighth investigation that the Congress has conducted."", 'There were two things going on simultaneously. I and others said that we were attacked. There was no doubt about that. That video, which was still spinning through the world, was being mentioned on social media. We had people climbing the walls at our embassy in Cairo even before the attack in Benghazi.', 'And we had a lot of other attacks. I had to call the president of one of our neighboring countries, Tunis, to try to get—in Tunis—to get them to help protect our embassy. So, I was worried about everything that was going on and how people were responding to that from North Africa to Pakistan, all the way to Indonesia.', 'DICKERSON: So, no political pressure to keep the story kind of a little more favorable to the administration?', 'CLINTON: Well, all I can tell you, I never felt any political pressure or did I feel any political reason to do anything other than what we tried to do, which was to immediately deal with the problems that were coming at us.', 'DICKERSON: So, questions about Benghazi have led to discovery of your personal server.', ""If we use this episode as a way to think about the way would you run your presidency, let's say there's a meeting at Clinton headquarters, and you're with your staff. And you're saying, looking at the e-mail situation from the day you decided, yes, to have the server, all the way to where we all now..."", 'CLINTON: Right.', ""DICKERSON: ... what went well, what didn't go so well?"", ""CLINTON: Well, look, I have said that I didn't make the best choice."", 'I should have used two separate e-mail accounts, one personal, one work-related. What I did was allowed. It was fully above board. People in the government certainly knew that I was using a personal e-mail.', ""But I have tried to be transparent. And that includes releasing 55,000 pages, which is unprecedented—nobody else that I'm aware of has ever done that—plus turning over the server, plus testifying at the end of October."", 'So, I think that people have questions. I want to try to answer them.', 'DICKERSON: Was it a failure in judgment on your part?', 'CLINTON: Well, look, it was permitted. It was allowed. I did it.', 'And I think that people can make their own judgments about that. But I have tried to be as transparent as I can.', ""DICKERSON: You talked a lot about transparency, that—when we think about trust—and there's been a lot of talk about that in your campaign and voters having questions. They have questions maybe related to this."", 'Trust and transparency are related. You have been transparent in the release of these e-mails, but what about before? Because there was a period where you held on to the whole kit and caboodle before any investigators were asking for it, long after you were out of the State Department.', ""CLINTON: Well, it wasn't that long. What I did was to send e-mails to people at their government accounts, which I had every reason to believe would be captured on the government systems."", ""And when we were asked to help the State Department make sure they had everything from other secretaries of state, not just me, I'm the one who said, OK, great, I will go through them again. And we provided all of them. And more than 90 percent were already in the system."", 'And, in fact, I gave so many that were not work-related, just to be as comprehensive as possible, they are already sending back about 1,200 of them.', ""So, look, I did what was, as I said, allowed. I said it wasn't the best choice. And it turned out to be a mistake, in retrospect. But, at the time, and given the fact that most of them were in the government systems, people are going to get a chance to see all kinds of behind-the-scenes conversations, most of which, I'm embarrassed to say, are kind of boring. [laughter]"", 'DICKERSON: Just to button this up here, you have said you were sorry.', 'CLINTON: Yes.', 'DICKERSON: What exactly are you sorry for and to whom?', ""CLINTON: Well, you know, I'm sorry that I made a choice that has raised all of these questions, because I don't like reading that people have questions about what I did and how I did it."", ""I'm proud of the work we did at the State Department. And I'm really proud of all the career professionals I worked with. I'm proud of the people who came in with me. And we got sanctions on Iran, put together that international coalition. We got a new arms treaty with Russia. We did a lot of really important work."", 'And I want that to be the focus of what people know about my tenure at the State Department.', ""DICKERSON: Some people who know you and have worked with you say what this e-mail situation suggests is that there's nobody around you who can say, Secretary Clinton, this is a bad idea, don't do this."", 'Do you have such a person?', '[crosstalk]', '[laughter]', 'CLINTON: I have too many, actually. Look, this—this was...', 'DICKERSON: No, before the fact, not after. After, everybody is giving you advice.', 'CLINTON: I know.', 'No, but, John this was done by prior government officials, including...', 'DICKERSON: But not at this level, not solely a server just for you.', ""CLINTON: You know, look, let's—it was done by others."", ""And let me just say that, yes, when I did it, it was allowed, it was above board. And now I'm being as transparent as possible, more than anybody else ever has been."", 'DICKERSON: All right.', 'Secretary Clinton, we are going to pause right there.', 'CLINTON: OK.', 'DICKERSON: We will be back in one more minute with more from Secretary Clinton.', 'Stay with us.', '[commercial break]', ""DICKERSON: We're back now with Secretary Clinton."", 'Secretary Clinton, Donald Trump had a supporter at one of his rallies suggest the president was Muslim and not an American. Donald Trump stayed mute and continues to say nothing about that.', 'Are politicians on the hook for every crazy thing one of their supporters stands up and says?', ""CLINTON: Well, of course not, because we all have supporters who may say things that we don't agree with."", 'But when you are at an event and someone stands up and says something like that in front of you, then I do think you have a responsibility to respond.', ""John McCain did back in the '08 campaign when somebody in one of his events said something similarly untrue and insulting about the president. And McCain stopped that person. That's what Donald Trump should have done."", 'And I said the other day he is fueling a level of paranoia and prejudice against all kinds of people. And when you light those fires, you better recognize that they can get out of control. And he should start dampening them down and putting them out.', ""He wants to talk about what he would do as president. That's obviously fair game. But to play into some of the worst impulses that people have these days that are really being lit up by the Internet and other conspiracy-minded theories is just irresponsible. It's appalling."", '[crosstalk]', 'DICKERSON: Which Republican would you like to run against the most?', ""CLINTON: Oh, John, I have no—I have no vote in that. I'm going to run against whoever they put up against me."", 'DICKERSON: Are you doing anything to prepare for Joe Biden potentially entering the race? Is your campaign doing anything?', ""CLINTON: No, we're not, because this is such a personal decision."", ""And the vice president has to sort this out. He's been so open in talking about how difficult this time is for him and his family. And he's obviously considering what he wants to do, including whether he wants to run. And I just have the greatest respect and affection for him. And I think everybody just ought to give him the space to decide what is best for him and his family."", ""DICKERSON: Bernie Sanders has made quite a point of not attacking you. He said he's not going to run any negative ads."", 'Would you pledge to do the same thing with respect to him, not attack him, and also tell your supporters, hey, lay off?', 'CLINTON: Look, I want this to be about ideas and about policies.', ""I know Bernie. I respect his enthusiastic and intense advocacy of his ideas. That's what I want this campaign to be about. And I hope people who support me respect that, because this is a serious election. I obviously am running because I think it's better for the country if a Democrat who has the kind of approaches and values that my husband had and Barack Obama has follows this presidency."", 'DICKERSON: So, can I mark that down as a yes?', 'CLINTON: Yes.', 'DICKERSON: You will pledge not to?', 'CLINTON: Well, I have no—no interest in doing that.', ""DICKERSON: And you're going to talk about Obamacare this week, support it."", 'CLINTON: Yes, I am.', ""DICKERSON: What is the big new proposal you're going to offer?"", ""CLINTON: Well, first, let me say that it's time that we say that the debate over the Affordable Care Act is over. The Supreme Court has twice upheld it, yet the Congress has voted more than 50 times to repeal it."", ""Let's get beyond that. Enough is enough. And we need to strengthen it, not scrap it. It is the core of how we're going to provide health care to Americans going forward, the 16 million."", ""But there are other benefits to it that people who are not on the exchanges are being able to take advantage of. You know, 158 million American women are no longer charged more for health care because of our gender. Young people can stay on their parents' policies until they're 26."", ""If you have a preexisting condition, insurance companies can't shut you out. We have a lot of positives. But there are issues that need to be addressed. I'm going to address them this week, starting with how we're going to try to control the cost of skyrocketing prescription drugs. It's something that I hear about wherever I go. It's part of the plan I will be rolling out in the next few days."", 'DICKERSON: Let me ask you about those Planned Parenthood videos. Have you watched them?', 'CLINTON: I have seen excerpts from them. And I have certainly read about them.', 'And what I am troubled by are the misleading, inaccurate allegations about them that we heard from Republicans at their debate. This is really an attack on Planned Parenthood, which provides a lot of health services, from cancer screenings , to contraceptive services, to so many other of the needs women have.', ""And to shut down the government, which some Republicans are advocating, over funding for Planned Parenthood, which takes care of millions of women's health needs, is just the height of irresponsibility."", ""DICKERSON: That's the policy debate this has turned into. But what was your reaction just when you watched them?"", 'CLINTON: Well, look, as Planned Parenthood has said, these were misleadingly edited. They were intentionally taken out of context.', ""The fact is that, if we want to have a debate in this country about whether we should continue using—or doing fetal research, then it's not only Planned Parenthood that should be involved in that debate. All of the experts, all of the scientists, all of the research institutions, everybody who is looking for cures to Parkinson's, for example, should be asked, should we continue this?"", 'But so far as I am aware, what they did, despite the way it was portrayed, is within the laws that were set up for this.', 'DICKERSON: This week, the Senate is going to vote to impose a federal ban on late-term abortions. Do you support a federal limit on abortion at any stage of pregnancy?', ""CLINTON: This is one of those really painful questions that people raise. And, obviously, it's really emotional."", ""I think that the kind of late-term abortions that take place are because of medical necessity. And, therefore, I would hate to see the government interfering with that decision. I think that, again, this gets back to whether you respect a woman's right to choose or not. And I think that is what this whole argument once again is about."", 'DICKERSON: In the politics this year, it looks like everybody wants an outsider. [laughter]', ""Now, that puts you in a fix....[crosstalk]...Does it put you in a fix? Tell us why it doesn't put you in a fix."", ""CLINTON: I cannot imagine anyone being more of an outsider than the first woman president. I mean, really, let's think about that."", 'DICKERSON: Now, I agree, but your name—we have not...', 'CLINTON: I mean, if you line up—if you—all these mothers and fathers bring me the place mats with all the presidents, and they bring their daughters, and they say, my daughter has a question for you. And the daughter says, how come there are no girls on this place mat?', 'DICKERSON: I agree that that is a difference.', ""CLINTON: I think that's a pretty big unconventional choice."", ""DICKERSON: Yes. But you know what I'm asking."", ""CLINTON: Well, I know you're asking, do we want people who have never been elected to anything, who have no political experience, who have never made any hard choices in the public arena? Well, voters are going to have to decide that."", ""DICKERSON: But they worry that people who are inside are too inside, that that's why the economic situation is tilted against the middle class. It's why they always feel like everybody can wiggle around the rules."", ""And that's something you have to deal with, right?"", 'CLINTON: Of course it is.', ""And that's why I have an economic policy that is centered on raising incomes, because I think what we inherited from the Bush administration, what President Obama had to deal with had the potential of becoming a great depression, not just a great recession."", 'We have now recovered 13 million jobs, after losing 800,000 a month when he came into office. So, why would we go back to the same policies? Call them insider. Call them tilted toward the rich. Call them giving corporations a free pass to do whatever they want.', ""I'm against that. I have always been against that. I want to go back to economic policies where we create millions of new jobs and where people's incomes rise not just at the top, but in the middle and at the bottom, like they did under my husband."", ""So, you know, I'm not running for Bill's third term. I'm not running for President Obama's third term. But it would be really foolish of me not to say, you know, that worked better than what the Republicans offer."", 'DICKERSON: What role should Wall Street play in the economy?', 'CLINTON: Look, we need financial markets.', ""But they need to be put on notice that any of their behaviors that impact Main Street, that disrupt the kind of orderly processing of financial transactions because high-frequency trading is now going to be making decisions in nanoseconds, or fooling around, as they did in the '80s, in packaging mortgage securities in a way that really bombed us into the great resection, I don't think any financial institution, not just banks, because I think it's important to recognize there are a lot of financial institutions."", 'AIG was a problem. Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. They were not banks in the traditional sense. We need to rein in the risks posed by these financial institutions.', 'DICKERSON: Let me—a final question.', 'Your friend the late Diane Blair wrote in her diary—quote—""On her deathbed, Clinton wants to be able to say she was true to herself and is not going to do phony makeovers to please others.""', ""So, knowing you don't want to engage in phony makeovers, give us three words that is the real Hillary Clinton. [laughter] Just three."", ""CLINTON: Just three? I can't possibly do that."", ""I mean, look, I am a real person, with all the pluses and minuses that go along with being that. And I have been in the public eye for so long that I think—you know, it's like the feature that you see in some magazines sometimes. Real people actually go shopping, you know?"", ""DICKERSON: All right. Well, I'm going to have to really interrupt you."", 'Thank you, Secretary Clinton.', 'CLINTON: Thanks, John.', 'DICKERSON: Democratic presidential—Hillary Clinton, we hope to talk to you again soon.

First of all, as I have said very often, all of the e-mails that I sent were intended to be in the government systems if they were work related. That's why I sent them to people at their work a dresses. And, you know, the vast majority of them ended up there."", ""So I have said also that if I had to do it all over again I would have used a separate e-mail account. I did it for convenience and it turned out not to be that at all. But the bottom line is my e-mails were predominantly in the State Department system or on other government servers and then I said I'm going to give them all after a very careful review and I did so."", 'TODD: All right. I want to unpack a couple of things there but let me start with just the news of this week. You had said in a written statement under oath that you had turned over everything that you believed you had for the federal records with those 55,000 e-mails but we have now discovered an e-mail chain between then General Petraeus and yourself that took place a couple of months before these records started.', 'Can you explain the discrepancy there? It was the same e-mail address that you used while at state that you were using with General Petraeus just two months before you said everything was out there.', 'CLINTON: Well, everything that we had access to was certainly out there and the reason we know about the e-mail chain with General Petraeus is because it was on a government server. And so from my perspective we have a very thorough review process that we conducted and my attorneys supervised it, they went through everything and what we had available at the time was turned over.', ""TODD: But I guess what I'm trying to figure out is if you said in March that the e-mail system began in March of '09 yet but we have the same e-mail address popping up in January, explain that discrepancy."", ""CLINTON: There was a transition period. I wasn't that focused on my e-mail account to be clear here."", ""TODD: Let me stop you there. You say you weren't focused on it except this seemed to be—to put an e-mail server at your house is not a—it's a complicated thing."", ""CLINTON: Yes, but it was already there. It had been there for years. It is the system that my husband's personal office used when he got out of the White House so it was sitting there in the basement. It was not any trouble at all. I know there are a lot of people who are questioning that."", ""But the fact is that it was there. I added my account to it. It apparently took a little time to do that and so there was about a month where I didn't have everything already on the server. We went back and tried to recover whatever we could recover."", ""And I think it's also fair to say that there are some things about this that I just can't control. I can't control the technical aspects of it. I'm not by any means a technical expert. I relied on people who were and we have done everything we could in response to the State Department asking us to do this review because they asked all the former secretaries."", 'And the reason they asked, Chuck, is because they found gaps in their own recordkeeping. You know, my assumption—because this system was there before I became secretary—it was there when I left—my assumption was anything that I sent to a dot-gov account would be captured.', ""TODD: But, you know, that's very difficult to capture all of your e-mails by going to perhaps thousands of people and their dot-gov accounts. It would have been easier if it was sent to your dot-gov account."", ""CLINTON: Well, but when you communicate with people in other parts of the government you're not sending it to the State Department dot-gov and that would have been true either way. I think I have done all that I can to take responsibility to be as transparent as possibly in turning over 55,000 pages, in turning over my server and to testify on October 22, which I've been asking to do before the Congress."", 'TODD: You had said just now in one of your explanations that you provided these records because State asked of all secretaries of state. As you know there was a report earlier this week in the ""Washington Post"" that said that isn\'t quite how it happened. In the summer of 2014 they discovered the discrepancy with your records and they wanted to make a request then it became a formal request of the last four secretaries of state. Can you explain that discrepancy?', 'CLINTON: Well, we have explained that. The campaign has explained it.', 'TODD: What is it?', ""CLINTON: Look, when the committee—the eighth or ninth committee—investigating Benghazi asked for information from the State Department, they were doing a survey and they found discrepancies in their recordkeeping not in my records per se but in their overall recordkeeping. There were gaps and that's why they sent the letter and that's why we did the overall comprehensive search for everything."", ""And it got us to the same place—we looked through everything, we gave them everything work-related. In fact, we gave them so much they've already told us they're sending back 1,200 because they were clearly personal and not work related."", 'TODD: Can you respond to an alternative explanation that has sort of—', 'CLINTON: Another conspiracy theory?', 'TODD: That perhaps the reason you wanted to have a private server and not a government server is that Republicans have been coming after you for years, you might have—may have been running for president in the future and you wanted to make it a little more difficult for congressional investigators to subpoena your government e-mails and a little more difficult for Freedom of Information Act requests. Is that a fair theory or no?', ""CLINTON: It's totally ridiculous. That never crossed my mind. And in fact, since more than 90 percent of my work-related e-mails were on the system they are subject to FOIA or any other request. That's how the Benghazi Committee got the e-mails even before we went through our exhaustive process."", ""Now I have—as you're rightly pointing out—been involved from the receiving side in a lot of these accusations. In fact, as you might remember during the 90s, there were a bunch of them and, you know, all of them turned out to be not true. That was the outcome."", ""When I ran for the senate the voters of New York, they overlooked all of that, and they looked at my record, and they looked at what I would do for them and I was elected senator after going through years of this kind of back and forth. And it is regrettable but it's part of the system."", ""TODD: You know, one of the things about this over the last six months that I've heard from supporters is that there's an allegation about your e-mail server. The campaign provides an explanation, you provide an explanation. There's a new allegation, you have to provide a new explanation. There's an addendum that had explanation—it has the feel of a drip-drip-drip. Can you reassure Democrats that there's nothing else here?"", ""CLINTON: Well, it is like a drip-drip-drip and that's why I said there's only so much that I can control. But what I have tried to do in explaining this is to provide more transparency and more information than anybody that I'm aware of has ever served in the government and I'm happy to do that because I want these questions to be answered."", ""I can't predict to you what the Republicans will come up with, what kind of charges or claims they might make. I have no control over that. I can only do the best I can to try to respond."", ""The Justice Department has the e-mails, they have the server. They're conducting a security inquiry. They will take whatever necessary steps are required to get this matter resolved."", ""TODD: Can you say with 100 percent certain that the deleted e-mails that the FBI is not going to find anything in there that's going to cause you to have to explain again?"", 'CLINTON: All I can tell you is that when my attorneys conducted this exhaustive process I did not participate.', 'TODD: Why?', ""CLINTON: I didn't look at them."", ""TODD: I would want to know what e-mails. Why wouldn't you want to know?"", ""CLINTON: I wanted them to be as clear in their process as possible. I didn't want to be looking over their shoulder. If they thought it was work-related it would go to the State Department. If not then it would not. As I just said, over 1,200 of the e-mails that we were overly inclusive in trying to be comprehensive the State Department has said we don't want these. These are personal. These aren't work related. They're sending them back."", ""So when that process finished, you know, my attorney said what do you want us to do with all these personal e-mails? I said I don't need to keep them. I don't need them or want them. So they then talked to the IT server, the technical people who were responsible for maintaining them and said we don't need them anymore."", ""That's the limit of my knowledge and I know I was a little sarcastic in one exchange with the press for which I—I'm sorry guys. But you know, I'm not a technical expert. I just said I don't need them. Whatever happened to them happened to them and I'm very sure that my attorneys did the most meticulous job that could have been done."", ""TODD: I'm just curious. Would anything having to do with the Clinton Foundation, would that have been personal or work?"", 'CLINTON: Well, it would depend. I did not communicate with the foundation. Other people in the State Department did in accordance with the rules that have been adopted.', 'TODD: Any of these deleted e-mails are not going to be foundation related at all?', ""CLINTON: Well, there might be, you know, there's going to be a meeting or there's this but not anything that relates to the work of the State Department. That was handled by, you know, the professionals and others in the State Department."", ""TODD: All right. Let me sort of move on from that a little bit. I say sort of move on because obviously you've taken a hit in the polls."", 'CLINTON: I have.', ""TODD: There's the New Hampshire poll. Do you believe you have explained this and that there aren't any contradictions here? So is the issue not truthfulness but the issue of how you've handled it?"", ""CLINTON: Well, you know, let me say this Chuck. I have tried to the best of my ability to be able to respond and if people are uncertain, if they have concerns about these questions around the e-mails it's their choice to say that's going to influence, you know, how I think about the election. I understand that, I get it."", ""But I also hope people will look at my life long advocacy for kids and families and women and look at what I'm proposing, the vision I have for the country to move forward on everything from raising incomes to equal pay for equal work to getting the cost of college down to dealing with high prescription drug costs—that's what I hope people focus on and people get to make their minds up. That's the beauty of our process. People can decide on whatever basis they choose."", 'TODD: Your distrust deficit—your husband did an interview on CNN and he basically put it all on the Republicans and a little bit of us on the press that this whole thing that has driven down your poll numbers. Do you bear any responsibility?', ""CLINTON: Well, first of all, I love my husband and he does get upset when I am attacked. I totally get that. But we also get the fact that, look, this is a contest and it's fair game for people to raise whatever they choose to raise. As he said I think in that same interview, they're not giving this job away, you have to get out there, you have to earn it. And that's what I'm trying to do."", ""And of course I take responsibility. It was my choice. It was a mistake back when I did it and I'm trying to do the best I can to answer all of the questions that people have. And as I said during the 90s I was subjected to the same kind of barrage and it was—it seemed to be at the time endless."", ""And then when I ran for the Senate people said, hey, we are more concerned about what you're going to do for us. And I trust the voters to make that decision this time around, too."", ""TODD: All right. I want to play a little comp we've put together of some of the positions where your positions have changed a little bit. Take a look."", '[begin video clip]', 'CLINTON: So it is with conviction that I support this resolution as being in the best interest of our nation.', ""I've made it very clear that I made a mistake, plain and simple."", 'I believe that marriage is not just a bond but a sacred bond between a man and a woman.', 'This morning love triumphed in the highest court in our land.', ""We've not yet signed off on it but we are inclined to do so."", ""We're either going to be dependent on dirty oil from the gulf or dependent on dirty oil from Canada."", ""I oppose it. I oppose it because I don't think it's in the best interests of what we need to do to combat climate change."", '[end video clip]', ""TODD: How do you respond to some critics who say your positions have changed out of political expediency? That you're sort of whatever the majority is at that time, that's the position you have."", ""CLINTON: Well, I just don't think that reflects either my assessment of issues and I don't think it reflects how people who are thoughtful actually conduct their lives. I mean if we don't learn, if we don't, you know, make decisions based on the best information we have available, well, you know, that's regrettable. And what I've always tried to do is just say ok, what is the best decision that I can think about making?"", ""Now, with those that you did number one on the Iraq war vote, I've written about it, I've talked about it, I said it was a mistake. It certainly became a very clear mistake when you saw the way the Bush administration conducted that war and the decisions that they made. And so I have been very forthright in saying, you know, as I looked at what was happening it was a mistake."", ""On same-sex marriage, like a lot of people, including our president, I did evolve and I was not raised to even imagine this.

I did feel that I shouldn't jump in before the President and Secretary Kerry and make my views known because they're still in the middle of that process."", ""But it was frankly uncomfortable to have so many people asking me and my saying I'm waiting and waiting and waiting and it still hasn't happened. I don't know when it will happen. It may have to happen when I'm president, I hope. So I've said I'm against it on the total evaluation."", 'When I made that statement years ago we did not have the kind of energy profile we have.

He was there when it wasn't popular."", ""CLINTON: Well he can speak for himself and I certainly respect his views. I can just tell you that I am not someone who stakes out a position and holds it regardless of the evidence or regardless of the way that I perceive what's happening in the world around me."", ""As I was saying, that's where the Republicans are. They're still believing in trickle down economics even though it was a disaster not once but twice for our country.

19,            Hillary Clinton          ,"October 04, 2015","['SHARPTON: First of all, thank you for joining us. What will distinguish a Hillary Clinton presidency if elected from a Barack Obama president?', ""CLINTON: I think where we are today is due in large measure to the tough decisions that President Obama had to make. I really like to take people back through the history and point out that, when President Obama took office, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, and we could have literally fallen into a great depression, not just a great recession. And because of the hard work of the American people and the president's leadership, we got out of that big ditch. So we are standing again."", ""But now we have to build on what we've accomplished. We have to raise incomes. People are not seeing the results of that recovery in their pockets yet and that's something the president and I have talked about a lot. We have to continue and win the fight to raise the minimum wage because it's disgraceful the people that work full time in America are still in poverty.?"", ""We have to win the fight on equal pay for equal work for women. We have to incentivize more profit sharing so the productivity that leads to profitability doesn't just all show up in the paychecks of CEOs but is shared broadly. And then of course we have to continue the fight against climate change, create millions of new jobs from clean renewable energy and have an infrastructure program. I like an infrastructure bank that will put more people to work."", ""So we have a very robust agenda that builds on top of layers on top of the progress that we have made under President Obama. And the worst thing that could happen to our country, in my opinion, is for the Republicans to rip away that progress and to do a big U-turn back to trickle-down economics to slam the door in the face of hard working people, whether it's working women or minorities of any sort or the LGBT community, to basically begin to marginalize and you know, dismiss the contributions of so many of our fellow Americans."", ""SHARPTON: In 2008, president, now President Obama then senator Obama got 18 million votes. You did as well. What do you say to the eight million that didn't vote for you in 2008, why they should support Hillary Clinton now?"", ""CLINTON: Well, they are coming to me. I mean, the amount of support I have from people who supported then senator Obama in my race against him in 2008 and then others who have been supporting him ever since is really very gratifying to me. A lot of people are very appreciative of the work I did as secretary of state. They view the fact that I joined the cabinet as the senior cabinet member for my former opponent which I think is what you're supposed to do in our country was a very important statement of values about who we are and our democracy and how we get things done."", ""So I think the number of people both in my campaign and on the ground, around the country who are supporting me who were first and foremost supporters of President Obama speaks very well to their understanding of how hard this job is and how they need to elect somebody, a Democrat, who can build on the successes of the Obama presidency, and that's what I am pledged to do."", ""You know, everywhere I go to speak around the country, I talk about the mess that President Obama inherited from his Republican predecessors, not unlike although much worse than what my husband inherited from his Republican predecessors. And what I say is I'm not running for President Obama's third term or for Bill Clinton's third term. I'm running for my first term. But I know what works and I know how important it is to stand up for our values, to stand up for our interests and our security in a way that makes sense which is smart."", ""So people who have supported President Obama are, you know, very enthusiastic and I'm grateful for that in support of my candidacy."", ""SHARPTON: The debates, the democratic debates s start on the 13th. How do you distinguish yourself from your opponent its, Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley without the theatrics we've seen on the Republican side. What is the distinguishing factors that you see between you and your opponent?"", ""CLINTON: I don't think there's any comparison between, we on the Democratic side and the Republicans. All of the Democrats are saying is we want to continue to improve the lives of hard working Americans. And we have different ways of going about it, about how we want to make college affordable, how we're going to deal with the affordable care act. We have differences, and that's what the debate will be about. But what I want viewers and voters to understand is that the real challenges to the progress we've made are coming from the Republican candidates."", 'So whatever differences we have on the Democratic side, which we will be exploring in the debate to give people a chance to make up their minds among us, it is really not at all the kind of gulf between us and the Republicans.', 'SHARPTON: Any surprises that we can look for in the debate? Just between us.', ""CLINTON: Just between us, well, you know, I don't know. You never know. I'm going to start kind of getting geared up and getting prepared. There are always surprises. You never know what you're going to be asked. You know that so well. And sometimes in the heat of the moment you might not know what you're going to say, but I'm looking forward to it. I think it will be terrific for our campaign."", 'SHARPTON: There is always this looming question of whether vice president Biden is going to enter. Do you expect that he enters? And if he does, how will that, if at all, alter your strategy in terms of denomination?', ""CLINTON: You know, I have said repeatedly that this is a very hard time for the vice president for all the obvious reasons any of us can understand. And he has to have the space and time to make up his mind about what he wants to do and I respect that. I don't comment on it. I want him to do whatever he thinks is right for him and his family."", ""I'm going to run my campaign. I'm going to keep rolling out my policies. I'm going to keep standing up to the Republicans. I think they have really sort of showed their hand. They're really worried about running against me so they want to keep knocking me down. I kind of view that as a badge of respect actually, because they know that I will never give in to their, you know, very poor ideas about the economy or anything else. So I'm going to run my campaign and make my case to the American people."", 'SHARPTON: The fact that you are running and we are seeing different polls say different things, Iowa, New Hampshire, can you lose Iowa and New Hampshire and still win? Is there a path?', ""CLINTON: Well, that certainly has been the case in the past but I'm not going to lose. I'm going to work as hard as I can to make the case in the Iowa caucus and then in the New Hampshire primary. People didn't think I could win the New Hampshire primary last time after I didn't win the Iowa caucus."", ""It's very unpredictable. It is fast moving. But I think at the end of the day when I put forth, you know, my views about what the country should be doing and it is in conjunction with my experience and I think my ability, my determination, my tenacity to get things done, people will respond to that, caucus for me and vote for me."", ""SHARPTON: I'm going to say two words to you, Donald Trump. What do you think?"", '[commercial break]', ""SHARPTON: I'm going to say two words to you, Donald Trump. What do you think?"", ""CLINTON: You know, Reverend Al, he has been stalking prejudice and paranoia. He has been really appealing to the worst instincts of human nature. I think it's dangerous, his demagoguery is no longer amusing."", 'SHARPTON: He called you shrill.', ""CLINTON: Well he has called me a lot of things. Now that he's running against me. Before he called me a great senator and great secretary of state. That's what a demagogue does, right? They say whatever they need to say to try to stir up the passions of people. So I hope that he is certainly, you know, someone who people begin to evaluate more carefully, but I will add this."", 'A lot of what he has said has either been echoed or not repudiated by all of the other Republicans. He may be the flamboyant front-runner, but his views on immigration, his views on women, his views on Muslims, his views on a long list of issues are not that different from the either stated or unstated views of everybody on the Republican side.', ""SHARPTON: Jeb Bush said in addressing an issue about why there weren't a lot of blacks at a particular gathering he was addressing, and he, among other things said, they were offered free stuff by Democrats, how do you respond to that?"", ""CLINTON: You know, I find that so insulting, so demeaning and condescending, it's the kind of language we've heard not only from Jeb Bush, we heard it from Mitt Romney. We're hearing it from Donald Trump. It's insulting in the most fundamental way because when we as Democrats say, hey, we want equal pay for equal work, we want to raise the minimum wage, we want to make sure people get the best education they can, that college is affordable, that's to build people up. That's to give everybody a chance to be successful in America."", ""There's nothing free about that. That's the way we're supposed to be working in our country, where we want people to live up to the God-given potential that they have. And for Republicans to keep saying that, driving edges, dismissing the legitimate aspirations, the talent and the hard work of Americans or anybody else in our country shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what America is and should be. It needs to be rejected. I don't hear any Republicans rejecting it. But, you know, I had a Facebook Q&A a few days ago. I was just outraged about it. And I'm outraged again when you ask me."", ""SHARPTON: Let me bring you back. When you were a U.S. senator, you and I and others worked in New York around the [inaudible] case. And there are a lot of cases that has happened over the last year calling for police reform and calling for criminal justice reform. What would a president Hillary Clinton do to deal with the police reform question and to deal with the question that many of us are raising on how we have these matters looked at fairly and that families understand that they're getting a fair shot at justice?"", ""CLINTON: Absolutely. You know, first speech I gave in this campaign was at former mayor Dinkins' Colloquium at Columbia University. And I addressed systemic racism and failures of our justice system, and called for body cameras on every police officer, called for an end to mass incarceration. And I am continuing to talk about the issues. And I think that President Obama's policing commission has a good set of recommendations that I would certainly urge that we follow and implement."", ""But it's bigger than this, Al. I mean, the real problems go to how we see each other, how we treat each other, whether we're going to get back into respecting one another and that's especially true when you have police who are warrant to protect certain communities and they don't listen to those communities. They don't work with those communities."", ""Now, the communities also have to respect the police. We understand that. But the initiative needs to come from changing a lot of the incentives in policing, changing the way police officers are trained, how they work. And I think with the policing commission that President Obama commissioned, we have good ideas on all of that, that shouldn't just sit on a shelf, we should be implementing."", ""And I think that to a great extent, the movement for black lives matter has been essential in raising up these issue. A new generation has come to the forefront. I've met with some of them, I've certainly been made aware of all the meetings my staff has been having with a lot of the advocates, because we have to restore fundamental faith in our democracy and equal treatment under the law. And we know that doesn't exist right now. And that's a rebuke to all of us. And I'm going to do everything I can to restore trust and confidence and respect by changing behaviors and by holding them accountable, you know. We need to make sure that the civil rights division and the justice department is fully staffed and able to provide a clear look at any issue that needs to be referred to the federal government."", 'SHARPTON: President Clinton, former president Clinton said at the NAACP that when he did the crime bill the Omnibus crime bill that maybe things went too far. And I remember as you know I was active then, a lot of people forget a lot of us wanted something hard because of limp bias and other things that were happening, crack, I was painting crack houses if you remember trying to expose them.', 'How do we deal with violence without adding to the mass incarceration? What would be the Clinton plan? We are seeing these shootings this week in Chicago.', 'CLINTON: Right.', 'SHARPTON: I mean, we\'ve got to deal with this without feeding into where it went ""too far"" in the words of former president Clinton.', 'CLINTON: Well, both you and he are right. You remember what we were facing in the 1980s and the early 1990s. And people of color, poor communities, lots of towns and cities, including this great city of New York, were under tremendous pressure because there was so much crime, gangs were warring in the streets, crack houses were endemic, crack babies were filling, you know, the wards of our hospitals. And so yes, we did have to take action.', ""But let's remember some of the things that were done that we no longer do. We had a ban on assault weapons. I want us to get back to sensible, smart gun prevention of violence. I want us to have not just universal background checks, but I want us to really have the country rise up against the special interests lobby of the NRA that believes anybody should have a gun, regardless of their past history, regardless of whether they're domestic violence abuser."", ""This is just unsustainable, and we need to stand against it and I'm willing to take them on. Because I know that guns are at the root of so much of the crime and the danger that stalks our neighborhoods."", ""Secondly, we do have to weed out the most violent offenders, you know, the repeat offenders, the guys who have no regard for human life. But our prisons and jails are filled with people who have mental health challenges, people who have substance abuse challenges. They should not be in jail or prison. I want a much more robust diversionary program. I want us to do more on treatment. I think I may be the first presidential candidate at least in a long time who has a whole policy on substance abuse because this is at the root, you know. And so many people with anxiety, with depression, with other mental health problems, they self-medicate with alcohol and drugs, and oftentimes they get off track. We shouldn't punish them. We should help them."", 'I also think that the police have to understand that a lot of what we tried to do back in the day, back in the 1990s and the Clinton administration was to build those relationships between police and community, not to be in two separate camps but to be part of the same effort, to protect citizens, particularly the elderly, particularly the young, to have enough policing that people could feel safe, but not so much that it oppresses people and makes them feel that they are being singled out.', ""This is a hard path to walk, but I know we can do it. We've learned lessons. We have a lot that we now know especially when it comes to imprisoning low level offenders is not necessary to prevent crime on the streets. Let's focus on the bad actors that we don't want setting up crack houses again that you have to go and try to close or joining gangs that are so deadly people are dying across the streets in the country."", 'SHARPTON: Secretary Clinton, thank you so much for being with us this morning.', 'CLINTON: That went by fast.

I will do my best to answer their questions.

And that is, why did the State Department deny all those security requests?"", 'The former regional security officer in Libya, Eric Nordstrom recalled in testimony asking for 12 new security agents.

Why weren't the security requests, why weren't they made?"", ""CLINTON: Well, that was left to the security professionals, Jake. And in the reports, the ones that have been done that were nonpolitical and independent in their efforts to try to sort this through, I think concluded that the security professionals in the State Department had to look worldwide and had to make some tough decisions. That's why we don't inject politics into it. That has to be what the professionals are deciding."", ""And there were a lot of different opinions and that's understandable. There's tough decisions that have to be made."", ""So, I can only point you to the very thorough review that several committees have done starting with the accountability review board that have gone into this in great detail and made recommendations about how we can better make those assessments. Not at the political level, because I don't think a secretary of state who may be there for four years or two years should be reaching down in and making those decisions. But we have to do a better job with the professionals charged with making the decisions so that the information can all be evaluated and the resources that are needed can be asked for and deployed to the best extent."", 'TAPPER: I know Bernie Sanders said that, quote, ""the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails.""

With all your experience, why wouldn't you anticipate that over the course of four years, handling very sensitive diplomatic negotiations, overseeing military interventions and surveillance, why wouldn't you anticipate that something classified, whether about North Korea or Iran or drones or an informant for the CIA, that it wouldn't be e-mailed to you? And why wouldn't you consider that having it on your personal account with some server in Colorado might be a potential risk?"", 'CLINTON: Well, first of all, nothing—and I will underscore, nothing that I was sent or that I sent was marked classified. We have a system in our government, in our State Department, it was there before I came in.', 'TAPPER: Right.', 'CLINTON: It has continued after I left where there are decisions made about what is classified information in real time. And nothing was marked classified.', 'TAPPER: The inspector general of the intelligence community said some of this stuff contained classified information when it was generated whether or not it was marked classified.', 'CLINTON: Well, that is just a very strong difference of opinion. The State Department does not agree with that. And it is almost an impossible standard because we had two separate systems.', 'We had the unclassified system, so anybody on the unclassified system with the State Department would only be able to tell if something were classified if it were marked classified. We dealt with classified information on a totally different system. Nobody had access to that from an unclassified device.', 'So, I think a lot of this is being a public display of the very common arguments that go on between different agencies in our government. This happens every time there is a Freedom of Information Act request.', ""If something's going to be made public that was not classified at the time, maybe something has happened years later that there's a case and so now, it's sensitive information."", ""That's what's going on here. Different agencies are weighing in saying, yes, it wasn't classified, but we think that there is something in it that now we're going to say is sensitive. At the time there was nothing marked classified. And that is the fact that hasn't changed."", 'TAPPER: Right. And you said it was allowed too.', 'CLINTON: Yes, it was.', 'TAPPER: Who allowed it?', 'CLINTON: It was allowed under the rules of State Department. Again—', 'TAPPER: So nobody signed off on it?', 'CLINTON: No, no, it was allowed. You know, one of my predecessors did the same thing. Others in our government have done the same thing at very high levels, because the rules did change after I left State Department. But at the time and in prior years, the rules allowed it.', 'TAPPER: But it never occurred to you when any of these e-mails coming in from Sid Blumenthal with very sensitive information—', 'CLINTON: Sid Blumenthal was not a government employee or official. It would be like you sending me something, Jake. If I thought it had some interest to it, I might forward it onto somebody.', ""But I would not expect you to be in a position to classify anything because you were not in that classification process. Neither was he. So, he sent me stuff that he heard from people. You know, he's an old journalist and thought it was of interest. Some of it I sent on, some I didn't. I kind of made the judgment at the time."", 'It was not in the category of anything that could be classified because it came from an outside nongovernment person passing on what somebody told somebody told him.', ""And, look, I'm somebody who thinks the government and people who work in it should be open to getting information from different sources. I mean, you wrote a book about Afghanistan. If during the course of my being secretary of state, you had sent me an e-mail saying, look, I think the government needs to know this, and I thought, hey, that's a good point I'll send it on and six years later they say, oh, my gosh, he was reporting sensitive information. Well, you didn't know that. And I certainly didn't know that."", 'So, I think that this is a complicated issue for even sophisticated folks to understand. And I just keep going back to we have two different systems. I dealt with classified information very carefully and seriously.', ""I usually met with people to discuss it. It was delivered to me in hard copy so marked. And then when I traveled, I had one of those tents because we were afraid of prying eyes from certain governments that I would read classified material in. So, I'm very familiar with the importance of treating classified information as it should be with great care."", 'TAPPER: Can I get your e-mail address?', 'CLINTON: Sure. You want to send me something that might be interesting?', ""TAPPER: I'm just wondering for the future. I haven't had that kind of relationship with you, but if that was like a hidden offer."", 'CLINTON: Yes, sure. You can give me, you know, what you hear politically. I might make use of it.', 'TAPPER: Sure. Madam Secretary, thanks so much for your time. I really appreciate it.', 'CLINTON: Great. Nice to talk to you.', 'TAPPER: Congratulations on the debate.', 'CLINTON: Tank you. Thank you very much.']"

Not at the political level, because I don't think a secretary of state who may be there for four years or two years should be reaching down in and making those decisions, but we have to do a better job with the professionals charged with making the decisions so that the information can all be evaluated and the resources that are need can be asked for and deployed to the best extent."", 'TAPPER: I know Bernie Sanders said that, quote, ""the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails."" But there are a lot of people who are not...', 'CLINTON: Well—', ""TAPPER: ... including FBI officials looking into whether national security was comprised because of this server. And this is—this is something else that is very confusing to me with all your experience why wouldn't you anticipate that over the course of four years handling very sensitive diplomatic negotiations, overseeing military interventions and surveillance why wouldn't you anticipate that something classified whether about North Korea, or Iran, or drones or an informant for the CIA that it—that it wouldn't be e-mailed to you? And why wouldn't you consider that having it on your personal account with some server in Colorado might be a potential risk?"", 'CLINTON: Well, first of all, nothing and I will underscore nothing that I was sent or that I sent was marked classified.', 'We have a system in our government, in our State Department. It was there before I came in.', 'TAPPER: Right.', 'CLINTON: It has continued after I left where there are decisions made about what is classified information in real time and nothing was marked classified.', 'TAPPER: The inspector general of the intelligence community said some of this stuff contained classified information when it was generated whether or not it was marked classify.', 'CLINTON: Well, that is just a very strong difference of opinion. The State Department does not agree with that. And it is almost an impossible standard because we had two separate systems.', ""We had the unclassified systems, so anybody who was on the unclassified system with the State Department would only be able to tell if something were classified if it were marked classified. We dealt with classified information on a totally different system. Nobody had access to that from an unclassified device. So, I think a lot of this is being a public display of the very common arguments that go on between different agencies and our government. This happens every time there is a Freedom of Information Act request. If something is going to be made public that was not classified at the time, maybe something has happened years later that there's a case and so now it's sensitive information. That's what's going on here. Different agencies are weighing in and saying, yes, it wasn't classified but we think that there is something in it that now we're going to say is sensitive."", ""You know, at the time there was nothing marked classified. And that is the fact that hasn't changed ever since—"", 'TAPPER: Right. And you said it was allowed, too.', 'CLINTON: Yes, it was.', 'TAPPER: Who allowed it?', 'CLINTON: It was allowed under the rules of the State Department. And again—', 'TAPPER: So nobody signed off on it?', 'CLINTON: No, no. It was allowed.', 'You know, one of my predecessors did the same thing. Others in our government have done the same thing at very high levels because the rules did change after I left the State Department. But at the time and in prior years the rules allowed it.']"
22,            Hillary Clinton          ,"October 22, 2015","['Thank you Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Cummings, members of the committee. The terrorist attacks at our diplomatic compound and later, at the CIA post in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012 took the lives of four brave Americans: Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods.\n', 'I am here to honor the service of those four men, the courage of the Diplomatic Security agency and the CIA officers who risked their lives that night, and the work their colleagues do every single day all over the world.\n', ""I knew and admired Chris Stevens. He was one of our nation's most accomplished diplomats. Chris's mother liked to say that he had sand in his shoes, because he was always moving, always working, especially in the Middle East that he came to know so well.\n"", 'When the revolution broke out in Libya, we named Chris as our envoy to the opposition. There was no easy way to get him into Benghazi to begin gathering information and meeting those Libyans who were rising up against the murderous the dictator Qadhafi, but he found a way to get himself there on a Greek cargo ship, just like a 19th century American envoy. But his work was very much 21st century hard-nosed diplomacy.\n', 'It is a testament to the relationships that he built in Libya that on the day following the awareness of his death, tens of thousands of Libyans poured into the streets in Benghazi. They held signs reading ""thugs don\'t represent Benghazi or Islam."" ""Sorry people of America, this is not the behavior of our Islam or our Prophet."" ""Chris Stevens, a friend to all Libyans.""\n', ""Although I didn't have the privilege of meeting Sean Smith personally, he was a valued member of our State Department family. An Air Force veteran, he was an Information Management officer, who had served in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague.\n"", ""Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty worked for the CIA. They were killed by mortar fire at the CIA's outpost in Benghazi, a short distance from the diplomatic compound. They were both former Navy SEALs and trained paramedics with distinguished records of service, including in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n"", 'As Secretary of State, I had the honor to lead and the responsibility to support nearly 70,000 diplomats and development experts across the globe.\n', 'Losing any one of them, as we did in Iraq, Afghanistan, Mexico, Haiti, and Libya during my tenure, was deeply painful for our entire State Department and USAID family, and for me personally.\n', 'I was the one who asked Chris to go to Libya as our envoy. I was the one who recommended him to be our Ambassador to to the President.\n', 'After the attacks, I stood next to President Obama as Marines carried his casket and those of the other three Americans off the plane at Andrews Air Force Base.\n', 'I took responsibility. And, as part of that, before I left office, I launched reforms to better protect our people in the field and help reduce the chance of another tragedy happening in the future.\n', 'What happened in Benghazi has been scrutinized by a nonpartisan, hard-hitting Accountability Review Board, seven prior Congressional investigations, multiple news organizations, and, of course, our law enforcement and intelligence agencies.\n', 'So today I would like to share three observations about how we can learn from this tragedy and move forward as a nation.\n', 'First, America must lead in a dangerous world, and our diplomats must continue representing us in dangerous places.\n', 'The State Department sends people to more than 270 posts in 170 countries around the world.\n', 'Chris Stevens understood that diplomats must operate in many places where our soldiers do not, where there are no other boots on the ground, and safety is far from guaranteed. In fact, he volunteered for just those assignments.\n', 'He also understood we will never prevent every act of terrorism or achieve perfect security, and that we inevitably must accept a level of risk to protect our country and advance our interests and values.\n', 'And make no mistake: the risks are real. Terrorists have killed more than sixty-five American diplomatic personnel since the 1970s and more than a hundred contractors and locally employed staff.\n', 'Since 2001, there have been more than one hundred attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities around the world.\n', ""But if you ask our most experienced ambassadors, they'll tell you they can't do their jobs for us from bunkers.\n"", ""It would compound the tragedy of Benghazi if Chris Stevens' death and the death of the other three Americans ended up undermining the work to which he and they devoted their lives.\n"", 'We have learned the hard way when America is absent, especially from unstable places, there are consequences. Extremism takes root, aggressors seek to fill the vacuum, and security everywhere is threatened, including here at home.\n', ""That's why Chris was in Benghazi. It's why he had served previously in Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jerusalem during the second intifada.\n"", 'Nobody knew the dangers of Libya better – a weak government, extremist groups, rampant instability. But Chris chose to go to Benghazi because he understood America had to be represented there at that pivotal time.\n', ""He knew that eastern Libya was where the revolution had begun and that unrest there could derail the country's fragile transition to democracy. And if extremists gained a foothold, they would have the chance to destabilize the entire region, including Egypt and Tunisia.\n"", ""He also knew how urgent it was to ensure that the weapons Qadhafi had left strewn across the country, including shoulder-fired missiles that could knock an airplane out of the sky, did not fall into the wrong hands. The nearest Israeli airport is just a day's drive from the Libyan border.\n"", ""Above all, Chris understood that most people, in Libya or anywhere, reject the extremists' argument that violence can ever be a path to dignity or justice. That's what those thousands of Libyans were saying after they learned of his death. He understood there was no substitute for going beyond the Embassy walls and doing the hard work of building relationships.\n"", ""Retreat from the world is not an option. America cannot shrink from our responsibility to lead. That doesn't mean we should ever return to the go-it-alone foreign policy of the past, a foreign policy that puts boots on the ground as a first choice rather than a last resort. Quite the opposite.\n"", ""We need creative, confident leadership that harnesses all of America's strengths and values. Leadership that integrates and balances the tools of diplomacy, development, and defense.\n"", 'And at the heart of that effort must be dedicated professionals like Chris Stevens and his colleagues, who put their lives on the line for a country—our country—because they believed – as I do – that America is the greatest force for peace and progress the world has ever known.\n', 'My second observation is this: We have a responsibility to provide our diplomats with the resources and support they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible.\n', ""After previous deadly attacks, leaders from both parties and both branches of government came together to determine what went wrong and how to fix it for the future. That's what happened during the Reagan administration, when Hezbollah attacked our embassy. They killed 63 people, including 17 Americans. And then in a later attack, attacked our Marine barracks and killed so many more. Those two attacks in Beirut resulted in the deaths of 258 Americans.\n"", ""It's what happened during the Clinton administration when al Qaeda bombed our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing more than two hundred people, wounding more than two thousand people, and killing twelve Americans. It's what happened during the Bush administration after 9/11.\n"", ""Part of America's strength is we learn, we adapt, and we get stronger.\n"", 'After the Benghazi attacks, I asked Ambassador Thomas Pickering, one of our most distinguished and longest-serving diplomats, along with Admiral Mike Mullen, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appointed by President George W. Bush, to lead an Accountability Review Board. This is an institution that the Congress set up after the terrible attacks in Beirut. There have been eighteen previous Accountability Review Boards. Only two have ever made any of their findings public. The one following the attacks on our embassies in East Africa and the one following the attack on Benghazi. The Accountability Review Board did not pull a single punch. They found systemic problems and management deficiencies in two State Department bureaus.\n', 'And the Review Board recommended twenty-nine specific improvements. I pledged that by the time I left office, every one would be on the way to implementation. And they were. More Marines were slated for deployment to high-threat embassies. Additional Diplomatic Security agents were being hired and trained.\n', 'And Secretary Kerry has continued this work. But there is more to do. And no administration can do it alone. Congress has to be our partner, as it has been after previous tragedies.\n', 'For example, the Accountability Review Board and subsequent investigations have recommended improved training for our officers before they deploy to the field. But efforts to establish a modern joint training center are being held up by Congress. The men and women who serve our country deserve better.\n', ""Finally, there is one more observation I'd like to share:\n"", 'I traveled to 112 countries as Secretary of State. Every time I did, I felt great pride and honor representing the country that I love. We need leadership at home to match our leadership abroad. Leadership that puts national security ahead of politics and ideology.\n', 'Our nation has a long history of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy and national security. Not that we always agree — far from it — but we do come together when it counts.\n', 'As Secretary of State, I worked with the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to pass a landmark nuclear arms control treaty with Russia. I worked with Republican Leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, to open up Burma, now Myanmar, to find democratic change.\n', ""I know it's possible to find common ground, because I have done it.\n"", 'We should debate on the basis of fact, not fear. We should resist denigrating the patriotism or loyalty of those with who we disagree.\n', 'So I am here. Despite all the previous investigations and all the talk about partisan agendas, I am here to honor those we lost and to do what I can to aid those who serve us still.\n', 'And my challenge to you, members of this Committee, is the same challenge I put to myself.\n', ""Let's be worthy of the trust the American people have bestowed upon us. They expect us to lead. To learn the right lessons. To rise above partisanship and to reach for statesmanship.\n"", ""That's what I tried to do every day as Secretary of State. And it's what I hope we all strive for here today and into the future. Thank you.""]"
23,            Hillary Clinton          ,"November 19, 2015","['CLINTON: Thank you. Thank you very much. [applause]', 'Thank you, Richard. And thanks for the great work that the council does under your leadership. It truly is an important resource for us all.', ""Fareed, I look forward to having the conversation with you, everyone here at the council, and Mr. Mayor. Thank you very much for being here and for everything you are doing and will do to keep our city safe and strong. I'm very grateful."", 'I wanted to come here to our city, which has shown such resilience in the face of terrorism, to talk about the events of the past week, and the work we must do together to protect our country and our friends.', ""When the United States was hit on 9/11, our allies treated that attack against one as an attack against all. Now, it's our turn to stand in solidarity with France and all of our friends. We cherish the same values. We face the same adversaries. We must share the same determination."", ""After a major terrorist attack, every society faces a choice between fear and resolve. The world's great democracies can't sacrifice our values or turn our backs on those in need. Therefore, we must choose resolve. And we must lead the world to meet this threat."", ""Now, let's be clear about what we're facing. Beyond Paris in recent days, we've seen deadly terrorist attacks in Nigeria, Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey, and a Russian civilian airline destroyed over the Sinai. At the heart of today's new landscape of terror is ISIS. They persecute religious and ethnic minorities; kidnap and behead civilians; murder children. They systematically enslave, torture and rape women and girls."", 'ISIS operates across three mutually reinforcing dimensions: a physical enclave in Iraq and Syria; an international terrorist network that includes affiliates across the region and beyond; and an ideological movement of radical jihadism. We have to target and defeat all three, and time is of the essence.', ""ISIS is demonstrating new ambition, reach and capabilities. We have to break the group's momentum and then its back. Our goal is not to deter or contain ISIS, but to defeat and destroy ISIS."", ""But we have learned that we can score victories over terrorist leaders and networks, only to face metastasizing threats down the road, so we also have to play and win the long game. We should pursue a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy, one that embeds our mission against ISIS within a broader struggle against radical jihadism that is bigger than any one group, whether it's Al Qaida or ISIS or some other network."", 'An immediate war against an urgent enemy and a generational struggle against an ideology with deep roots will not be easily torn out. It will require sustained commitment in every pillar of American power. This is a worldwide fight, and American must lead it.', 'Our strategy should have three main elements. One, defeat ISIS in Syria, Iraq and across the Middle East; two, disrupt and dismantle the growing terrorist infrastructure that facilitates the flow of fighters, financing arms and propaganda around the world; three, harden our defenses and those of our allies against external and homegrown threats.', ""Let me start with the campaign to defeat ISIS across the region. The United States and our international coalition has been conducting this fight for more than a year. It's time to begin a new phase and intensify and broaden our efforts to smash the would-be caliphate and deny ISIS control of territory in Iraq and Syria. That starts with a more effective coalition air campaign, with more allied planes, more strikes and a broader target set."", ""A key obstacle standing in the way is a shortage of good intelligence about ISIS and its operations, so we need an immediate intelligence surge in the region, including technical assets, Arabic speakers with deep expertise in the Middle East and even closer partnership with regional intelligence services. Our goal should be to achieve the kind of penetration we accomplished with Al Qaida in the past. This would help us identify and eliminate ISIS' command and control and its economic lifelines."", ""A more effective coalition air campaign is necessary, but not sufficient, and we should be honest about the fact that to be successful, airstrikes will have to be combined with ground forces actually taking back more territory from ISIS. Like President Obama, I do not believe that we should again have 100,000 American troops in combat in the Middle East. That is just not the smart move to make here. If we have learned anything from 15 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, it's that local people and nations have to secure their own communities. We can help them, and we should, but we cannot substitute for them. But we can and should support local and regional ground forces in carrying out this mission."", ""Now, the obstacles to achieving this are significant. On the Iraqi side of the border, Kurdish forces have fought bravely to defend their own lands and to re-take towns from ISIS, but the Iraqi national army has struggled, and it's going to take more work to get it up to fighting shape. As part of that process, we may have to give our own troops advising and training the Iraqis greater freedom of movement and flexibility, including embedding in local units and helping target airstrikes."", ""Ultimately, however, a ground campaign in Iraq will only succeed if more Iraqi Sunnis join the fight. But that won't happen so long as they do not feel they have a stake in their country or confidence in their own security and capacity to confront ISIS."", ""Now, we've been in a similar place before in Iraq. In the first Sunni awakening in 2007, we were able to provide sufficient support and assurances to the Sunni tribes to persuade them to join us in rooting out Al Qaida. Unfortunately, under Prime Minister Maliki's rule, those tribes were betrayed and forgotten."", ""So the task of bringing Sunnis off the sidelines into this new fight will be considerably more difficult. But nonetheless, we need to lay the foundation for a second Sunni awakening. We need to put sustained pressure on the government in Baghdad to get its political house in order, move forward with national reconciliation, and finally stand up a national guard. Baghdad needs to accept, even embrace, arming Sunni and Kurdish forces in the war against ISIS. But if Baghdad won't do that, the coalition should do so directly."", 'On the Syrian side, the big obstacle to getting more ground forces to engage ISIS, beyond the Syrian Kurds who are already deep in the fight, is that the viable Sunni opposition groups remain understandably preoccupied with fighting Assad who, let us remember, has killed many more Syrians than the terrorists have. But they are increasingly under threat from ISIS as well.', 'So we need to move simultaneously toward a political solution to the civil war that paves the way for a new government with new leadership, and to encourage more Syrians to take on ISIS as well. To support them, we should immediately deploy the special operations force President Obama has already authorized, and be prepared to deploy more as more Syrians get into the fight. And we should retool and ramp up our efforts to support and equip viable Syrian opposition units.', 'Our increased support should go hand in hand with increased support from our Arab and European partners, including special forces who can contribute to the fight on the ground. We should also work with the coalition and the neighbors to impose no-fly zones that will stop Assad from slaughtering civilians and the opposition from the air. Opposition forces on the ground, with material support from the coalition, could then help create safe areas where Syrians could remain in the country, rather than fleeing toward Europe.', 'This combined approach would help enable the opposition to retake the remaining stretch of the Turkish border from ISIS, choking off its supply lines. It would also give us new leverage in the diplomatic process that Secretary Kerry is pursuing.', ""Of course, we've been down plenty of diplomatic dead-ends before in this conflict. But we have models for how seemingly intractable multi-sectarian civil wars do eventually end. We can learn lessons from Lebanon and Bosnia about what it will take. And Russia and Iran have to face the fact that continuing to prop up a vicious dictator will not bring stability."", ""Right now, I'm afraid, President Putin is actually making things somewhat worse."", 'Now, to be clear, though, there is an important role for Russia to help in resolving the conflict in Syria. And we have indicated a willingness to work with them toward an outcome that preserves Syria as a unitary, nonsectarian state, with protections for the rights of all Syrians and to keep key state institutions intact.', ""There is no alternative to a political transition that allows Syrians to end Assad's rule."", 'Now, much of this strategy on both sides of the border hinges on the roles of our Arab and Turkish partners. And we must get them to carry their share of the burden, with military intelligence and financial contributions, as well as using their influence with fighters and tribes in Iraq and Syria.', 'Countries like Jordan have offered more, and we should take them up on it, because ultimately our efforts will only succeed if the Arabs and Turks step up in a much bigger way. This is their fight and they need to act like it.', 'So far, however, Turkey has been more focused on the Kurds than on countering ISIS. And to be fair, Turkey has a long and painful history with Kurdish terrorist groups. But the threat from ISIS cannot wait. As difficult as it may be, we need to get Turkey to stop bombing Kurdish fighters in Syria who are battling ISIS, and become a full partner in our coalition efforts against ISIS.', ""The United States should also work with our Arab partners to get them more invested in the fight against ISIS. At the moment, they're focused in other areas because of their concerns in the region, especially the threat from Iran. That's why the Saudis, for example, shifted attention from Syria to Yemen. So we have to work out a common approach."", 'In September, I laid out a comprehensive plan to counter Iranian influence across the region and its support for terrorist proxies such as Hezbollah and Hamas. We cannot view Iran and ISIS as separate challenges. Regional politics are too interwoven. Raising the confidence of our Arab partners and raising the costs to Iran for bad behavior will contribute to a more effective fight against ISIS.', 'And as we work out a broader regional approach, we should, of course, be closely consulting with Israel, our strongest ally in the Middle East. Israel increasingly shares with our Arab partners and has the opportunity to do more in intelligence and joint efforts as well.', ""Now, we should have no illusions about how difficult the mission before us really is. We have to fit a lot of pieces together, bring along a lot of partners, move on multiple fronts at once. But if we press forward on both sides of the border, in the air and on the ground, as well as diplomatically, I do believe we can crush ISIS's enclave of terror."", 'And to support this campaign, Congress should swiftly pass an updated authorization to use military force. That will send a message to friend and foe alike that the United States is committed to this fight. The time for delay is over. We should get this done.', 'Now, the second element of our strategy looks beyond the immediate battlefield of Iraq and Syria, to disrupt and dismantle global terrorist infrastructure on the ground and online.', 'A terror pipeline that facilitates the flow of fighters, financing, arms and propaganda around the world has allowed ISIS to strike at the heart of Paris last week and an Al Qaida affiliate to do the same at Charlie Hebdo earlier this year. ISIS is working hard to extend its reach, establish affiliates and cells far from its home base, and despite the significant setbacks it has encountered, not just with ISIS and its ambitious plans, but even Al Qaida, including the death of Osama bin Laden, they are still posing great threats to so many.', ""Let's take one example. We've had a lot of conversation about ISIS in the last week, let's not forget Al Qaida. They still have the most sophisticated bombmakers, ambitious plotters and active affiliates in places like Yemen and North Africa, so we can't just focus on Iraq and Syria, we need to intensify our counter—our counterterrorism efforts on a wider scope."", 'Most urgent is stopping the flow of foreign fighters to and from the war zones of the Middle East. Thousands—thousands of young recruits have flocked to Syria from France, Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom and, yes, even the United States. Their western passports make it easier for them to cross borders and eventually return home radicalized and battle hardened. Stemming this tide will require much better coordination and information-sharing among countries every step of the way. We should not stop pressing until Turkey, where most foreign fighters cross into Syria, finally locks down its border.', 'The United States and our allies need to know and share the identities of every fighter who has traveled to Syria. We also have to be smart and target interventions that will have the greatest impact. For example, we need a greater focus on shutting down key enablers who arrange transportation, documents and more.', 'When it comes to terrorist financing, we have to go after the nodes that facilitate illicit trade and transactions. The U.N. Security Council should update its terrorism sanctions. They have a resolution that does try to block terrorist financing and other enabling activities, but we have to place more obligations on countries to police their own banks, and the United States, which has quite a record of success in this area, can share more intelligence to help other countries. And once and for all, the Saudis, the Qataris and others need to stop their citizens from directly funding extremist organizations as well as the schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path to radicalization. When it comes to blocking terrorist recruitment, we have to identify the hotspots, the specific neighborhoods and villages, the prisons and schools where recruitment happens in clusters, like the neighborhood in Brussels where the Paris attacks were planned. Through partnerships with local law enforcement and civil society, especially with Muslim community leaders, we have to work to tip the balance away from extremism in these hotspots.', ""Radicalization and recruitment also is happening online. There's no doubt we have to do a better job contesting online space, including websites and chat rooms where jihadists communicate with followers. We must deny them virtual territory just as we deny them actual territory."", 'At the State Department, I built up a unit of communication specialists fluent in Urdu, Arabic, Somali and other languages to battle with extremists online.', ""We need more of that, including from the private sector. Social media companies can also do their part by swiftly shutting down terrorist accounts, so they're not used to plan, provoke or celebrate violence."", ""Online or off-line, the bottom line is that we are in a contest of ideas against an ideology of hate, and we have to win. Let's be clear, though, Islam is not our adversary. Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism. The obsession in some quarters with a clash of civilization, or repeating the specific words radical Islamic terrorism isn't just a distraction, it gives these criminals, these murderers more standing than they deserve. It actually plays into their hands by alienating partners we need by our side."", ""Our priority should be how to fight the enemy. In the end, it didn't matter what kind of terrorist we call bin Laden, it mattered that we killed bin Laden. But we still can't close our eyes to the fact that there is a distorted and dangerous stream of extremism within the Muslim world that continues to spread. Its adherents are relatively few in number, but capable of causing profound damage, most especially to their own communities throughout an arc of instability that stretches from North and West Africa to Asia."", 'Overlapping conflicts, collapsing state structures, widespread corruption, poverty and repression have created openings for extremists to exploit.', ""Before the Arab Spring, I warned that the region's foundations would sink into the sand without immediate reforms. Well, the need has only grown more urgent. We have to join with our partners to do the patient's steady work of empowering moderates and marginalizing extremists; supporting democratic institutions and the rule of law; creating economic growth that supports stability; working to curb corruption, helping training effective and accountable law enforcement, intelligence and counterterrorism services. As we do this, we must be building up a global counterterrorism infrastructure that is more active and adaptable than the terror networks we're trying to defeat."", 'When I became secretary of State, I was surprised to find that nearly a decade after 9/11, there was still no dedicated international vehicle to regularly convene key countries to deal with terrorist threats.', 'So, we created the Global Counterterrorism Forum, which now brings together nearly 30 countries, many from the Muslim world. It should be a clearing house for directing assistance to countries that need it, for mobilizing common action against threats.', ""And let's not lose sight of the global cooperation needed to lock down loose nuclear material and chemical and biological weapons, and keep them out of the hands of terrorists."", 'At the end of the day, we still must be prepared to go after terrorists wherever they plot using all the tools at our disposal, that includes targeted strikes by U.S. military aircraft and drones, with proper safeguards when there are any other viable options to deal with continuing imminent threats.', 'All of this—stopping foreign fighters, blocking terrorist financing, doing battle in cyberspace—is vital to the war against ISIS, but it also lays the foundation for defusing and defeating the next threat and the one after that.', 'Now, the third element of our strategy has to be hardening our defenses at home and helping our partners do the same against both external and home-grown threats. After 9/11, the United States made a lot of progress breaking down bureaucratic barriers to allow for more and better information sharing among agencies responsible for keeping us safe.', ""We still have work to do on this front, but by comparison, Europe is way behind. Today, European nations don't even always alert each other when they turn away a suspected jihadist at the border, or when a passport is stolen. It seems like after most terrorist attacks, we find out that the perpetrators were known to some security service or another, but too often the dots never get connected."", 'I appreciate how hard this is, especially given the sheer number of suspects and threats, but this has to change. The United States must work with Europe to dramatically and immediately improve intelligence sharing and counterterrorism coordination. European countries also should have the flexibility to enhance their border controls when circumstances warrant.', 'And here at home, we face a number of our own challenges. The threat to airline security is evolving as terrorists develop new devices like nonmetallic bombs. So our defenses have to stay at least one step ahead. We know that intelligence gathered and shared by local law enforcement officers is absolutely critical to breaking up plots and preventing attacks. So they need all the resources and support we can give them.', 'Law enforcement also needs the trust of residents and communities, including in our own country Muslim Americans. Now, this should go without saying, but in the current climate, it bears repeating. Muslim Americans are working every day on the front lines of the fight against radicalization.', 'Another challenge is how to strike the right balance of protecting privacy and security. Encryption of mobile communications presents a particularly tough problem. We should take the concerns of law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals seriously. They have warned that impenetrable encryption may prevent them from accessing terrorist communications and preventing a future attack. On the other hand, we know there are legitimate concerns about government intrusion, network security, and creating new vulnerabilities that bad actors can and would exploit. So we need Silicon Valley not to view government as its adversary. We need to challenge our best minds in the private sector to work with our best minds in the public sector to develop solutions that will both keep us safe and protect our privacy.', 'Now is the time to solve this problem, not after the next attack.', 'Since Paris, no homeland security challenge is being more hotly debated than how to handle Syrian refugees seeking safety in the United States. Our highest priority, of course, must always be protecting the American people. So yes, we do need to be vigilant in screening and vetting any refugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security professionals, in close coordination with our allies and partners.', 'And Congress need to make sure the necessary resources are provided for comprehensive background checks, drawing on the best intelligence we can get. And we should be taking a close look at the safeguards in the visa programs as well, but we cannot allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values and our humanitarian obligations. Turning away orphans, applying a religious test, discriminating against Muslims, slamming the door on every Syrian refugee, that is just not who we are. We are better than that.', 'And remember, many of these refugees are fleeing the same terrorists who threaten us. It would be a cruel irony indeed if ISIS can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from ever finding new ones. We should be doing more to ease this humanitarian crisis, not less. We should lead the international community in organizing a donor conference and supporting countries like Jordan who are sheltering the majority of refugees fleeing Syria.', ""And we can get this right. America's open, free, tolerant society is described by some as a vulnerability in the struggle against terrorism, but I actually believe it's one of our strengths. It reduces the appeal of radicalism and enhances the richness and resilience of our communities. This is not a time for scoring political points."", ""When New York was attacked on 9/11, we had a Republican president, a Republican governor and a Republican mayor, and I worked with all of them. We pulled together and put partisanship aside to rebuild our city and protect our country. This is a time for American leadership. No other country can rally the world to defeat ISIS and win the generational struggle against radical jihadism. Only the United States can mobilize common action on a global scale, and that's exactly what we need. The entire world must be part of this fight, but we must lead it."", ""There's been a lot of talk lately about coalitions. Everyone seems to want one, but there's not nearly as much talk about what it actually takes to make a coalition work in the heat and pressure of an international crisis. I know how hard this is because we've done it before. To impose the toughest sanctions in history on Iran, to stop a dictator from slaughtering his people in Libya, to support a fledgling democracy in Afghanistan, we have to use every pillar of American power—military and diplomacy, development and economic and cultural influence, technology and maybe most importantly our values. That is smart power."", 'We have to work with institutions and partners like NATO, the E.U., the Arab League and the U.N., strengthen our alliances and never get tired of old-fashioned shoe leather diplomacy, and if necessary be prepared to act decisively on our own, just as we did it to bring Osama bin Laden to justice.', 'The United States and our allies must demonstrate that free people and free markets are still the hope of humanity. This past week, as I watched the tragic scenes from France, I kept thinking back to a young man in the world met in January after the last attack in Paris. His name was Lassana, a Muslim immigrant from Mali who worked at a kosher market. He said the market had become a new home and his colleagues and customers a second family.', 'When the terrorist arrived and the gunfire began, Lassana risked his life to protect his Jewish customers. He moved quickly, hiding as many people as he could in the cold storage room, and then slipping out to help the police.', '""I didn\'t know or care, he said, if they were Jews or Christians or Muslims. We\'re all in the same boat."" What a rebuke to the extremists\' hatred.', 'The French government announced it would grant Lassana full citizenship. But when it mattered most, he proved he was a citizen already.', ""That's the power of free people. That's what the jihadis will never understand and never defeat. And as we meet here today, let us resolve that we will go forward together, and we will do all we can to lead the world against this threat that threatens people everywhere."", 'Thank you all. [applause]', 'QUESTION: Thank you so much, Madam Secretary, and thanks to Richard Haass again, for organizing this extraordinary opportunity.', 'In the week of the Paris attacks, President Obama said that he thought what was needed now was an intensification of his existing strategy against ISIS.', ""Is what you're proposing an intensification of the existing strategy, or a change to it?"", 'CLINTON: Well, as I said in the speech, it is, in many ways, an intensification, an acceleration of the strategy. But it has to also intensify and accelerate our efforts in the other arenas.', 'What we have done with airstrikes has made a difference, but now it needs to make a greater difference and we need more of a coalition, you know, flying those missions with us.', ""What we have done, with the president saying there would be special forces sent, it is right in line with what I think that they need to get there, and we need to take stock of whether we need more, and we need to also empower our trainers in Iraq to have more support to do what they're trying to accomplish by getting the Iraqi Army, once again, to be a fighting force."", ""And we need—one thing that I believe we haven't done yet is make it clear to Baghdad that we are going to be arming Sunni tribes and Kurds if they don't, because at some point, they have to be in the fight. The Kurds, as you know, are fighting bravely on both sides of the border, and they need the support that we've given them and some of the special ops work, and the assault and taking back of Sinjar."", 'And then, these other two elements that I mentioned. We have pieces in place, but I think we have to deepen and better coordinate, not only within our own country in Europe, but more broadly.', 'QUESTION: Do you believe that President Obama underestimated ISIS when he called it the J.V. team?', ""CLINTON: Look, I don't think it's useful to go back in and replow old ground. I think that, from the perspective of what they had accomplished at that time, even though they had seized and held territory, the major focus of our government was on trying to remove Assad from power, so that there could be a resolution, a political resolution."", ""And there were so many groups fighting. There were so many other factors at work. Now that ISIS has made clear that I think in part because they have been pushed hard by the airstrikes, by the Kurds, they're now expanding their reach so that they can keep their propaganda going."", ""So I think there's been, you know, an evolution in their threat and we have to meet it."", 'QUESTION: A couple of days ago, the New York Times had a headline that said, ""Paris Attacks Complicate Hillary Clinton\'s Alignment With Obama."" Has it?', ""CLINTON: Well, it's not the first headline I've disagreed with. [laughter]"", ""Look, I—I have made clear that I have differences, as I think any two people do. I was very proud to serve as President Obama's secretary of state. I think we made a good team. We largely agreed on what needed to be done to repair our alliances, to get our country in a position to deal with the wars that had been inherited, and to take on some of the new challenges we faced."", 'But even when I was still there, which is publicly known, I thought we needed to do more earlier to try to identify indigenous Syrian fighters, so-called ""moderates""—and I do think there were some early on—that we could have done more to help them in their fight against Assad. But, you know, this is an evolving and fast-moving situation. I think we\'re all, you know, working to, you know, make sure that what we do actually will produce the results we seek.', ""QUESTION: When you were secretary of state, you tended to agree a great deal with the then-Secretary of Defense Bob Gates. Gates was opposed to a no-fly zone in Syria; thought it was an act of war that was risky and dangerous. This seems to me the major difference right now between what the president—what Obama's administration is doing and what you're proposing."", 'Do you not—why do you disagree with Bob Gates on this?', 'CLINTON: Well, I—I believe that the no-fly zone is merited and can be implemented, again, in a coalition, not an American-only no-fly zone. I fully respect Bob and his knowledge about the difficulties of implementing a no-fly zone. But if you look at where we are right now, we have to try to clear the air of the bombing attacks that are still being carried out to a limited extent by the Syrian military, now supplemented by the Russian air force.', 'And I think we have a chance to do that now. We have a no-fly zone over northern Iraq for years to protect the Kurds. And it proved to be successful, not easy—it never is—but I think now is the time for us to revisit those plans.', ""I also believe, as I said in the speech, that if we begin the conversation about a no-fly zone, something that, you know, Turkey discussed with me back when I was secretary of state in 2012, it will confront a lot of our partners in the region and beyond about what they're going to do. And it can give us leverage in the discussions that Secretary Kerry is carrying on right now."", 'So I see it as both a strategic opportunity on the ground, and an opportunity for leverage in the peace negotiations.', ""QUESTION: You talked about Arab partners, but it's worth noting that after having announced with great fanfare that they would join us in the strikes, Saudi Arabia has essentially dropped out. The UAE has essentially dropped out."", 'What would you—what could—can you do particularly to make these key Sunni states that seem more interested in fighting in Yemen, where they are battling a Shiite force, as they see it? What can you do to make them actually take this on as their struggle?', ""CLINTON: Well, that's—we did build that coalition with respect to Libya. We had the UAE, Qatar, Jordan involved in what we were doing on the ground, and it takes constant outreach and, obviously, you have to define the problem in a way that they see it as affecting their national interests. And you're right, the Saudis were actually involved in Syria and now have put all of their resources against the Houthis and the Iranian backers of the Houthis in Yemen."", 'Now, what does that mean? Well, it means that they see the battle that they want to fight as one against Iran and its proxies. My argument to them would be, left unattended, you could have Iranian reach from Tehran to Baghdad. If you allow Syria to fall into as terrible a distress as it currently is and basically Assad being a proxy for, a frontman for the Iranians, the Russians are interested in their naval base. And so you will find a consolidation of authority with the Iranians and moving into Baghdad even more so.', ""So what you're facing in Yemen could be a limited preview of what you could face going forward, unless we get some concerted effort to stop the fighting and to seek a political solution that does give some room to all the different groups within Syria to have a say in the future."", ""QUESTION: Donald Trump says that if you look back, you see that every time—I get a laugh just saying it...[laughter]... Donald Trump says that every time we deposed or encouraged the removal of a dictator in the Middle East, what has followed has been political chaos and a worse humanitarian situation than existed before. And if you look at Iraq, if you look at Libya, if you look Yemen, you look at the fragility of the Assad regime and what it has produced, isn't he right?"", 'CLINTON: Well, he has a very short-term view of history, because it is not at all clear what the final outcome will be in the places that you named. As I mentioned in the speech, I spoke about the foundations of the region sinking into the sand just as the Arab Spring was breaking. And I did so not knowing about the Arab Spring coming to full bloom, but because it was so clear that what was being done by dictatorships, by the denial of opportunity, by the repression, by the sectarian divide just could not stand. It was going to explode at some point or another.', ""And with the developments in Libya, for example, the Libyan people have voted twice in free and fair elections for the kind of leadership they want. They have not been able to figure out how to prevent the disruptions that they are confronted with because of internal divides and because of some of the external pressures that are coming from terrorist groups and others. So it's—I think it's too soon to tell and I think it's something that we have to be, you know, looking at very closely."", ""Now, deposing Milosevic left problems, but problems that we came at by having a deal—in fact, my husband's in Dayton today speaking about the Dayton Accord where people who had been slaughtering each other had to come together and resolve to exist within a government together. Is it perfect? No, but has it, you know, kind of going, and do we have some work to do there? Absolutely."", 'So, we have to look at all these different situations, I think, on their own as well as part of bigger trends.', 'QUESTION: Several of the people running against you against—against whoever the Democrat is, argue that—argue that we should not be taking in Syrian refugees, but we do, we should prioritize Christian refugees.', 'Jeb Bush has said this, Ted Cruz has said this. And the argument is that they are being persecuted, particularly harshly by ISIS.', ""Why isn't that right?"", ""CLINTON: Well, I just don't think we should have religious tests about who we bring as refugees into our country. We've had—last I looked, more than 2 million refugees since 1990."", ""So far, we know that trying to do vet and understand the connections that a person or a family might have with somebody in the United States, you know, looking to see what organization, often a faith-based organization, will sponsor them and what they'll do to help them get education or a job, is by far the best way to sort out and to determine who should be included."", ""Now, this is going to take a long time, I mean, really doing this is hard under any circumstances. Doing it when people are essentially stateless, they don't necessarily have documents, it's hard to do the vetting, is going to be challenging. Which is, again, why I said in the speech that Congress should be providing resources for us to do it right, you know, not trying to stop it."", ""I just don't believe that's in keeping with our values or our history, and frankly it doesn't send the kind of message that we want to send to the rest of the world."", 'So, yeah, we have to be careful, we have to be vigilant and we have to have a system that does all of that.', ""QUESTION: Let's open it up to members of the Council."", 'Let me—if somebody wants to put up their hand, identify themselves, and please make sure it is a question, with a question mark at the end, and it be brief. So.', 'QUESTION: Thank you very much for your comments.', 'With respect to TPP, I would like to understand a little bit better why you oppose it, and what changes would perhaps make it acceptable to you?', 'CLINTON: I think—you know, there are two problems that I see with it.', ""One the final language of the treaty itself, which I don't think went far enough to meet the test that I've always applied to any trade agreement—I have voted for them and I have voted against them when I was a senator—does it help to create more good paying jobs in America? Does it raise incomes, does it advance our national security?"", ""And I think there are enough unanswered questions. It was an—it was an extraordinary effort to try to bring these countries together to come up with an agreement, but I think that at the end of the day, for a number of reasons, including that they couldn't figure how to get currency into the agreement and it's only in a side agreement, I opposed it."", 'The other side of the coin, though, is we have been doing so little—because of Republican opposition, mostly, to better train and prepare people who have been, really, either sidelined or whacked up in—against their head by globalization.', ""Globalization is real, it's happening, it's having an impact. We don't have a good training program, we don't have the kind of support that people need to be able to move into positions where they can acquire new skills."", ""And I see those two things as going together because we have to first and foremost focus on how we better prepare more Americans to be competitive in the global economy, and I don't think we've done that. I want to see that done alongside any trade agreement to a greater extent than the Republicans have been willing to support it."", ""MODERATOR: Ma'am?"", ""QUESTION: Madam Secretary, Amy Bondurant. So importantly, you've recommended that the U.S. lead the air coalition, and I wondered what next steps might be taken to ensure that that would happen."", ""CLINTON: Well Amy, there's nothing magic or easy about putting together such a coalition. I know President Hollande will be coming to the United States to see President Obama this week, and I assume that there will be a group of French officials, defense officials, intelligence officials, homeland security officials who will be meeting with their American counterparts. And on the defense side, I think that certainly the United States working with France and then from that, you know, sort of hub beginning to reach out to other countries to seek out support. And I would go back to Arab countries as well. So looking for a way to begin the discussions about the negotiations that lead to the coalition as quickly as possible."", ""You know, going back to Libya, you know, the Europeans were the ones who wanted American support, and we did not agree to do so until we had a very clear idea what they were willing to do. And then we reached out and worked with the Arab League so that there would be Arab partners as well, and that took weeks. It wasn't something that just happened overnight. But it is definitely doable if we begin, I think, with the French-American position and move out from there."", 'MODERATOR: [off-mike]', ""QUESTION: Terry Whitney, Castle. My understanding was with regard to U.S. support for Syrian rebels over the last year or two, one of the main restraints was that they could not fight Assad directly and that this was a severe limitation and part of the reason the plan didn't work. When you recommend supporting additional training for Syrian rebel groups, would you advise them to allow them to fight Assad, or is that a part of the conflict that we don't want to get involved in?"", ""CLINTON: Well, back in the first term when Leon Panetta and Dave Petraeus and I made our recommendation about vetting and arming Syrian moderate rebels, the target was Assad, it was to defend themselves and be able to prevent the military taking over territory and creating the kind of humanitarian disaster that obviously we've all seen. So that was what we recommended back in the first term."", ""Since then, I know it's been a very difficult task for the—our government to take on and pursue successfully, but one of the challenges has been trying to draw lines, and you draw lines because you want to be able to vet and follow what happens to the arms that you are equipping people with."", ""But what happened to some of the few groups that have been trained is that they were quickly overrun by much more hardened fighters who were fighting Assad, so it was a—it was a very hard task to do, two or three years later. I think it might have been, but again, I have said many times, I can't predict sitting here what would have happened if we moved earlier."", ""It might have worked, it might not have worked. But you can't really take Syrians who are rebelling against Assad, and tell them they can't use their training and their weapons against the person who, as I said my speech, has killed far more Syrians than ISIS has to date."", 'QUESTION: Let me ask a follow-up on that, Madam Secretary, if the only way you can put together a moderate Syrian force is by having the United States cajole, bribe, arm and train it, we are then looking for this force to defeat ISIS, then defeat Assad, then defeat al-Nusra, then defeat other Al Qaida affiliates, keep at bay the Shiite militias and Hezbollah, take control of Damascus and establish a pluralistic democracy in Syria.', ""Isn't that kind of a tall order? [laughter]"", ""CLINTON: Well, certainly, described like that. And that's why I focused on ISIS. I mean, because I think it's—I think right now, we have one overriding goal. As I outlined, we need to crush their territorial domain, and we need to try to secure the entire border between Syria and Turkey."", 'There is not going to be a successful military effort at this point to overturn Assad. That can only happen to the political process, so our efforts should be focused on ISIS, and yes, there are other terrorist groups, al-Nusra, whom you mentioned, is that particularly lethal fighter.', 'QUESTION: So, no fight against Assad for now?', ""CLINTON: There—we have to prioritize, and we had an opportunity, perhaps, I won't say that it would've worked. But right now, we've got the Russians in protecting Assad, the Iranians and Hezbollah protecting Assad."", 'We need to get people to turn against the common enemy of ISIS, and then we need to figure out how we put together a political outcome that provides enough autonomy, so that the separate communities within Syria will be able to re-create a Syrian state, even though it probably is unlikely it will be controlled by the Alawites from Damascus the same way it was before the civil war started.', 'QUESTION: There is policy here, but there is also politics. There are, inescapably, people trying to appear tough and tougher.', 'If there were, God forbid, another terrorist attack, God forbid, in the United States, do you think the pressure to send American troops into Syria would be unstoppable?', 'CLINTON: Well, it would certainly grow, but I think it would be a mistake.', 'Look, as I said, we should be sending more special operators, we should be empowering our trainers in Iraq, we should be, you know, leading an air coalition, using both fighter planes and drones.', ""We have a lot of work to do to be able to really decimate ISIS in Iraq and in Syria. But we've got to work with the Kurds on both sides of the border, we have got to figure out how to, if possible, have a second Arab Awakening in Anbar Province, get the Sunni tribes to feel that it is their fight again, as they once did."", 'And that requires a lot of political pressure being put on Baghdad. Injecting some large contingent of American forces complicates that, in my opinion. Right now, we need to keep the pressure on the people on the ground, and get them to change their priorities and work together.', 'MODERATOR: Final question.', 'QUESTION: Jim Ziren , Madam Secretary. Hi. Back to the no-fly zone. are you advocating a no-fly zone over the entire country or a partial no-fly zone over an enclave where refugees might find a safe haven? And in the event of either, do you foresee see you might be potentially provoking the Russians?', ""CLINTON: I am advocating the second, a no-fly zone principally over northern Syria close to the Turkish border, cutting off the supply lines, trying to provide some safe refuges for refugees so they don't have to leave Syria, creating a safe space away from the barrel bombs and the other bombardments by the Syrians. And I would certainly expect to and hope to work with the Russians to be able to do that."", ""You know, the Russians have, as you know, then I primarily focused on Assad's enemies and not on ISIS. I think that has changed, and there is an indication that has changed. After Hollande comes here, he's going to go to Moscow to see Putin, and I—and as I said earlier, I think getting Russia to play a role in that and getting Assad to understand that what happens to him will be a result of a political resolution, which Secretary Kerry is undertaking right now, but to have a swath of territory that could be a safe zone both for Syrians so they wouldn't have to leave but also for humanitarian relief. And I think that it would give us this extra leverage that I'm looking for in the diplomatic pursuits with Russia with respect to the political outcome in Syria."", ""MODERATOR: We can take one last brief question. Ma'am?"", 'QUESTION: Thank you. (Inaudible.) My question relates to Saudi Arabia. Do you think that the goals that you outlined in the Middle East can be achieved without more cooperation from Saudi Arabia? And if not, how do you think [inaudible] can be convinced to change course?', ""CLINTON: Well, I think that that the Saudis are critical to achieving the goals, and, you know, the Saudis are now engaged in the discussions that Secretary Kerry is leading, they're in the same process as the Iranians, which is something that was hard to get to but finally achieved. And I think that the Saudis have a multiple level of responsibilities, first and foremost, stopping their own citizens from continuing the financing for extremists."", 'And, you know, Saudi financing is still a major source of revenue for terrorist groups inside Syria, inside Iraq elsewhere.', 'MODERATOR: Including—including ISIS, you think?', ""CLINTON: I have no evidence of that, but there—ISIS has become quite a self-financing terrorist network with their theft of oil, selling it on the black market with their destruction and seizure of antiquities, selling that on the black market, with their taking over Mosul and raiding the banks. They've got a source of funding, so I don't really know. But I know that the—that Saudi individuals have certainly funded other related terrorist groups over time and also exported a lot of Wahhabi radicalism by kicking out or sending out imams and teachers to set up schools and mosques to preach that particularly harsh brand of Islam."", ""So the Saudis have a lot that they can do to both stop and then to help. And that's why I said, look, they are legitimately concerned about a takeover in Yemen that butts up against their border."", 'And so, that is why they are expending a lot of money and a lot of military resources, trying to beat back the Houthis, trying to reestablish Hadian government. They have got a lot going on there.', ""But I would hope to draw them into a broader reading of what's going on in the region. And you know, for a lot of people, the Sunni-Shia sectarian divide is one of the major reasons for what's happening there."", ""It's understandable, but the Saudis need to have a broader view, and looking at Iran's influence inside Syria, their growing influence in Iraq as well as in Yemen, they need to understand they have to help us stabilize at least Northern Syria to start with, while trying to come up with some resolution of the Civil War."", 'And I hope they will be more willing to be involved.', 'MODERATOR: Madam Secretary, thank you so much for giving us your time. [applause]', 'CLINTON: Thank you.']"

Right. And I will do anything to find common ground but I will also stand my ground. There are some things that are not good for the country. I will not give in on those, but there is a lot of room here to find that common ground and we have to do it.', ""ROSE: Yes. But you know a lot of people think the biggest problem for America is Washington. That's the problem. And that's partly reflected in some of the politics that we're seeing."", ""CLINTON: Yes, that's true. But look at the way our founders set it up. They set up the separation of powers—"", 'ROSE: Three branches of government.', ""CLINTON: And they made it really difficult to get things done, and some years it's really hard, and we're in one of these periods where we have a minority within the other party that doesn't believe in compromise, doesn't believe in reaching consensus—"", ""ROSE: But there you go attacking them. That's not the way to do it."", 'CLINTON: No, no. No—because part of what you have to do is make it clear to everyone else who is in that party that there is room for negotiation.

Let's not turn our nose up at it."", ""ROSE: That's General Petraeus."", 'CLINTON: That\'s General Petraeus whom you recently talked with and was very straightforward and said, ""Look, we basically paid the tribal sheiks in Anbar"" and now we would probably continue that across the border into Syria to pull together a fighting force, and it works. And it worked, in part, because of revulsion against the predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq, the treatment of everybody at their hands, but it also worked because they were promised that they would have the autonomy and authority to make a lot of decisions within Iraq on their own behalf.', ""And unfortunately, Maliki and his views toward sectarianism slowly but surely undermined all of that. And now you've got the Sunni sheiks, the fighters on the sidelines or, even worse, some of them making common cause with ISIS."", ""ROSE:?—which raises an interesting question. Did we lose influence with the Baghdad government because we didn't have any remaining troops there? Would that have made a difference in terms of the behavior so that the Sunnis would not be so turned off by Baghdad?"", ""CLINTON: Well, I certainly thought we should keep troops there. I advocated for that. The real problem was Maliki. He would not give us what's called a status of forces agreement that would provide the protections for American troops that we have to expect anywhere in the world."", 'And despite our best efforts, despite trying to negotiate and bargain with him, other members of his government, even the parliament, we were not able to reach that agreement. And the prior administration, the Bush administration had set a date certain for us to withdraw.', 'So in the absence of an agreement with Maliki, we had to withdraw. Now, that is what he wanted. I mean he made all kinds of promises to the administration which he did not fulfill.', 'ROSE: Was the absence of American troops, did it help lead to the strengthening of ISIS?', ""CLINTON: I wouldn't go that far. I think it was the collapse of the internal agreements. Our understanding was that we had help them build up a force that would respect Sunnis, that they would have a place in the Iraqi army, that there was going to be a national guard that would be created, that would, in effect, protect the Sunnis and give them some sense of, you know, autonomy, enabling them to protect themselves. And then, of course, the Kurds, with their ongoing arguments with Baghdad over oil distribution and autonomy."", ""So what Maliki did, and he was the driving force, was to begin to purge the army of Sunni officers, begin to take a hard line against the Kurds and their desire for more autonomy. And so, I really place the blame, such as it can be placed, at Maliki's feet."", 'ROSE: What should be the limits of our involvement?', ""CLINTON: Well, I think we have to look at this from several different perspectives. Number one, if we are going to lead a multi-national coalition, we're going to still have to take the lead in the air. That is our highest and best use. And even with France picking up at airstrikes, we're still, you know, carrying out the vast majority of them."", ""We also need to get those Special Forces that the President has authorized into the arena as soon as possible because they will be able to tell us what more is needed. And, in particular, how do we have better targeting on the ground. We want to go after the ISIS leadership, we want to go after their economic infrastructure—how do we really know what we're targeting?"", 'ROSE: But General Petraeus, as you mentioned the interview, said to me that we should be embedding at the battalion level and not just Special Forces.', ""CLINTON: Well, we don't really have—I couldn't tell whether he was meaning the Iraqi army, if we ever get it stood up again. That's something we could look at. We have over 3,000 American troops in Iraq trying to do just that, working to essentially undo the damage that Maliki did to the army, try to return it to what it was when American troops left."", 'And I think that, you know, their main missions are train, assist and enable and if, down the road, it appears that we do get them up and willing to take the fight to Mosul and Ramadi and the areas that have to be taken back from ISIS inside Iraq, then there will be a role for Americans to perhaps be a part of advising those army units.', ""We're a long way from that. We don't—and from what I'm told—even yet have confidence that we could put them back into the fight. And at the same time, let's not forget what we were talking about earlier. We need to be building up a Sunni force, and that will have to operate on a parallel track to the army."", 'ROSE: But many people say we have been talking about this for a while, how do we get the Sunnis involved. There is a new urgency now—', 'CLINTON: Right.', 'ROSE:?—and a new emergency now.', 'CLINTON: Right.', ""ROSE: I mean tell me how serious the threat of ISIS is and at what level do we decide we'll do anything we have to do to stop them?"", ""CLINTON: I think we have to have as our objective their defeat, so what is it you have to do to defeat them? And I think you have to fight them in the air, you have to fight them on the ground and you have to fight them in cyberspace. Now it seems to me there are people both currently serving and retired like General Petraeus who know a lot of the players. And we should be utilizing anyone who has that kind of personal contact because it's all relationship based."", ""We need people to go over there and look into the eyes of some of those tribal sheiks who will say you betrayed us, and we'll say, no, we didn't. When we left we had promises about continuing to pay the Sunni troops and continuing to have an integrated army. And we had promises. They were systematically broken."", ""So let's do this again right. You stood against al Qaeda in Iraq because you saw the damage they were doing to your way of life, to your people—the oppressive, violent approach that they took. Now you're facing an even more barbaric enemy which has more money and now controls territory. We need to get back in the game and we need to help you do that."", 'ROSE: Do we need to make coalition with Russia to do this?', 'CLINTON: Well, I think we need, first of all, to build a coalition of Europeans and Arab states. We have to work with—', ""ROSE: Don't we have that now?"", 'CLINTON: Well, we have it, but I would say—', ""ROSE: And don't we see more participation by the British in terms of proposals to their parliament and the French are clearly energized."", 'CLINTON: Well, the French are energized. The Brits are still waiting to see whether they can be. We do have a number of our European allies who are flying sorties. The Arabs have kind of pulled back and we need to get them reengaged.', ""But with respect to Russia, I am not yet sure what exactly Putin's objectives are. We know that he has been bombing a lot of the opposition to Assad. We have to operate on two tracks at one time in a lot of what we're doing, as I just was saying in another regard."", ""When it comes to Russia, they have to understand that we are going to go forward with our multi-national, multi-pronged approach. I still believe a no-fly zone is important to try to provide some safe haven on the ground, taking back the Syrian-Turkish border is going to require Turkish help. It's going to require the Russians to be at least respectful of our efforts."", 'So we need to be engaged. We are engaged on a military to military—', 'ROSE: There is some communication between—', 'CLINTON: Absolutely.', 'ROSE:?—the defense minister and the secretary of defense.', 'CLINTON: Yes. And we have de-conflicted the airspace that we both are in, so we are not making the mistakes. But what they did invading whether intentionally or unintentionally Turkish airspace after having been warned repeatedly by the Turks—', 'ROSE: So what do you think?', 'CLINTON: Well, what I think is that they did.', 'ROSE: They invaded on purpose?', ""CLINTON: Well, no, I don't know—I said intentionally or unintentionally. But they were on notice to stay back. You know it's not—you can make a mistake, but they got so close that a mistake was possible or they just didn't care."", 'ROSE: so why did they do that? What is Putin trying to say to the world?', 'CLINTON: Yes, well, I think this probably was not something that came down from the Kremlin. You know, they want to go after those forces that are threatening Assad, some of whom are near the Turkish border. But by invading the airspace—and this is not the first time that they came close to doing it. NATO has issued a warning, the Turks have issued warnings.', ""It showed a disregard for the perspective of others, most particularly the Turks, that it's troubling. Now, I think they have been pushed back, and I think that we'll be able to have a more realistic conversation with them, which I would urge."", ""ROSE: But isn't Putin's interest pretty clear? He wants to be relevant. He wants to be a player. He wants to be part of the decision-making that takes place about Syria and he wants to say to the world Russia is important in the Middle East again—"", 'CLINTON: Right.', ""ROSE:?—and he's accomplished that."", ""CLINTON: Well, he has certainly staked a claim to it. But whether he's accomplished or not is not clear. Because here's what also what has to happen—another one of these dual tracks there, Charlie. We need to get over the false choice between either going after Assad or going after ISIS."", 'ROSE: Yes. Help us understand that because everybody is talking about that.', 'CLINTON: Yes.', ""ROSE: How do you do both? Well, I think you do both by making it clear and bringing the Russians in. You know, The Russians have now paid a big price because of the bomb in their jet coming from Sharm el-Sheikh. So they've lost people to ISIS—right."", ""I think you say, look, we need, your if not your active help, your acquiescence in what we're going to do going after ISIS. So that means you're going to have to pull back from this area while we go after their leadership and their economic infrastructure."", ""But if you want to be part of that, we would welcome you. You have a dog in this hunt now because you're worried about what's happening in the Caucasus. You're worried about ISIS spreading its ideology."", 'At the same time we have to accelerate the political and diplomatic efforts and this is what Secretary Kerry is trying to do—in Vienna and everywhere.', ""CLINTON:?—in Vienna and everywhere and there has to be more willingness on the part of Russia and Iran to take a hard look at how we prioritize. Right now we're not going to see a military defeat of Assad. That's not going to happen. It might have been possible a few years ago. It's not going to happen now."", ""You're going to continue to see Russia from the air, Iran from the ground where Iranian soldiers are dying on behalf of Assad. You're going to see them continue to try to hold the territory they have and push back against the opposition."", ""So part of what we have to do is say, look, you've got to help us get to a political and diplomatic solution and you've got to either get out of the way or come on board with respect to ISIS, and we have to be very clear about that. And this should be a full-throated effort."", ""ROSE: And you have to convince Assad, who's your client almost, that your time is limited."", 'CLINTON: And that there will be a transition.', 'ROSE: Right.', ""CLINTON: Now, knowing the Russians and the Iranians who have a lot invested in Assad, this is a long process. It's not going to won't happen overnight. But if they will in their own mind, say quit bombing the people who are helping us fight ISIS, go ahead and put a cordon around the area that Assad still controls, protect him there while we do the diplomatic and political work."", ""ROSE: Someone people would like to ask you this question. I mean we had the 3:00 phone call during a previous campaign—what would you do. And so the question becomes, if there is a no-fly zone, which you're advocating, and the Russians invade that no-fly zone, would President Clinton say shoot it down if you give it warning?"", ""CLINTON: Charlie—that would not happen because we're going to put up a no-fly zone where the Russians are clearly kept informed. I want them at the table. They don't have to participate in it but I want them to understand that there have to be safe areas on the ground."", ""If we can stop hundreds of thousands of more Syrians leaving Syria because they get to a place where they can get medical aid and food and the like, that's good for Russia. Why does Russia want this incredible burden that is going to be coming up through Europe and, yes, maybe they are happy to see Europe suffering like this but, in the end, it makes no sense for them and makes no sense for all of us."", ""And so I think you've got to have that conversation. Look, it's never easy with the Russians and particularly hard with Putin, but if you say, as I think you should and as I think the conversation needs to get to an operational level. And then, at the same time, a conversation with Putin about what our options truly are, I think you can say to him, we're going to put up this no fly zone. You will know very well where it is because it's going to be the same people who are working now to de-conflict airspace—"", 'ROSE: Yes.', ""CLINTON: The same Americans you're dealing with on a mill to mill level but we have got to figure out how to keep more Syrians in Syria and frankly it's good for the fight against ISIS if we've got population that then can be a locus for that."", 'ROSE: A no-fly zone is one way—one place where you and the President disagree on policy with respect to Syria.', 'CLINTON: Right.', 'ROSE: Are there others in which there is a difference? We saw what you said at the Council on Foreign Relations. We saw the interview he did in Turkey. You seemed to be similarly responding to what the situation is. Where else do you differ in addition to no-fly zones?', 'CLINTON: Well, look, I think the President has said that perhaps we should have taken some additional steps earlier. But the real question is—', 'ROSE: That goes back to the point when you and Petraeus and others were recommending more in 2011.', 'CLINTON: Right, yes.', ""But now the important issue is what do we do now? And I think I'm arguing for perhaps a greater, quicker intensification of the work that I think needs to be done. I agree with the President's point that we're not putting American combat troops back into Syria or Iraq. We are not going to do that."", 'ROSE: Under no circumstances would you not do that?', ""CLINTON: Well, at this point, I cannot conceive of any circumstances where I would agree to do that because I think the best way to defeat ISIS is, as I've said, from the air which we lead; on the ground which we enable, empower, train, equip; and in cyberspace where, don't forget, they are a formidable adversary online."", ""So what I want to say is, look, we don't know yet how many Special Forces might be needed, how many trainers and surveillance and enablers might be needed, but in terms of thousands of combat troops like some on the Republican side are recommending, I think that should be a non-starter."", ""And it should be a non-starter both because I don't think it's the smartest way to go after ISIS. I think it gives ISIS a new recruitment tool if we get back in the fight. Whereas if we are equipping and supporting the Kurds, if we get the Sunni tribes back in the fight, then we can do a lot to make sure that works."", 'ROSE: Let me take you to another time—Libya.', 'You were a strong if not the strongest proponent of the U.S. and the French and others going to protect Benghazi at a time that it faced almost certain attack by Gadhafi leading to, as he said, massacre in the streets.', 'Was that a mistake when you look at what has happened since in Libya?', ""CLINTON: First of all, it's important to remember that the Libyans themselves held two successful free and fair elections. You know how hard that is after conflict, after 42 years when every institution has been hollowed out? The Libyan people rose to the occasion. They voted for moderates. Then, unfortunately, there was a lot going on in the region that was not necessarily in the control of anybody but which had a big impact on Libya."", ""ROSE: So I have two questions about that. First question is I think you were going to—I mean is there some lesson we need to learn and that may be applicable to Syria, don't get rid of a strong man until you have somebody that can come in there because you do not want chaos and you do not want the kind of circumstance in Libya because what you have in Libya now is an increasing force of ISIS."", ""CLINTON: Well, in one part of Libya. Yes, let me address that because it's a totally fair question."", 'Gadhafi had American blood on his hands. Gadhafi was a threat to the broader region. Our European and Arab friends certainly saw him as that and as you say he was promising to track down his own people and kill them like cockroaches.', 'My point was that with his demise, there was a coalition that rose up. They did hold elections. They were prepared to begin forming a government and there was a lot of pressure coming at them from extremists in all directions. And some of the old attitudes like the split between Tripoli and Benghazi; between, you know, east and west began to assert themselves.', ""I believe that right now there is an ongoing effort by the U.N. and others the U.S. is supporting to try to form a unity government, to try to get people once again to get back to working together. The problem, is we see advances by ISIS—they're not the only terrorist group—"", 'ROSE: Sure.', ""CLINTON:?—but ISIS now claims that they have really taken control of Sirte, which happens to be Gadhafi's hometown. I think one of the ways we need to approach this is continue the discussions about national unity but, as a pre-condition, say we need to join together right now before they get a stronghold and work to eliminate ISIS in Sirte, and it is something that is going to require a lot of cooperation."", ""There are armed groups that are fighting for power within Libya that are not in any way identified with or allied with ISIS. They need to form even a loose confederation to try to push ISIS literally into the sea before they get a stronghold. There are a lot of other bad actors, don't get me wrong, bad actors who have taken up—"", ""ROSE: But could this also be part of the way the President thinks about things now? I mean we go in with great intentions, we help participate in the Arab Spring. It was their revolt, not ours. And we end up with where it's not successful, democracy does not emerge and you end up with, in some cases, failed states or states that seem to be on the verge of becoming failed states. And, so, it's just not a place for America to be."", ""CLINTON: Again, I think it's dangerous to make these sweeping generalizations. Look at how valiantly the Tunisians are struggling."", ""ROSE: They're the big exception."", ""CLINTON: They're the big exception because they're a relatively small country and they've worked really hard to get everybody under a tent, so to speak, and get them organized."", ""Libya has pockets of functioning government, but they are not united, and it may well be very difficult to unite them because there has been historical rivalry between them. But we're talking about four years. You know we have a very quick time table—"", ""ROSE: I know. We didn't create democracy overnight."", ""CLINTON: We did not, no. And nobody that I know relay has. That's not to say there is not dangers. And I do think if we could turn the clock back, if there had been a way, and we tried, to convince the Libyans to take more help, not just from Americans but from Europeans with whom they had preexisting relationships or even others that might have come to support them—the Scandinavians, for example—help them do more. They were so proud and they were so resistant to having security forces on their territory. They were even resistant to having foreigners come and help them figure out how better to run their oil industry."", 'They had a lot of really smart people who had been expats for decades, they came home and they wanted to do it themselves. If there had been a way that we could have better partnered with them, supported them, maybe it would have made a difference. But this is a long-term prospect that you have to be looking at.', ""ROSE: Speak to this. I mean we're looking at a world that's changing rapidly. I mean you've got China soon to become the biggest economy in the world and whatever their ambitions are. You have the Middle East which is close to exploding in some cases, some would suggest you have the Russians involved, you've got others involved."", 'How do we make our way in a sort of New World order and what is our role to do that?', ""CLINTON: Well, I think our role is to lead. You know, the absence of American leadership is not somebody else's leadership."", 'ROSE: But they say—let me interrupt --', 'CLINTON: Nothing.', 'ROSE: OK. But some argue that there has been a vacuum—that America has not been leading.', 'CLINTON: Well, then we should get about the business of leading. If that is a perception, we need to rid the perception.', 'ROSE: Who knows better than that than you? I mean there is a perception that we were not prepared to lead.', 'CLINTON: Well, look, I think it is a very—', 'ROSE: And a vacuum was created.', ""CLINTON: Well, I think it's a very complex set of circumstances, and it's important to look short-term, medium-term, long-term, right? I remember in some of the arguments I had in the White House over Mubarak. And you know, there was a lot of excitement about Mubarak falling. I was one of the skeptics, right, because what was going to replace him? Yes, had he been a heavy-handed authoritarian? He had. But what was the alternative? And I remember saying, you know, this may look great in 25 years, but between now and then, there is a lot of trouble for the Egyptians, the region and us."", ""And so I think you have to be constantly balancing what is the best decision you can make today, how do you think about what comes next, what are the consequences you're either trying to promote or prevent, and then what are the long-term challenges and how do we get prepared for those? I mean it sounds easy to say. It's very difficult to do."", ""And I think, look, when I became Secretary of State, Osama bin laden was alive and with his lieutenants plotting against us. Iran was on a fast track to a nuclear weapon. We had hundreds of thousands of American troops in the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan and our alliances were incredibly frayed, Charlie. You know, it's important to remember that, in 2009, our big challenges were seemingly as difficult as the ones we're talking about now."", 'So all these years later—', 'ROSE: Compounded by economic problems.', ""CLINTON:?—compounded by a terrible great recession that could have become a great depression. And so we worked our way out of that. I don't think President Obama gets the credit he deserves for literally saving the economy from a much worse fate."", ""Bin laden is dead. Al Qaeda is still alive. It's on, you know, maybe life support, but it's still alive. It's still kicking. It still is inspirational. We have to keep our eye on it. We can't just focus on ISIS. We have to be aware of al Qaeda's continue maneuvering."", ""We did reach an agreement that put a lid on Iran's nuclear weapon program which could have led to a conflagration in the Persian Gulf. Not maybe started by us but in which we might very well have—"", 'ROSE: OK, but that did not speak to Iranian behavior.', ""CLINTON: No but—it wasn't meant to."", 'ROSE: I understand that. I understood that. I am not suggesting it should have been.', 'CLINTON: Yes, right.', 'ROSE: I am suggesting that Iranian behavior is going to be an issue for the next president.', ""CLINTON: Absolutely. And I've been saying this—again, I gave a big speech about what I will do as president and to deal with enforcing the agreement, because there are a lot of important details, and the Iranians have to know right from the beginning that they will pay a price, that there will be consequences for any misbehavior or breaches. And that we have to now turn our attention to dealing with their other bad behavior—still exporting terrorism, destabilizing other regimes."", 'So, yes, there is a bucket of problems that we have to deal with that the Iranians are posing.', 'ROSE: But how do we deal with those problems because they are part of—', 'CLINTON: Charlie, I would rather deal with those with the nuclear program.', ""ROSE: I'm not arguing about the nuclear—"", 'CLINTON: No, but this is a big deal because what the nuclear program literally under lid, so to speak—', 'ROSE: Right.', ""CLINTON: Now, it's not so, you know, important that we stay as focused. We have to enforce the agreement but we're not spending all our time and effort dealing with their nuclear program which they really got under fast track when Bush was president and we had to deal with it."", ""Now we have to look at all their other bad behavior and we have to have the same kind of patient, strategic planning that went in to the agreement. You know, I started putting together the coalition to impose the sanctions within the first month of being in the secretary of state's office. It takes time."", 'I had to convince the Russians and the Chinese. I had to convince the Europeans, especially the southern Europeans to give up oil and gas from Iran.', ""This was a long struggle, basically, but it was diplomacy that was day by day which reached results. Now we've got to take a look and say, OK, what is it we have to do? Well, clearly, we've got to keep forces in the Persian Gulf. We've got to do a better job dealing with our Gulf partners who I think are very short-sighted in failing to cooperate with one another, to deal with some of the threats."", ""ROSE: Yes, but I mean for many of our gulf partners, Iran is the biggest enemy there is. I mean it's part of the Sunni-Shia split in the region."", 'CLINTON: Of course it is. Of course it is.', ""ROSE: And that's why they want to get rid of Assad who is supported by the Iranians as you know."", ""CLINTON: And he's an Alawites which is, you know, an off shoot of Shiism. Yes, we get all of that. But the good news out of the Iran agreement, as far as we know, they are not pursuing their own nuclear weapons right now. And that was a very real threat."", ""They understood that the agreement was better than they thought it would be, so they, too, can turn their attention to the rest of this bad behavior because what our big fear was, not only that we'd get a war over trying to prevent Iran from going forward with this program even if it was only two or three years, but that we would see a wicked race to proliferation in the Gulf."", 'ROSE: And this deal should stop that?', ""CLINTON: At least for the years that it's in effect, as long as we enforce it."", 'ROSE: This conversation part is about American leadership.', 'CLINTON: Right.', 'ROSE: You suggested over the weekend I think that America should lead at the climate conference in Paris.', 'CLINTON: Yes.', 'ROSE: How should America lead there and what are your expectations?', 'CLINTON: Well, I give kudos to the President. I think given the hand he was dealt by this congress and the difficulty in trying to come up with a credible plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our own country, he has played that hand very well. I mean a lot of the EPA moves, a lot of the Department of Transportation on greater mileage from cars and trucks and vehicles, I think he goes to Paris in a strong position to be able to say, look, we all have to come and agree.', 'ROSE: Right.', 'CLINTON: He also comes with a commitment for the United States to do more on innovation and moving more quickly toward clean energy, and he comes with the great philanthropic commitment of Bill Gates.', ""ROSE: Do you think he'll be successful?

Right.', ""ROSE: That's fair enough."", 'You understand the importance of trade.', ""CLINTON: Yes, of course I do. We're 5 percent of the world's population. If we're going to grow, we have to sell to the other 95 percent. I absolutely understand that."", ""But here are two problems. One, I've had the same criteria for judging trade agreements for years. I voted for some and I voted against a big multi-national one when I was in the senate."", 'ROSE: But you were really in favor of this one?', ""CLINTON: No. It hadn't even been negotiated."", ""ROSE: That's the impression though as you know."", ""CLINTON: Well, I can't help what impressions are. What I said from the beginning is it has to produce more good paying jobs for Americans. It has to raise Americans' wages and it has to be in furtherance of our national security. So when it came out, you know, none of us saw the details until it was actually produced some few months ago."", ""In my opinion, it didn't meet those standards. And so I said I'm against it. Now, I'm not against all trade, but I am against certain provisions of this, including the failure to integrate currency manipulation into the enforceable body of the agreement."", ""But there is another point I just want to quickly make which is, you know, the Republicans are always for every trade agreement.

Radical elements who use a dangerous and distorted view of Islam to promote their jihadist ambitions, I'm fine with that. I say it all the time and I go after Islamic, too."", ""STEPHANOPOULOS: So what's the problem with radical Islam?"", 'CLINTON: Well, the problem is that that sounds like we are declaring war against a religion.

No. They would not be covered.

So why the shift?', ""CLINTON: Well, because number one the kind of plan that was passed in the Affordable Care Act gives you a market-based way of getting into the insurance market. So, if you can afford to buy a policy, you can. You don't get, however, any of the subsidies that American citizens get."", ""STEPHANOPOULOS: Martin O'Malley says they should. Why not?"", ""CLINTON: Well, I disagree with him. I think part of comprehensive immigration reform should be looking at all of these issues. But as things stand right now, under the Affordable Care Act, if you have the money and you are undocumented, you can buy into it, but without the subsidies. That's why it's important we continue to support community health centers, we continue to support our hospitals because those are often the places that undocumented people and poor people go."", ""STEPHANOPOULOS: And what's the reason for not going further?"", ""CLINTON: Because I don't think legally you can. I mean, that is not something that we can legally support. The law is very clear about that."", ""STEPHANOPOULOS: Donald Trump.

I mean tens of millions of people have watched him for more than a decade on TV and he is part of the celebrity and he will stay whatever he wants to say and if he's held account, that—it's not true, he just brushes it off and he goes on. And I think that, you know, there's a certain attractiveness to people that here's a guy who says exactly what he believes, untrue as it may be, inflammatory as it certainly is."", ""STEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, you said you're getting better at learning from your critics. They tell you things that your friends won't."", 'So what have you learned from your critics in this campaign?', ""CLINTON: You know, I've said for a long time, George, that I try—I try to take criticism seriously but not personally.

And today, I want to talk about how we keep our country safe from a threat that's on everyone's minds, the threat of terrorism."", ""But I want to begin by saying, we cannot give in to fear. We can't let it stop us from doing what is right and necessary to make us safe, and doing it in way that is consistent with our values."", 'We cannot let fear push us into reckless actions that end up making us less safe. Americans are going to have to act with both courage and clarity.', 'Now, as we all know, on December 2nd, two shooters killed 14 people at a holiday party in San Bernardino, California.', 'Sadly, in America in 2015, turning on the news and hearing about a mass shooting is not unusual. But this one turned out to be different, because these killers were a husband and wife inspired by ISIS.', 'Americans have experienced terrorism before. On 9/11, we learned that terrorists in Afghanistan could strike our homeland. From Fort Hood to Chattanooga to the Boston Marathon, we saw people radicalized here carrying out deadly attacks.', 'But San Bernardino felt different. Maybe it was the timing, coming so soon after Paris. Maybe it was how random it seemed, a terrorist attack in a suburban office park, not a high-profile target or symbol of American power. It made us all feel it could have been anywhere, at any time.', 'The phrase ""active shooter"" should not be one we have to teach our children. But it is.', ""And now we are all grappling with what all this means for our future, for our safety, our sense of well-being, and our trust and connections with our neighbors. We want to be open-hearted, and we want to celebrate America's diversity, not fear it."", 'And while we know the overwhelming majority of people here and around the world hate ISIS and love peace, we do have to be prepared for more terrorists plotting attacks.', 'Just yesterday, a man in Maryland was charged with receiving thousands of dollars from ISIS for use in planning an attack. And here in Minnesota, authorities have charged ten men with conspiring to provide material support to ISIS.', 'But in the Twin Cities, you have also seen firsthand how communities come together to resist radicalization: local imams condemning terrorist violence, local artists and activists pushing back against terrorist propaganda.', 'I just met with a group of community leaders who told me about some of the work and the challenges that they are dealing with.', 'As the first Somali-American police sergeant in Minnesota, and probably in the country, said recently, ""Safety is a shared responsibility, so we have to work together.""', ""The threat we face is daunting. But America has overcome big challenges many times before. Throughout our history, we've stared into the face of evil and refused to blink. We beat Fascism, won the Cold War, brought Osama bin Laden to justice."", ""So no one should ever underestimate the determination of the American people. And I am confident we will once again choose resolve over fear. And we will defeat these new enemies, just as we've defeated those who've threatened us in the past."", 'Because it is not enough to contain ISIS, we must defeat ISIS, break its momentum and then its back. And not just ISIS, but the broader radical jihadist movement that also includes al Qaeda and offshoots like al Shabaab in Somalia.', 'Now, waging and winning this fight will require serious leadership. But unfortunately, our political debate has been anything but serious.', ""We can't afford another major ground war in the Middle East. That's exactly what ISIS wants from us. Shallow slogans don't add up to a strategy. Promising to carpet bomb until the desert glows doesn't make you sound strong, it makes you sound like you're in over your head. Bluster and bigotry are not credentials for becoming Commander-in-Chief."", 'And it is hard to take seriously senators who talk tough but then hold up key national security nominations, including the top official at the Treasury Department responsible for disrupting terrorist financing.', ""Every day that's wasted on partisan gridlock could put Americans in danger. So, yes, we need a serious discussion. And that's why in a speech last month before the Council on Foreign Relations I laid out a three-part plan to defeat ISIS and the broader extremist movement."", 'One, defeat ISIS in the Middle East by smashing its stronghold, hitting its fighters, leaders, and infrastructure from the air, and intensifying support for local forces who can pursue them on the ground.', 'Second, defeat them around the world by dismantling the global network of terror that supplies radical jihadists with money, arms, propaganda, and fighters.', 'And third, defeat them here at home by foiling plots, disrupting radicalization, and hardening our defenses.', 'Now, these three lines of effort reinforce one another. So we need to pursue all of them at once, using every pillar of American power.', ""It will require skillful diplomacy to continue Secretary Kerry's efforts to encourage political reconciliation in Iraq and political transition in Syria, enabling more Sunni Arabs and Kurdish fighters to take on ISIS on both sides of the border, and to get our Arab and Turkish partners to actually step up and do their part."", 'It will require more U.S. and allied airpower, and a broader target set for strikes by planes and drones, with proper safeguards.', 'It will require Special Operations units to advise and train local forces and conduct key counterterrorism missions.', 'What it will not require is tens of thousands of American combat troops. That is not the right action for us to take in this situation.', 'So there is a lot to do, and today, I want to focus on the third part of my plan, how we defend our country and prevent radicalization here at home.', 'We need a comprehensive strategy to counter each step in the process that can lead to an attack like the one in San Bernardino.', 'First, we have to shut down ISIS recruitment in the United States, especially online.', 'Second, stop would-be jihadists from getting training overseas, and stop foreign terrorists from coming here.', 'Third, discover and disrupt plots before they can be carried out.', 'Fourth, support law enforcement officers who risk their lives to prevent and respond to attacks.', 'And fifth, empower our Muslim-American communities, who are on the front-lines of the fight against radicalization.', 'This is a 360-degree strategy to keep America safe, and I want to walk through each of the elements, from recruitment to training to planning to execution.', 'First, shutting down recruitment. We have to stop jihadists from radicalizing new recruits in-person and through social media, chat rooms, and what\'s called the ""Dark Web.""', 'To do that, we need stronger relationships between Washington, Silicon Valley, and all of our great tech companies and entrepreneurs. American innovation is a powerful force, and we have to put it to work defeating ISIS.', ""That starts with understanding where and how recruitment happens. Our security professionals need to more effectively track and analyze ISIS's social media posts and map jihadist networks, and they need help from the tech community."", 'Companies should redouble their efforts to maintain and enforce their own service agreements and other necessary policies to police their networks, identifying extremist content and removing it.', 'Now, many are already doing this, and sharing those best practices more widely is important.', 'At the State Department, I started an interagency center to combat violent jihadist messages, to have a better way to communicate on behalf of our values, and to give young people drawn to those messages an alternative narrative.', 'We recruited specialists fluent in Arabic, Urdu, and Somali to wage online battles with extremists to counter their propaganda.', 'Now, those efforts have not kept pace with the threat, so we need to step up our game, in partnership with the private sector and credible moderate voices outside government.', ""But that's just some of what we have to do. Experts from the FBI, the intelligence community, Homeland Security, DOD, the State Department, and the technology industry should work together to develop a unified national strategy to defeat ISIS in cyberspace, using all of our capabilities to deny jihadists virtual territory, just as we work to deny them actual territory."", 'And at the same time, we also have to do more to address the challenge of radicalization, whatever form it takes.', ""It's imperative that the Saudis, the Qataris, the Kuwaitis and others stop their citizens from supporting radical schools, madrassas and mosques around the world, once and for all, and that should be the top priority in all of our discussions with these countries."", 'Now, second, we have to prevent ISIS recruits from training abroad, and prevent foreign jihadists from coming here.', 'Most urgent is stemming the flow of fighters from Europe and America to Iraq and Syria, and then back home again.', 'The United States and our allies need to know the identities of every fighter who makes that trip, and then share information with each other in real time.', ""Right now, European nations don't always alert each other when they turn away a suspected extremist at the border or when a passport is stolen. They have to dramatically improve intelligence sharing and counterterrorism cooperation. And we're ready to help them do that."", 'We also need to take down the network of enablers who help jihadists finance and facilitate their travel, forge documents, and evade detection. And the United States and our allies should commit to revoke the passports and visas of jihadists who have gone to join ISIS or other groups, and bring the full force of law against them.', ""As I've said before, the United States has to take a close look at our visa programs. And I am glad the administration and Congress are stepping up scrutiny in the wake of San Bernardino. And that should include scrutinizing applicants' social media postings. We also should dispatch more Homeland Security agents to high-risk countries to better investigate visa applicants."", ""For many years, America has waived visa requirements for travelers from countries with reliable security procedures, including key allies in Europe and Asia. That makes sense. But we also have to be smart. Except for limited exceptions like diplomats and aid workers, anyone who has traveled in the past five years to a country facing serious problems with terrorism and foreign fighters should have to go through a full visa investigation, no matter where they're from."", ""We also have to be vigilant in screening and vetting refugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security and diplomatic professionals. Rigorous vetting already takes place while these refugees are still overseas, and it's a process that historically takes 18 to 24 months."", 'But Congress needs to provide enough resources to ensure we have sufficient personnel deployed to run the most thorough possible process.', 'And just as important, we cannot allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values and our humanitarian obligations.', 'Turning away orphans, applying a religious test that discriminates against Muslims, slamming the door on every single Syrian refugee; that is not who we are. We are better than that.', 'It would be a cruel irony indeed if ISIS can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from finding new ones. \xa0So after rigorous screening, we should welcome families fleeing Syria just as the Twin Cities and this state have welcomed previous generations of refugees, exiles, and immigrants.', 'Of course, the key is to prevent terrorists also from exploiting our compassion and endangering our security. But we can do this. And I think we must.', 'Third, we have to discover and disrupt jihadist plots before they can be carried out. This is going to take better intelligence collection, analysis, and sharing. I\'ve proposed an ""intelligence surge"" against ISIS that includes more operations officers and linguists, enhancing our technical surveillance of overseas targets, intercepting terrorist communications, flying more reconnaissance missions to track terrorists\' movements, and developing even closer partnerships with other intelligence services.', 'President Obama recently signed the USA Freedom Act, which was passed by a bipartisan majority in Congress. It protects civil liberties while maintaining capabilities that our intelligence and law enforcement agencies need to keep us safe. However, the new law is now under attack from presidential candidates on the left and right. Some would strip away crucial counterterrorism tools, even with appropriate judicial and congressional oversight. Others seem eager to go back to discredited practices of the past.', ""I don't think we can afford to let either view prevail. Now, encryption of mobile devices and communications does present a particularly tough problem with important implications for security and civil liberties. Law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals warn that impenetrable encryption may make it harder for them to investigate plots and prevent future attacks. On the other hand, there are very legitimate worries about privacy, network security, and creating new vulnerabilities that bad actors can exploit."", ""I know there's no magic fix to this dilemma that will satisfy all these concerns. But we can't just throw up our hands. The tech community and the government have to stop seeing each other as adversaries and start working together to keep us safe from terrorists.\xa0 And even as we make sure law enforcement officials get the tools they need to prevent attacks, it's essential that we also make sure jihadists don't get the tools they need to carry out attacks."", ""It defies common sense that Republicans in Congress refuse to make it harder for potential terrorists to buy guns. If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun, period.\xa0 And we should insist on comprehensive background checks and close loopholes that allow potential terrorists to buy weapons online or at gun shows. And I think it's time to restore the ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines."", ""I know this will drive some of our Republican friends a little crazy. You'll probably hear it tonight. They will say that guns are a totally separate issue, nothing to do with terrorism. Well, I have news for them, terrorists use guns to kill Americans. And I think we should make it a lot harder for them from to do that ever again."", ""And there's a question, a question they should be asked: Why don't the Republican candidates want to do that? \xa0\xa0You see, I have this old fashioned idea that we elect a President in part, in large part, to keep us safe, from terrorists, from gun violence, from whatever threatens our families and communities. And I'm not going to let the gun lobby or anyone else tell me that's not the right path for us to go down."", 'Now, the fourth element in my strategy is supporting law enforcement officers who risk their lives to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks.', 'In San Bernardino, city, county, state, and federal authorities acted with speed and courage to prevent even more loss of life. Like Detective Jorge Lozano, a 15-year police veteran, who assured terrified civilians, ""I\'ll take a bullet before you do."" There is no limit to the gratitude we owe to law enforcement professionals like that Detective Lozano who run toward danger to try to save lives. And not just in the immediate wake of an attack. Our police, firefighters, and emergency responders will keep putting their lives on the line long after the cameras move on.', ""It's disgraceful that Congress has thus far failed to keep faith with first responders suffering from the lasting health effects of 9/11. Many of them were men and women I was so proud to represent as a Senator from New York. The Zadroga 9/11 Health Act never should have been allowed to lapse. It looks like Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may have finally dropped his opposition. And I hope the American people will hold him to that. And we will continue to honor the service and sacrifice of those who responded to the worst terrorist attack in our history."", 'We have to make sure that local law enforcement has the resources and training they need to keep us safe. And they should be more closely synced up with national counterterrorism experts, including with better use of ""fusion centers"" that serve as clearinghouses for intelligence and coordination.', 'And we need to strengthen our defenses and our resilience wherever we\'re vulnerable, whether it\'s ""soft targets"" like shopping malls or higher-profile targets like airports, railways, or power plants. We have to build on the progress of the Obama Administration in locking down loose nuclear materials, and other WMD, so they never fall into the hands of terrorists who seek them actively around the world.', 'So we should be providing the Department of Homeland Security with the resources it needs to stay one step ahead, not trying to privatize key functions, like TSA, as some Republicans have proposed.', ""And it's important for us to recognize that when we talk about law enforcement, we have made progress in being sure that our federal authorities share information with our state and local authorities, but that was an issue I tackled after 9/11, and we have to stay really vigilant so that information is in the hands where it needs to be."", ""Finally, the fifth element in the strategy is empowering Muslim-American communities who are on the front-lines of the fight against radicalization. There are millions of peace-loving Muslims living, working, raising families, and paying taxes in our country. These Americans may be our first, last, and best defense against home grown radicalization and terrorism. They are the most likely to recognize the insidious effects of radicalization before it's too late, intervene to help set a young person straight. They are the best positioned to block anything going forward."", ""That's why law enforcement has worked so hard since 9/11 to build up trust and strong relationships within Muslim-American communities. \xa0Here in the Twin Cities, you have an innovative partnership that brings together parents, teachers, imams, and others in the Somali-American community with law enforcement, non-profits, local businesses, mental health professionals and others to intervene with young people who are at risk."", ""It's called the Building Community Resilience Pilot Program, and it deserves increased support. It has not gotten the financial resources that it needs to do everything the people involved in it know they can do. And we've got to do a better job of supporting it."", ""Now I know that like many places across the country, there's more work to do to increase trust between communities and law enforcement. Just last month, I know here a young African American man was fatally shot by a police officer. And I understand an investigation is underway. Whatever the outcome, tragedies like this raise hard questions about racial justice in America and put at risk efforts to build the community relationships that help keep us safe from crime and from terrorism."", 'When people see that respect and trust are two-way streets, they\'re more likely to work hand-in-hand with law enforcement. One of the mothers of the 10 men recently charged with conspiring with terrorists said, ""We have to stop the denial,"" she told other parents that. ""We have to talk to our kids and work with the FBI."" That\'s a message we need to hear from leaders within Muslim-American communities across our country.', ""But we also want to highlight the successes in Muslim American communities, and there are so many of them. I just met with the first Somali-American council member of the City Council here. And he was proudly telling me how much change Somali immigrants, now Muslim-Americans have made in parts of the city and neighborhoods that had been pretty much hollowed out. Let's look at the successes."", ""If we're going to full integrate everyone into America, then we need to be seeing all their contributions, too. And that is one of the many reasons why we must all stand up against offensive, inflammatory, hateful, anti-Muslim rhetoric. You know, not only do these comments cut against everything we stand for as Americans, they are also dangerous."", 'As the Director of the FBI told Congress recently, anything that erodes trust with Muslim-Americans makes the job of law enforcement more difficult. We need every community invested in this fight, not alienated and sitting on the sidelines.', ""One of the community leaders I met with told me that a lot of the children in the community are now afraid to go to school. They're not only afraid of being perceived as a threat, they are afraid of being threatened because of who they are. This is such a open-hearted and generous community, I hope there will be even more efforts perhaps under the aegis of the university and certainly Governor Dayton and others, to bring people together to reassure members of the community, particularly children and teenagers that they are welcome, invited and valued here in this city and state."", ""Now Donald Trump's proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States has rightly sparked outrage across our country and around the world. Even some of the other Republican candidates are saying he's gone too far. But the truth is, many of those same candidates have also said disgraceful things about Muslims. And this kind of divisive rhetoric actually plays into the hands of terrorists. It alienates partners and undermines moderates we need around the world in the fight against ISIS."", ""You know, you hear a lot of talk from some of the other candidates about coalitions. Everyone seems to want one. But there's not nearly as much talk about what it actually takes to build a coalition and make it work. I know how hard this is because I've done it. And I can tell you, insulting potential allies doesn't make it any easier."", ""And demonizing Muslims also feeds a narrative that jihadists use to recruit new followers around the world, that the United States is at war with Islam. As both the Pentagon and the FBI have said in the past week, we cannot in any way lend credence to that twisted idea. This is not a clash of civilizations. It's a clash between civilization and barbarism and that's how it must be seen and fought."", ""Some will tell you that our open society is a vulnerability in the struggle against terrorism. I disagree. I believe our tolerance and diversity are at the core of our strength. At a Naturalization ceremony for new citizens today in Washington, President Obama noted the tension throughout our history between welcoming or rejecting the stranger. It is, he said, about the meaning of America, what kind of country do we want to be? And it's about the capacity of each generation to honor the creed as old as our founding, E Pluribus Unum. Out of many we are one."", ""President Obama is right, and it matters. It's no coincidence that American Muslims have long been better integrated and less susceptible to radicalization than Muslims in less welcoming countries. \xa0We can't give in to demagogues who play on our basest instincts. We must instead rely on the principles written into our American DNA. Freedom. Equality. Opportunity."", 'America is strongest when all our people believe they have a stake in our country and our future, no matter where they\'re from, what they look like, how they worship, or who they love. \xa0Our country was founded by people fleeing religious persecution. As George Washington put it, the United States gives ""to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance."" So to all our Muslim-American brothers and sisters, this is your country too. And I am proud to be your fellow American.', ""And I want to remind us, particularly our Republican friends, that George W. Bush was right. Six days after 9/11 he went to a Muslim community center and here's what he said, those who feel like they can intimidate our fellow citizens to take their anger don't represent the best of America, they represent the worst of human kind, and they should be ashamed of that kind of behavior."", 'So if you want to see the best of America, you need look no further than Army Captain Humayun Khan. He was born in the United Arab Emirates. He moved to Maryland as a small child, and later graduated from the University of Virginia, before enlisting in the U.S. Army.', 'In June 2004, he was serving in Iraq. One day, while his infantry unit was guarding the gates of their base, a suspicious vehicle appeared. Captain Khan told his troops to get back, but he went forward. He took ten steps toward the car before it exploded. Captain Khan was killed, but his unit was saved by his courageous acts. Captain Khan was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. He was just 27 years old.', '""We still wonder what made him take those 10 steps,"" Khan\'s father said in a recent interview.', '""Maybe that\'s the point,"" he went on, ""where all the values, all the service to country, all the things he learned in this country kicked in. It was those values that made him take those 10 steps. Those 10 steps told us we did not make a mistake in moving to this country,"" his father finished.', ""As hard as this is, it's time to move from fear to resolve. It's time to stand up and say,"", '""We are Americans."" We are the greatest nation on earth not in spite of the challenges we\'ve faced, but because of them. \xa0Americans will not buckle or break. \xa0We will not turn on each other or turn on our principles. We will pursue our enemies with unyielding power and purpose. We will crush their would-be caliphate and counter radical jihadism wherever it takes root. \xa0We\'re in it for the long haul. And we\'ll stand taller and stronger than they can possibly imagine.', ""That's what we do here. It's who we are. That's how we'll win, by looking at one another with respect, with concern, with commitment. That's the America that I know makes us all so proud to be a part of."", 'Thank you all very much.']"

And when I called on her, she basically said I have a husband with early onset Alzheimer's, I have a mother with Alzheimer's. I'm taking care of them. What are you going to do about Alzheimer's?"", 'And it really caused me to think hard about the kind of president I want to be. Obviously, I want to be a president who gets the economy moving for everybody and get incomes rising and more good paying jobs. And I want to be a president that keeps us safe and secure, and takes on the threat and dangers that we face.', ""But I also want to be a president who works for families, like Brenda's. Who understands that the problems we keep you up at night are ones that we also have to take seriously. So, it means the world to me to have her support in this campaign."", ""And as I've said to her and to others who have raised issues with me during the course of my time here in New Hampshire, I will do everything I can to try and find answers. You know, in Alzheimer's, as she said, we have got five million people currently suffering. The projection is for many millions more."", 'It is the sixth leading cause of death in America.

We don't know if they're guilty of anything other than poverty because they can't meet the bail that has been set for them. And we need to do a careful analysis of who can and should be released from prison while we try to deal with people who don't pose a threat to the community, particularly the numbers of people with low-level drug offenses who need treatment, not imprisonment. And so we've got to look at all of this and... [applause]"", ""... yet, I don't think that's enough, and it goes back to the gentleman's question over there in the hat. The issue is, OK, if we're going to divert people from prison, what are the things we're going to do?"", ""Well, I'm a big believer in drug courts, I think drug courts are a much better option than imprisoning people. They should be given recovery, they should be held accountable. I believe that there are more programs that are cheaper and better."", ""And I want to just quickly tell you about a program I visited in Reno, Nevada. And it was a program originally started for alcoholics—people that were found on the street and were picked up, taken to jail. A month later, they'd be on the street again, taken to jail, or maybe they'd end up being put into an ambulance, taken to the emergency room, maybe admitted. A month or two later, back on the street."", 'So, a really great partnership between the county sheriff\'s office and Catholic charities said, ""there\'s gotta be a better way. First of all, it\'s really expensive to jail and imprison people."" So they built a facility that had small bedrooms, that had work to be done, that offered this option to people they were picking up, saying, ""you can either go back to jail, back to—you know, the life you\'ve had, or you can try this.""', 'And they got enough people to try it. They tested them three times a day to make sure they weren\'t cheating. And the sheriff said to me—he said, ""you know—want to know the best thing about this?"" He said, ""because I can—I can justify this anywhere.""', ""He said the first year, the sheriff's office and the hospital and the jail saved $4 million, because they were no longer putting people in high, intensive places like jails and emergency rooms."", ""Now they're moving on to drug addiction, because we've got to think differently about how to help people overcome the problems that they confront. And I just don't think jail is a place for people with substance abuse or mental health problems. And therefore, we need different approaches...

I hope we get through them all.', 'CLINTON: Thanks, Chris.', ""MATTHEWS: Back in 2001, when we had 9/11 and you were a senator from New York, there was a different spirit in this country, including the Republican Party. You had a Republican president who went on the air and made it clear time and again this is not a battle between the West and the East. It's not about Muslims. It's about terrorism. And he did it so effectively."", ""And now we have the leading candidate for the Republican nomination for president basically declaring a war on Muslims, saying they're not allowed in the country, the whole works. What do you make of this?"", ""CLINTON: Well, it's deeply distressing to me because I, as you know, well remember what happened after 9/11. And I have publicly given President Bush a lot of credit for the way that he set the tone and his entire administration echoed that."", ""And now we need to have a sense of unity and purpose in combatting terrorism. I view it as a threat. I believe ISIS cannot be contained. It has to be defeated. But in order to do that, we need to work within our own country with Muslim Americans, so that what I'm hearing from the other side, is not only offensive and shameful, it's dangerous, counterproductive. And of course, we have to work with countries around the world in order to have a unified coalition against terrorism."", ""And I've laid out very clearly what I think needs to be done, and it does include an American-led air alliance, and we're doing that. And we're supporting troops on the ground that are not Americans, special forces, but we do need to have the Kurds and the Arabs with special forces support, but not American combat troops."", 'And we need to go after the arc of instability that fuels this terrorist ideology from North Africa to Pakistan, Afghanistan, and go after their funding and their foreign fighters and their very effective use of the Internet.', ""But then the third pillar of my approach is we have to be safe here at home. We have to work with our friends and allies around the world. And I know you just got back from Israel. We have a lot of important work to do with countries from one end of the globe to the other. And we need to do it in alliance with Muslims here in America and elsewhere. And that's what I'm advocating."", ""MATTHEWS: That's why I'm concerned about the Republican Party because this ethnic way of going at this situation, the way they seem to be going at the Muslim people, rather than the terrorists—this started—remember when the man whose name we dare not speak anymore, Donald Trump—I mean, the fact is, Trump started his sort of initiation in politics by saying the president of the United States was an illegal immigrant, he was probably a Muslim, he had a—he almost was an identity thief who created a notion of himself through a phony birth certificate, a phony birth announcement, and he was somehow—in fact, he used to say things—Trump would say things like, Nobody knew him in school, like he's some phantom impersonator, usurper."", 'The Republican Party, every time he did that, said nothing.', 'CLINTON: Right.', ""MATTHEWS: Boehner, the speaker of the House, who was pretty much respected, wouldn't—isn't this a Republican Party problem, that started with Trump's first arrival on the world stage as some sort of politician, that it's ethnic with them?

It's pretty sick."", ""CLINTON: Well, it's very divisive and I think counterproductive. It undermines our values, who we are as a people. We are a nation of immigrants, which you know so well. And when I hear what's coming from the other side—and it's not just one person. There's an echo chamber there. And it's very troubling to me to try to divide and conquer, divide and conquer, and you know, a house divided against itself cannot stand."", ""We need to be united. And we should not reward people who use inflammatory rhetoric, who use the kind of derogatory comments, whether it's about Muslims or Mexicans or women or people with disabilities, whoever it might be.

I saw the no-fly zone as leverage. Number one, if we could get the Russians on board, because we would have to—and I think we could, if we were to say, look, we need safe zones. If we're going to be operating on the ground, advising the Kurds, the Arabs, we need safe zones."", ""We also need safe places for civilians, so that they're not refugees leaving Iraq and Syria.

29,            Hillary Clinton          ,"January 10, 2016","[""DICKERSON: We're going to get right to our lead guest, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is in Chappaqua, New York, this morning."", 'Good morning, Secretary Clinton.', 'I want to start with politics. We\'re going to talk about a lot today, but let\'s start with politics. A new NBC/""Wall Street Journal""/Marist poll says in Iowa it\'s 48-45, you over Sanders. You were once way ahead. So, what\'s happening?', 'CLINTON: Oh, John, you know these polls go up, they go down.', ""I stay pretty focused, as I think we all should, on what we have to do to build on the progress of the Obama administration, but go even further. And that's why I have outlined a very significant agenda to raise wages and to take on the gun lobby and to be making America safe in every way that I can."", 'And those are some of the differences that I have with my primary opponents, and certainly very deep differences with all the Republicans running.', 'DICKERSON: This week, another batch of your e-mails were released by the State Department.', 'One of them is a back-and-forth between you and a staffer about a secure fax that won\'t come through. And you directed him to -- quote -- ""turn into non-paper with no identifying heading and send nonsecure.""', ""Aren't you ordering him to violate the laws on handling classified material there?"", 'CLINTON: No, not at all.', ""And as the State Department said just this week, that did not happen. And it never would have happened, because that's just not the way I treated classified information. Headings are not classification notices. And so, oftentimes, we're trying to get the best information we can."", ""And, obviously, what I'm asking for is whatever can be transmitted, if it doesn't come through secure, to be transmitted on the unclassified system. So, no, there is nothing to that, like so much else that has been talked about in the last year."", 'DICKERSON: So, in no instance -- what is striking about that particular e-mail is it suggests you were very facile with how to do this, this process. You knew the instructions about how to get around the restrictions for sending classified information.', ""So you're saying there was never an instance, any other instance in which you did that?"", ""CLINTON: No. And it wasn't sent. So, I think this is another instance where what is common practice -- namely, look, I need information. I had some points I had to make. And I was looking for a secure fax that could give me the whole picture."", ""But, oftentimes, there's a lot of information that isn't at all classified. So, whatever information can appropriately transmitted unclassified often was. That's true for every agency in the government and who everybody does business with the government."", ""But the important point here is, I had great confidence, because I had worked with Jake Sullivan for years. He is the most meticulous, careful person you could possibly do business with. And he knew exactly what was and wasn't appropriate."", ""And, in fact, as the State Department has said, there was no transmission of any classified information. So, it's another effort by people looking for something to throw against the wall, as you said in the beginning of the program, to see what sticks. But there's no there there."", 'DICKERSON: Well, this one is a little different, since the FBI is investigating this specific question of whether a classification was meddled with.', 'Let me ask you about another e-mail in this batch, which was one in which you seemed to express surprise that somebody e-mailed on their non-State Department personal e-mail, which is what you were doing. Why was that a surprise to you?', 'CLINTON: Well, I e-mailed two people on their government accounts, because I knew that all of that would be part of the government system.', ""And, indeed, the vast majority of all my e-mails are in the government system. So, that's how I conducted the business. I was very clear about e-mailing anything having to do with business to people on their government accounts."", 'DICKERSON: On gun control this week, you have been pretty tough on Bernie Sanders, specifically on the question of legal protection to gun manufacturers.', ""He has now said that he would be interested in looking to changing the law to allow -- to go after gun manufacturers who act irresponsibly. So, isn't that what you want?"", ""CLINTON: No, that's not what I want. And that's not what the country wants. And that's not what President Obama called for. And I think he has been consistently refusing to say that he would vote to repeal this absolute immunity from any kind of responsibility or liability."", ""It's the only industry in our country where we have given that kind of carte blanche to do whatever you want to do with no fear of legal consequences. You know, President Obama and I and Senator Sanders were all in the Senate at the same time. Two of us voted against what the NRA says was the most important piece of legislation in 20 years for the gun lobby. Senator Sanders voted with them, and through this morning has been unwilling to join the president and me in saying that this should be repealed. That has to be the effort that we all are behind. And he often says, well, look, I'm from Vermont and it's different. It's not like being in New York City."", 'Well, in fact, the other senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, voted with President Obama and myself. So, I think that the excuses and efforts by Senator Sanders to avoid responsibility for this vote, which the NRA hailed as the most important in 20 years, points up a clear difference.', ""And it's a difference that Democratic voters in our primary can take into account. Who is going to really stand up to the gun lobby, try to deal with the scourge of gun violence that takes 90 people's lives a day? I'm pretty clear on what I will do. And I support and will work hard to implement what the president has been advocating."", ""DICKERSON: On Senator Sanders' response, this idea that he represents a state which there are lot of gun owners, you were a senator. You -- aren't you sympathetic to that? You said you represented Wall Street, and that's what shaped your views on certain Wall Street policy. And you have suggested that, as president, you would be different than you did as senator, when you were representing a state with a constituency."", 'CLINTON: Well...', ""DICKERSON: So, why isn't it fair for Bernie Sanders to say, as president, I would be different than I would as a senator representing a state with a lot of gun owners?"", 'CLINTON: Well, you know, I think you have really mixed up two important issues here.', 'I have been consistent on gun lobby restrictions. In fact, I supported the Brady Bill. Senator Sanders voted against it five times. So, there is a very clear difference.', ""And when it comes to Wall Street, yes, I represented New York. And I was proud to do so. And I took on Wall Street. I'm the person who came out against derivatives. I'm the person who came out calling for restrictions on CEO pay, which, thankfully, got into the Dodd- Frank bill."", ""I'm the person who went to Wall Street and actually confronted them in 2007. I called them out on the role they were playing in the mortgage market. So, I do have a history of taking on what I consider to be the abuses that come from any industry, including Wall Street."", 'And I will continue to do so as president. And the proposal that I have put forth about how we rein in the excesses of Wall Street, so we never again face what we did in 2008, has been judged as being more comprehensive, tougher, more effective by Barney Frank, by Sherrod Brown, my friend from Ohio who leads the banking efforts in the Senate, and by Paul Krugman. So, I have plan that will go after not just the big banks, because Dodd-Frank has given us the tools to do a lot of that, but to go after the so-called shadow banking industry.', 'DICKERSON: Right.', ""CLINTON: And I think I'm well-prepared. I know what needs to be done. It's kind of like Nixon going to China, John."", 'DICKERSON: All right, Senator, let me ask you about a general election opponent you may face. That is Donald Trump.', 'You got into a pretty ugly exchange. You charged that he -- you charged him with sexism, and then he put out an Instagram video of your husband and Monica Lewinsky. Your reaction to that?', ""CLINTON: Well, if he wants to engage in personal attacks from the past, that's his prerogative. You know, so be it."", ""I'm going to draw the distinctions between where I stand and where he stands when it comes to equal pay for women, raising the minimum wage, which affects two-thirds of the women, who are the ones receiving the minimum wage, protecting a woman's right to make the most personal health care decisions."", ""That's why I'm so proud to have the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund that I received today in New Hampshire, because I'm going to fight as hard as I can against any efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, something that he supports."", ""So, there are very clear distinctions. He can say whatever he wants to about me. Let the voters judge that. But I am not going to let him or any of the other Republicans rip away the progress that women have made. It's been too hard-fought-for. And I'm going to stand up and make it clear there's a huge difference between us."", ""DICKERSON: Secretary Clinton, what do you say, though, to those even in your own party who say that -- a discussion of that portion of your husband's career is fair game to talk about in an election?"", ""CLINTON: Well, it's been fair game going back to the Republicans for some years. They can do it again if they want to. That can be their choice as to how to run in this campaign. Didn't work before. It won't work again, because it is what people are focused on, not for the past, but for the future."", ""What are we going to do to get wages rising? What are we going to do to create more good jobs? What are we going to do keep rights? What are we going to do to make sure that the Supreme Court has people on it who will defend women's rights, who will defend marriage equality, who will defend voter rights?"", ""So, I can't run anybody else's campaign. They can say whatever they want. More power to them. I think it's a dead end, blind alley for them, but let them go. I'm going to talk about the differences between us, because I think that's what Americans care about. DICKERSON: Secretary Clinton, I'm afraid we're at a dead end ourselves and out of time. [laughter]"", 'DICKERSON: Thanks so much for being with us.', ""CLINTON: Thanks. Let's continue the conversation, John."", 'DICKERSON: See you out there.']"
30,            Hillary Clinton          ,"January 13, 2016","['CAMEROTA: Secretary Clinton, thanks so much for sitting down with us here in Iowa.', 'CLINTON: Thank you, Alisyn.', 'CAMEROTA: We are in Ames, Iowa --', 'CLINTON: Yes.', 'CAMEROTA:—where the temperature as we speak is one degree.', 'CLINTON: Uh-hm.', ""CAMEROTA: And I know that you have been going to countless campaign events here and I'm wondering when you get up in the morning in Iowa if there are ever times you question your life choices?"", ""CLINTON: Absolutely, no. You know, I grew up in Chicago. I'm used to cold weather. It doesn't bother me. In fact, I'm somewhat reassured that there is a real winter, that we are actually seeing snow and lower temperatures. But I get up every day whether I'm in Iowa, in New Hampshire, wherever I am in the country and I really look forward to the day because I find the opportunity to go out and listen to people, hear their stories, give them my views about what I think the next president should do very energizing and very, you know, reinvigorating all the time."", 'CAMEROTA: So, let\'s talk about the tightening race between you and Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is speaking to reporters on Monday night here in Iowa. And he said that your campaign is in, quote, ""serious trouble."" Is that how you feel?', ""CLINTON: Not at all. In fact, I have always known that if you are going to run to be president, particularly in the Democratic Party, it's a long, hard, challenging road. And so I've been in these elections before. They always tighten up as people begin to make up their minds, as they look at the candidates, totally predictable. I feel really, really good about the campaign organization that I have. A caucus is different from a primary. It takes a lot of intensive work to convince people to come out on a cold Monday night, spend a couple of hours in order to stand up for your candidate, but I'm asking Iowans if they'll stand up for me on caucus night. I will be standing up for them all through my presidency."", ""CAMEROTA: There is a new Quinnipiac poll out just about one hour ago in which Bernie Sanders is now beating you in Iowa. It is 49 percent to 44 percent. It is the first time that this has happened that he's been beating you in Iowa since September. We are 20 days out. Does he have more momentum than you?"", ""CLINTON: Well, the funny thing Alisyn is, after that poll came out about an hour later there was a PPP poll where I was leading him by the same margin about six points up. I don't pay any attention to this. I don't feel that it's a good reflection about who will actually come out on caucus night. I can only tell you that the energy, the enthusiasm, the excitement of my volunteers, my organizers, the voters who come, who sign up on commit to caucus cards is just building. That's my experience. So I'll let people poll and try to figure out who is going to show up. I'm looking at people who are showing up, making up their minds and trying to, you know, convince them to come out and caucus for me."", ""CAMEROTA: Why don't you feel that the polls are good reflection of what's going to happen in the caucus?"", ""CLINTON: Because they are so unpredictable. And it's gotten increasingly difficult to poll. And I think you would have to add a degree of difficulty to polling for a caucus. So, that's been my experience. I've watched this a long time. I've had a prior election where I campaigned in Iowa. So, I just put that aside. I'll let pundits and others worry about who's up and who's down. I just get up every day like we were saying, going out there, making my case, drawing the contrast because I have the highest regard for my two opponents, but there are real differences. And we need a spirited debate. Because after the first of the year, a lot more people start paying attention. And now I know it's, you know, the make or break time, people make up their minds."", 'CAMEROTA: Bernie Sanders is also winning in New Hampshire. Not surprising. He is from a neighboring state. Have you considered what would happen if he wins in Iowa and New Hampshire what your plan is?', ""CLINTON: I don't think about that. I'm going to do everything I can to win as bigger margin as possible in the caucus and then go to the primary. But this is a national campaign. We've been organizing in South Carolina, in Nevada, a lot of the March 1st states, the March 15th states. Remember, I campaigned all the way into June last time. And I have always thought that given the unpredictability and the, you know, changes in people's concerns going into this election, that we wouldn't know exactly how the outcome would be for, you know, a couple of cycles of these primaries and caucuses. So, I'm going to do my best to convince more Iowans to come out and caucus for me. And even though as you say, Senator Sanders as a neighbor and a neighbor never lost in New Hampshire, I'm going to take that challenge on and do the best I can to get people in New Hampshire to support me, as well."", 'CAMEROTA: Vice President Joe Biden offered his thoughts to CNN on why he thinks Bernie Sanders is resonating. He said that he thinks it\'s about Senator Sanders\' positions on income inequality. And the Vice President said, quote, ""It\'s relatively new for Hillary to talk about that. That\'s been Bernie\'s. No one questions Bernie\'s authenticity on those issues."" What\'s your reaction?', ""CLINTON: Well, the Vice President who I deeply respect and regard as a friend, went on to say as I recall. But, you know, Hillary Clinton has a lot of very good economic policies that are thoughtful and on and on. Look, I have been working toward closing the gaps between people, poor people and well-off people primarily all my adult life. I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund. I helped to reform the education system in Arkansas. I was a legal services lawyer defending poor people. I went to work to try to make sure that we got health care in the beginning of my husband's administration because of so many people who were left out and were uninsured."", ""I have been on this issue in many different ways. How do we make education more equal? How do we make health care more equal? Of course that's tied to income equality, but there is also a broader range of issues that I have a long record of addressing. And when I was in the Senate I took on corporate executive pay. A lot of the abuses that I thought were there. I took on these derivatives and credit default swaps that contributed to the collapse of the economy and the great recession. I stood up to Wall Street. I called them out. So I have a very long record. I have a broader agenda. It's not the only thing I talk about because I think you have to view equality of opportunity and how we deliver that in the 21st Century for many different perspectives and that's what I tried to do."", ""CAMEROTA: And since you have been devoting much of your career to talking about this, why do you think the Vice President would say, it's more in Bernie's wheelhouse and it's about his authenticity?"", ""CLINTON: Oh, I don't know. But you know, I have a lot of regard for the vice president. And I think today he clarified what he said and said he was talking about me when I was Secretary of State. Well, when I was Secretary of State, I couldn't talk about domestic policy. There is an unwritten rule, you do not meddle in domestic policy when you are secretary of state or for that matter, secretary of defense. So yes, for four years, despite a long career both in and out of public service where I have been relentless in talking about these issues, there were four years when I did not. I talked about how we were going to get Iran to the negotiating table and try to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon, how we're going to, you know, deal with a rising China, what we're going to do about women's rights, something that goes to the heart of inequality. So, I had a different agenda because I had a different job."", ""CAMEROTA: So, you didn't take Biden's comments as a slight?"", 'CLINTON: No. Not at all.', 'CAMEROTA: OK. You are introducing your tax plan. One of the headlines is that you would impose a four percent surcharge on incomes over $5 million. And I believe that that would raise about $150 billion over ten years. Does that go far enough in addressing income inequality?', ""CLINTON: Well, we've got a variety of proposals. Not only the four percent surcharge which I call the fair share surcharge. The so-called Buffet Rule which would have a minimum tax rate for people making more than $1 million, limiting deductions to 28 percent with a charitable exception. Going after a lot of the subsidies that, for example, still subsidize the oil and gas industry about $6 billion a year while we have to move toward a clean renewable energy future. So I have put forth plans, paid family leave, tuition, debt-free tuition for public colleges."", ""Capping prescription drug costs and much more. And it would cost about $100 billion a year, all of which I pay for. In contrast, Senator Sanders has some very big ideas, but he hasn't yet told anybody how he would pay for them. And he had promised that he would roll out his tax plans before the Iowa caucus on February 1st. Well, if you wait too long, nobody will have a chance to see them or analyze them. And so I am very clear about what I would do and how I would pay for it."", 'CAMEROTA: Another point of conflict between you and Senator Sanders is on gun policy.', 'CLINTON: Uh-hm.', 'CAMEROTA: We just watched this very emotional event this morning.', 'CLINTON: Yes.', 'CAMEROTA: That you were involved in where this mom who lost two children --', 'CLINTON: Right --', 'CAMEROTA:—to gun violence got up and spoke. And it was really heartbreaking to hear her. It sounds like she lost her children to criminals.', 'CLINTON: Yes.', 'CAMEROTA: So, how would you stop that?', ""CLINTON: This is a very big difference in this campaign. Because as you saw, I received the Brady campaign endorsement today and both the woman Delfin Cherry who introduced us to the stage and the head of the Brady campaign had lost family members. It was really hard standing up there because I have held the hands of and listened to countless people who have lost family members to gun violence. And I agree completely with the President about us having to take action now. We lose on an average 90 people a day. It has to stop, Alisyn. I've been in this campaign advocating for comprehensive background checks, closing the gun show loophole, closing the online loophole, closing what's called the Charleston loophole."", ""You know, there was a loophole, my opponent voted for it, Senator Sanders, that at the end of three days, business days, you get that gun whether they have finished the background check or not. The killer in Charleston who bought that gun, if there had just been a little more time, it would have been discovered he should not have been able to buy the gun because he had a federal record. We have saved a lot of lives. I can't put an exact number on it. But because of the Brady bill which Senator Sanders voted against five times, more than two million people, the Brady campaign says, 2.4 million purchasers have been stopped from buying guns."", ""So, we are talking about violent criminals. We are talking about domestic abusers. We are talking about the dangerously mentally ill. We are even talking about terrorists because the Republicans won't close the loophole so that people on the no fly zone can buy guns. I feel passionately about this. And the cumulation from Sandy Hook to the community college in Oregon, the fact that we have so many mass killings in the last few years, I think it certainly motivated the President, and I am so proud to support him and I want to make this a voting issue in this campaign."", '[break]', ""CAMEROTA: I want to talk about an issue Donald Trump wanted to make an issue in this campaign, that is—are allegations from your husband's past. He is going further actually than that. He is making it about you. He is saying that you are an enabler of bad behavior and of sexual assault."", ""What's your response to Donald Trump?"", ""CLINTON: I have no response. I'm going to let him say whatever he wants to say. He can run his campaign however he wishes. I'm going to keep talking about what the next president will have to do starting January 20th, 2017."", ""I have deep disagreements with what he's proposing. His tax plans would cut trillions of dollars of taxes from the wealthy and corporations. He doesn't believe in equal pay.

I mean, particularly since this is an issue you wanted to talk about on the campaign trail. Can't this sexual assault—you say survivors need to be believed and they need to be heard."", ""So, when he's accusing you of doing something that is the antithesis of what you want to talk about, don't you need to address it?"", ""CLINTON: I'm going to let the American voters decide what's relevant and what's not relevant in their decision as to who they're going to support."", 'CAMEROTA: I have a few more questions.

Campaigns always have some great stories and great characters. That's part of the political process. This is really serious business, who the next president is. We are either going to build on the progress that we've made or we're going to see it ripped away. We are either going to defend human rights and civil rights and women's rights and gay rights and voting rights and workers' rights and all the rest that is at stake, or we are going to turn the clock back."", ""And that's why I have tried to very clearly explain where I stand on all of these issues because the stakes are so high.

The earlier we start, the better we'll be off and we'll get more accomplished."", ""Because I want to really think hard if I do get the nomination, right then and there, how we organize the White House, how we organize the cabinet. What's the legislative agenda?"", ""You know, the time between an election and inauguration is short. You can't wait. I mean, you can't take anything for granted.

And I was part of putting that in place by getting the sanctions imposed on Iran that the entire world went along with.', 'But we also have made it clear from the beginning that their missile activity is still subject to sanction. That is part of the overall approach that the administration has taken toward Iran, and that I support.', ""So, when we became aware of missile activity that is under U.N. supervision and is prohibited, it would be a mistake not to make clear to Iran that we are very, very happy to see us implementing the agreement to put a lid on the nuclear weapons program and the way that they have complied, but that doesn't mean they can now go off and invest and test a lot of missiles that would eventually be able to be intercontinental that could reach the United States and maybe carry a very dangerous weapon."", ""So, I think there might be a misunderstanding of what our whole agreement consists of, because, certainly, I have made clear I'm proud of the role that I played in getting that agreement in place, but, as president, I will enforce it."", 'And there have to be consequences if Iran veers away from what it has agreed to or what it has been mandated to do or prohibited from doing by the international community.', ""TAPPER: Let's turn to politics, obviously a big night tonight, a Democratic debate."", 'You will be facing off with Bernie Sanders in this new, more contentious phase of the election, with just a week and a—two weeks and a day until the Iowa caucuses.', 'One of your top allies, David Brock, is calling on Bernie Sanders to release his medical records.

Donald Trump not giving the president any credit and Marco Rubio says it's going to create incentives for other U.S. adversaries to take hostages."", 'Does he have a point?', ""CLINTON: Well, look, I'm pleased, like I hope everybody is, that we have American citizens coming home this morning from Iran. They were unjustly held there, and I did a lot of work on these issues when Americans were being picked up, falsely charged and imprisoned, to get them home. So I applaud the fact that that's happened."", ""We still don't see Bob Levinson coming home, so we have unfinished questions and business still. But I think this is a part of what we're going to be pursuing—persistent, patient diplomacy."", ""Today's also the day that we have verified the Iranians have followed through on the requirements under the nuclear agreement. They have shipped out the vast majority, I think it's up to 98 percent, of their enriched uranium. They have poured cement into one of the reactors we worried about because of a plutonium potential threat. They have destroyed centrifuges."", ""So this is the kind of smart diplomacy I was proud to be a part of in the first administration of President Obama that we're just going to have to be persistent with, because we have a lot of problems with Iran—their aggressive behavior, their destabilizing of neighboring states, their continuing military support for Assad and so much else."", ""But the fact that we've put the lid on the nuclear weapons program, the fact that we got our prisoners back, I think is a reason for good news."", ""STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's get to the campaign right now."", ""A strange series of events yesterday. The super PAC coordinating with you put out word that they'd be demanding to release of Bernie Sanders' health records. Sanders campaign struck back, calling that vile. Your campaign disavowed it. It appeared to go away."", ""So what is relevant here and what's not?"", 'Should age and health be an issue in this campaign?', ""CLINTON: Oh, look, you know, I put out my medical records. I think you've been around long enough to know, George, this is all part of the expectation."", ""But I think it's fair to say that I share a lot of the same goals with Senator Sanders about what we need to do on behalf of our country. But we have differences. And that's what I'm focusing on now. We're going to have a spirited debate, I expect, tonight in Charleston. Certainly Senator Sanders has been pointing out differences."", 'And one of the issues that I have drawn a very stark contrast on has been guns.', ""You know, I have pointed out repeatedly, because I think it's a critical issue, that Senator Sanders has, for years, voted many times on behalf of the NRA gun lobby position. And one of the most egregious of those votes was the vote to give immunity from all liability to gun makers and sellers. Now, I was happy when -"", 'STEPHANOPOULOS: He now supports taking that away.', ""CLINTON: Well, he flip-flopped last night, said that he would sign on to a bill that is currently pending in the House and Senate to repeal that liability. And I'm delighted that he has had a change of heart. I think that's all for the good."", ""Now I hope he will take a hard look at what we call the Charleston loophole. That's a provision he also voted for, that gives a gun to a potential buyer after three days whether or not the background check has been completed. And it's called the Charleston loophole because that's how the killer in Charleston got his gun when, if there had been a little more time, information would have come to light that would have shown he was prohibited. And, of course, we know he used that gun to go to Mother Emanuel Church and murder nine faithful people at Bible study."", 'So I want to see movement against the gun lobby, because we cannot continue to lose 90 people a day, 33,000 a year, to gun violence.

You know very well that I threw myself into that back in '93 and '94 and still have the scars to show for it. So the goal is we want everybody to have access to quality, affordable health care. But I think we should be defending the Affordable Care Act. This is a historic achievement for our country. It certainly is for President Obama. We are making progress. I want us to protect it, to defend it and to improve it."", ""The Republicans keep trying to repeal it and offer nothing in place of it. So rather than tear it apart or get rid of it and start all over again in a contentious national debate, let's do what I'm proposing, to get costs down, get out of pocket costs down, get more support for families who face big medical costs. Let's deal with the rising cost of prescription drugs. That, I think, is the right way for the country to go and it certainly is what I'm advocating."", ""STEPHANOPOULOS: You also have your differences over Wall Street.

I find that, in a perverse way, an incredibly flattering comment on their anxiety, because they know that not only will I stand up for what the country needs, I will take it to the Republicans. I have a track record which shows I know how to stand up to them.

I have advocated for changes. But what I find sort of strange is, number one, the ad that Senator Sanders ran was really against all Democrats who ever took any contributions from anybody associated with the financial industry. That would include President Obama, who took more anyone ever had in 2008. That did not stop him from turning around and imposing the toughest rules on Wall Street since the 1930s. The same with Barney Frank, who has actually written about this."", 'You know, that is just a false charge.', ""But in addition, I think it's important for us to look at our respective plans. In fact, everyone who has offered an opinion about the plan that Senator Sanders has proposed and the one I put together has said mine is tougher, mine is more comprehensive, it would be more effective, because it tries to get not just at the problems of yesterday, but the potential problems of tomorrow, going after shadow banking and investment banks and big insurance companies, like what we saw in '08 where Lehman Brothers and AIG were principal causes of what happened to us."", ""And I think, finally, I would say that I have gotten maybe 3 percent of my - less than 3 percent of my contributions this time from anybody associated with financial industry activities. I've gotten so much more from students and teachers. Ninety percent of my contributions are from smaller donors and 60 percent from women."", ""So I'm just - you know, I didn't know about Karl Rove's ad against me, but it kind of boosts me up, because I assume he thinks that I am going to get the nomination and he's trying to interfere with the Iowa caucus to maybe confuse people on their way to caucus for me."", 'STEPHANOPOULOS: Madam Secretary, thanks very much for your time this morning.', 'CLINTON: Thank you.', 'Good to talk to you, George.']"

Nationally we still have her with a big lead over Bernie Sanders 59 percent-34 percent.', 'But in Iowa the story has been very different. Three polls out this week alone showing neck and neck race including our own NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls which had Clinton leading by jut 3; Quinnipiac found Sanders actually up by 5 and the ""Des Moines Register"" had Clinton up by just 2. Bottom line, it\'s too close to call.', 'So as they close the race it has become a more aggressive race against Sanders so we begin with Hillary Clinton who joins Clinton campaign against Sanders and so we begin with Hillary Clinton who joins us from Charleston, South Carolina. Good morning—Secretary Clinton.', 'CLINTON: Good morning, Chuck.', 'TODD: Let me start with the Iran deal. Yesterday in response to it you immediately said that Iran is still violating U.N. Security Council resolutions with its ballistic missile program which should be met with new sanctions, designations and firm results.', ""So I guess my question is what do you tell the American public that says you want new sanctions against Iran, they're still violating agreement and yet what did we do? We just handed them $100 billion and we just did a prisoner exchange. Would you have still done that considering your concerns about their missile program?"", ""CLINTON: Absolutely. Look I have said for a long time that I'm very proud of the role that I played in getting us to the point where we could negotiate the agreement that puts a lid on Iran's nuclear weapons program but I've also said that the way we're going to hold them accountable is to have consequences when they do anything that might deviate from the agreement or continue to block the kind of sanctions and mandates the U.N. Security Council has put on, including on missiles."", ""So I see these as mutually reinforcing, Chuck. I was delighted that the prisoners are on their way home. That's a good sign. We still don't see Bob Levinson coming home, there's more work to be done there. But if the implementation of the agreement which is being done today is to be successful in the way that I expect we're going to watch Iran like the proverbial hawk."", ""And when it comes to the missile program, they are under U.N. Security Council sanctions and if they are violating it which the evidence seems to suggest they should be held accountable. They need to know that this is a good step forward with respect to the nuclear weapons program but there are other areas of their behavior that we're going to continue to be focused on."", 'TODD: Do you consider Iran a national security threat to the United States?', ""CLINTON: Well, certainly we have lowered that threat because of the nuclear agreement but they continue to be destabilize governments in the Middle East. They continue to support proxies and terrorist groups like Hezbollah. They continue to threaten Israel. There are a lot of concerns. But what I've said for some time now is I'd rather have the nuclear weapons program off to one side and work to make sure they abide by the agreement and then turn our attention to some of these other behaviors that are threatening, certainly in the region and therefore cause concern for us."", ""TODD: All right. Let me move to the campaign. To try to figure out why this race has gotten closer in Iowa, why your lead has shrunk in Iowa, we spoke to a number of voters.

This is from Democrats—some pause that they have.', ""CLINTON: Well, first of all, Chuck, I always thought this was going to be close and I can't speak for anybody else but I've worked as hard as I can to build an organization in Iowa, to be out there listening and talking with Iowans as they move toward making the first in the nation decision in the caucus on February 1."", ""And I've also been very consistent over the course of my public life. If I tell you I'm going to fight for something, I will do my very best to get results. I think that's why I have such strong support and I feel very good about where we are but we're going to just keep working until the very last caucus is decided on February 1."", ""TODD: You know, another problem you may be having in Iowa is that you don't ideologically fit. This was in the Des Moines Register poll this week. 43 percent of likely Democratic caucus goers identify as socialist. Only 38 percent of likely Democratic caucus goers identified themselves as a capitalist. You, in the last debate, said you were a capitalist. Bernie Sanders calls himself a Democratic socialist. If you don't win Iowa, do you think that's the reason?"", ""CLINTON: Oh, I don't know how people take all this information. But I support a free market economy. I support the competitiveness that has created the greatest economic engine in the history of the world. What I am worried about is that it's not continuing to do what it used to do which is to give the vast majority of Americans the chance to get ahead and stay ahead."", ""That's why I've got a very vigorous jobs agenda.

I was one of the first to call for a complete Department of Justice investigation and, in fact, urged that it include the entire Chicago police department.', ""This is not a problem that is unique to Chicago, unfortunately, and we've got to do more to deal with the systemic racism and the problems that policing has demonstrated. Mayor Emanuel has said that he is committed to complete and total reform and I think he should be held to that standard."", 'TODD: But do you think he still has the credibility to do that?', ""CLINTON: Well, that's going to be up to him and up to the people of Chicago to prove."", 'TODD: Very quickly, the movie ""13 Hours"" about the incident in Benghazi. I know there\'s a lot of chatter about the movie itself. But let me ask you—the controversy involves whether or not everything was done that night to rescue Ambassador Stevens.', 'Looking back, do you believe everything was done that night that could have been done to save his life?', 'CLINTON: Based on everything I know and based on a Republican-led intelligence committee investigation, is a Republican-led arms services committee investigation, the answer to that is yes. That people were scrambling trying to figure out what could be done if anything.', ""And I can't speak to a movie but I know people have raised questions about some of the dramatization. I testified for more than 11 hours, as you know I answered every question I was asked. My real focus, Chuck, is what do we do to make sure that we send Americans into harm's way—military or civilian, diplomats or our soldiers—we take every precaution to the best of our ability in what is an unpredictable and dangerous world to make sure that they can discharge their duties and be safe while doing it."", 'TODD: All right. Secretary Clinton, I have to leave it there. We look forward to seeing you tonight on stage in Charleston for the Democratic debate.', 'CLINTON: Great.', ""TODD: That's right here on NBC. Thank you."", 'CLINTON: Thanks a lot.', 'TODD: You got it.', 'END', 'LOAD-DATE: January 17, 2016', 'LANGUAGE: ENGLISH', 'PUBLICATION-TYPE: Transcript', 'Copyright 2016 Federal News Service, Inc.', 'All Rights Reserved \n', '\xa0', '7 of 1079 DOCUMENTS', 'Federal News Service', 'January 17, 2016 Sunday', 'CBS ""Face the Nation"" Interview with Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Democratic Presidential Candidate', 'LENGTH: 1189 words', '???????????????????????

Good morning, Secretary Clinton.', 'After this prisoner exchange, Senator Marco Rubio said—quote—""If you take an American hostage, Barack Obama will cut a deal with you, whether it\'s Bowe Bergdahl, what he did with the Castro brothers, and now what he\'s done with Iran.""', 'Your reaction to that?', ""CLINTON: Well, I think it's just typical political rhetoric, and it overlooks some very basic, important issues."", 'Number one, we always try to get Americans back who are unjustly held. I certainly did when I was secretary of state. And when I was a senator, I advocated for the Bush administration to do the same for people who have been unlawfully held in foreign countries.', 'Secondly, the important news here is that the Iranian agreement to put a lid on the nuclear weapons program of Iran is being implemented. The Iranians have so far fulfilled their side of the bargain by destroying centrifuges, by shipping out 98 percent or so of their enriched uranium out of their country, even making one of their plutonium reactors under construction no longer able to be ever used because they have poured cement into it.', ""So, the real issue here is, if you're committed to making the world safer and to show strong American leadership, you have to engage in patient, persistent diplomacy with people who are not your friends. They are on the other side of a lot of the issues and values that you hold very dear, and that is certainly true for the United States."", ""DICKERSON: Former FBI agent Robert Levinson is still in Iran. Do you believe that the Iranians know where he is? And, if so, why wasn't he a part of this deal?"", 'CLINTON: Well, I regret deeply that Robert Levinson was not on his way home either. And I hope and expect that the Iranians will continue to be pressed very, very hard to give up any information they have and, if possible, to return Bob Levinson to his home and family.', ""DICKERSON: Switching to the topic of gun control, you have said Bernie Sanders should vote or support the idea of lifting the immunity block on gun manufacturers. He now says he will support the legislation you have pushed him to. So, hasn't he done what you wanted him to do?"", ""CLINTON: Well, I am pleased that Senator Sanders has flip-flopped on legal immunity for gun makers and sellers. Now I hope he will also join members of Congress to change what's called the Charleston loophole that enabled the killer in Charleston to get the gun that he used to murder nine people at Bible study here in Mother Emanuel Church. That's something else Senator Sanders has supported that we need to change."", ""So, now I'm calling on him to also flip-flop in the right direction and sign on the legislation to change the Charleston loophole."", ""DICKERSON: You at once in 1939 when you were first lady supported in testimony in front of the Senate Finance Committee a 25 percent tax on guns. You're not supporting that now or promoting that now."", 'How have you evolved over the years in terms of your support for the Second Amendment?', 'CLINTON: Well, I do support the Second Amendment. That has always been understood.', 'I just believe that, like any amendment to our Constitution, there are reasonable steps that can be taken. We have reasonable restrictions on certain kind of speech or certain forms of assembly. And for goodness sakes, we ought to be smart enough and do so consistent with the Constitution, to have more gun safety measures to try to save some of the 33,000 lives that we lose to gun violence every single year.', 'This is something that I have spoken out about, that I have advocated for right now. I think there is a consensus in the country on comprehensive background checks, closing the gun show loophole, closing the online and Charleston loopholes, reversing the immunity given to the gun industry, certainly prohibiting would-be terrorists on the no-fly zone from buying guns.', ""That's kind of the commonsense approach that we should be working to achieve."", 'DICKERSON: I would like to ask you about these stories out of Flint, Michigan. Lead levels in the water have created an emergency there. Senator Sanders called for Rick Snyder, the governor, to resign. What is your feeling?', 'CLINTON: Well, John, this is an issue I have been involved in now for a couple of weeks. I am horrified by what has happened in Flint.', 'I started calling for immediate action, calling for federal intervention. I sent two of my top campaign aides to meet with the mayor of Flint. As you may know, I appeared on a show this past week and demanded that Governor Snyder ask for the help that Michigan needs to deal with the horrible consequences that children and their families are facing in Flint.', ""And I saw that Governor Snyder turned around within two hours and finally asked for the help that he should have asked for some weeks ago. I don't want to get caught up in the political back and forth here. I want to help the people of Flint."", ""And I particularly want a comprehensive health analysis of what's happened to these children. Lead is a poison. It destroys your brain. It interferes with your learning and your behavior. Whatever it takes for Michigan and the federal government to come together, through FEMA, through Health and Human Services, the EPA, whatever it takes, we now have to fix the problem and help these kids and especially their health and education development probably for years to come."", ""DICKERSON: On the topic of health care back at the national level, you—your daughter, Chelsea Clinton, said that Senator Sanders' universal health care plan will dismantle Obamacare, dismantle Children's Health Insurance Program, and a series of other things it would dismantle."", ""Aren't—isn't she and your campaign not taking into account that those things would be replaced by an actual plan that Senator Sanders has put forward?"", ""CLINTON: Well, I think it's very confusing, because he hasn't put forward a plan."", ""And the only way we know what it is he's advocating for comes from looking at the nine bills that he's introduced in the House and Senate and Congress. And in those bills, every kind of health care is rolled all up together, and handed over to the states, which bear a financial responsibility to match what the federal government provides in order to administer health care."", ""So, it's not a traditional kind of single-payer system, as I understand it. It is a state-based system, kind of similar to Medicaid, if you will. And I do think there are very legitimate questions that can be raised, and because we don't have an up-to-date plan from Senator Sanders, all of us trying to figure out what it would mean for everybody to be put into that new system."", 'DICKERSON: All right.', ""Well, Senator—excuse me—Secretary Clinton, I know that will be debated this evening when you're on the stage with Senator Sanders."", 'We thank you for being with us.', 'CLINTON: Great to talk to you again, John.']"
34,            Hillary Clinton          ,"January 24, 2016","['TODD: This morning, there is some good news though for Clinton. She won the endorsement of the ""Des Moines Register"". By the way, as did Marco Rubio on the Republican side but one would argue the ""Des Moines Register"" will probably have a greater impact among Democratic caucus goers.', 'So joining me from Cedar Rapids, Iowa is the former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. Madam Secretary—welcome back.', ""CLINTON: Thank you—Chuck. It's good to talk to you this morning."", 'TODD: You got it.', 'Let me just start with this. Your opponent 74 years old, calls himself a socialist, started this campaign with next to zero name recognition. You have 38 of 44 U.S. senators endorsing, 12 of 18 Democratic governors. He has zero.', 'What happened? What\'s gone wrong? Save me the ""we always knew this was going to be a close race"" answer.', ""CLINTON: Well Chuck—look, I think it's actually good for the debate that we're having that there is so much interest and energy that I feel on my side and I know, obviously so does senator Sanders on his."", ""We have a big choice to make. And it's exciting. I had a great couple of events yesterday. I'm enthusiastically pursuing the opportunity to reach every single voter in Iowa and we're going to see what happens. I feel good about where we are. Obviously, we'll find out a week from tomorrow."", ""But if you look at the differences between Senator Sanders and myself, I just don't think we can't wait. We can't wait to make progress on the myriad of issues that I think we're going to be facing in the next administration. I want to build on the progress that President Obama has made and he has a different approach. And that's what voters are trying to determine, which they prefer."", 'TODD: Look, as you know, the caucuses sometimes are about passion, enthusiasm. Let me read you something that was in the ""New York Times"" from Gayle Collins. ""Nevertheless, you can\'t ignore the fact that Hillary Clinton is now the candidate of the aging Democratic establishment whose supporters pray for a low turnout on the Election Day. That might get her nominated in the long run but it\'s not really the kind of image that makes you go whistling into the election booth.""', 'By the way, she wrote that in 2008. By the way, she wrote that in 2008, Madam Secretary. Is there a deja vu happening here?', ""CLINTON: No, there isn't. I just have to tell you, can only react to what I'm doing, feeling, getting responses from people. And you know, I feel great that we have the level of enthusiasm that we do and we also have a really good team on the ground that has been working for months to make sure that it's not just here today, gone tomorrow. But people are involved. They are really reached out to and yes, we believe they're going to come caucus. So, you know, the speculation and all the rest of it is entertaining, I admit that. But we're just going to keep moving forward and do the work that we think is going to be successful on February 1st."", 'TODD: Are you worried that experience, your long resume, is not an asset in this wild year?', ""CLINTON: No, I'm really not. Because I think at the end of the day people take this vote seriously. They know they're voting for who they prefer to be the next president and commander in chief, and I believe that when I am out there talking with people about what we have to go up against here at home, get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top, begin to raise incomes, which hasn't happened, deal with health care, going from 90 percent coverage, which is what we have under the Affordable Care Act now, to 100 percent and I lay out what intend to do to get there."", ""I can only tell you they see people nodding. I know people are signing up as they leave my events. That's what matters here. It's very personal, and people look and they think, can we imagine this person to be president and commander in chief? And because of my experience, particularly my years as secretary of state working with President Obama, I think that's something that people really take into account."", ""TODD: What are you willing to—you know, it's interesting, your husband used a lot of political capital—you and your husband used a lot of political capital to do health care. President Obama, arguably, used all of his political capital to get health care passed."", ""What is it? What is the one issue you are going to be willing to use all your political capital to focus on? You and I both know you basically have one big shot at one big issue. What is it that you're willing to use all your political capital to do with?"", ""CLINTON: Well, Chuck, first of all, I don't agree with you on that. I think that there are several really important issues, health care being one of them. We've got to get costs down. I met a man on Friday who no longer can afford to pay for his HIV medication. I met a woman yesterday whose bill for the drugs she must take and has taken for 25 years has gone from a couple hundred to over $14,000 for the same amount of the drug."", ""That really hits my heart. I know what people are going through. I'm going to use whatever tools I can to get us lower prices, cap those prescription drug companies and take that on."", ""But I'm also going to focus on the economy because unless we create more jobs and get incomes rising and fix the tax system so that it doesn't in so many ways tilt toward the wealthy, people are not going to get ahead, they're not going to feel they're getting ahead and they're going to still believe that the government, the economy is rigged against them which is bad for our democracy. TODD: As you know, your opponent Senator Sanders has been hitting you on Wall Street contributions and including some paid speeches that you did for Goldman Sachs among other banks. Let me ask you this—why do you think one of these big banks paid you over $200,000 for a speech?"", ""CLINTON: Well, look, I gave speeches to a wide array of groups from health care groups to auto dealers and many, many more, and I think what they were interested in because what we talked about was the world coming off of four years as secretary of state in a complicated world, people were interested in what I saw, what I thought, they asked questions about matters that were on their minds. A lot of interest in the bin laden raid, how such a tough decision was made and what I advised the President. You know, I think Americans who are doing business in every aspect of the economy want to know more about the world. I actually think it's a good conversation for people to be having."", ""TODD: You don't think they expect anything in return?"", 'CLINTON: Absolutely not. You know, first of all, I was a senator from New York. I took them on when I was senator. I took on the carried interest loophole. I took on what was happening in the mortgage markets. I was talking about that in 2006. They know exactly where I stand.', ""And I'll tell you, Chuck, it's really interesting to me that now Karl Rove has taken money from the financial interest to run an ad against me to try to influence Democrats not to support me. Why? Ask yourself why."", 'Because he knows number one I know what must be done, and number two I know how to get it done to make sure that Wall Street writ large, not just the banks but the investment banks, the hedge funds and everybody else, no longer can wreck our economy the way they did in 2008.', 'TODD: All right. Two more quick questions.', 'The ""Des Moines Register"" editorial, in praising you and your experience, did bring up the e-mail issue as one of those things that they\'re frustrated with how you responded to it.', ""Let me just ask you this question. Last week you were asked about the FBI investigation. Are you concerned? You said you haven't been contacted by them. Are you concerned this investigation is taking too long? That it's putting an extra cloud over your candidacy and until it gets behind you, you're sort of going to have these issues and Michael Bloomberg even cited it as a reason why he's thinking about running."", ""CLINTON: No, I'm not concerned because I know what the facts are. I never sent or received any material marked classified. I cannot control what the Republicans leak and what they are contending. And I said it was interesting, Chuck—you'll as a political observer understand why. You know, back a couple of months ago Kevin McCarthy spilled the beans that the Benghazi investigation was all about bringing me down, something that I suspected but I went ahead, testified for 11 hours, answered all their questions, and even they admitted there was nothing new."", ""And now Senator Grassley shows up at a Trump rally yesterday in Iowa. He's the chairman of the judiciary committee who has—and his staff have been behind and pushing a lot of these stories, and announces he's there for the simple reason, to defeat me."", ""I can't control what the Republicans are doing. But I know what the facts are and I will just keep putting them out there. This is something that I think is very clear about what happened and I know it will be over and resolved at some point. But I can't control what the Republicans and their allies do. But I think it's important voters know what they're doing."", 'TODD: And Michael Bloomberg? Your reaction to his potential candidacy?', ""CLINTON: He's a good friend of mine, and I'm going to do the best I can to make sure that I get the nomination, and we'll go from there."", ""TODD: So you're not worried about him getting in?"", ""CLINTON: Well, the way I read what he said is if I didn't get the nomination he might consider it. Well, I'm going to relieve him of that and get the nomination so he doesn't have to."", ""TODD: All right. Madam Secretary—stay safe on the trail. We'll catch up with you soon."", 'CLINTON: Thank you. Good to talk to you.', 'TODD: Nice to talk with you.']"

I'll tell you, it was worth it, trying to get here. You have been so generous with your time. And I'm just so grateful to be back in Marshalltown and to have this chance to talk with you, now less than a week until the caucus on Monday night. But it's just really meaningful to me that you would be here and be part of this process, and I really am grateful to each and every one of you."", ""I've learned a lot in the last months, and I really think that spending all this time in small groups and big ones is going to make me a better president.

But I want to just spend a few minutes really discussing what's at stake, because this is one of the most consequential elections that we've had in quite some time."", 'When you think about it, there are some very big differences between us and the Republicans, and that puts a special responsibility on you and voters to try to decide where you stand. Well, I will tell you where I stand.', ""I believe that the Republican policies that are being promoted by this crop of candidates that are traveling across our state and country would set our country back, rip up the progress we've made, and undermine our future. And that is true across the board, but let me just pick a few of the most important issues. Let's take the economy."", ""You heard from them, they are spouting the same failed economic policies: trickle-down economics; cut taxes on the wealthy; get out of the way of corporations. We have tried that, it does not work. And it's important to know the facts. And the facts are that our economy does better when we have a Democrat in the White House who cares about creating jobs and raising incomes for Americans. [applause]"", ""And the last two Democratic presidents we've had, both of whom I know, which I kind of am proud of, they each inherited economic problems from their Republican predecessors."", 'You know, in my husband\'s case, it was a recession, a huge national debt that had been quadrupled in the prior 12 years and a big deficit. So when he got to Washington, people said, ""OK. So, what do you especially bring to Washington that can make a difference?"" He said, ""Well, I guess I bring arithmetic. We\'re going to make it add up again for the American people."" And at the end of eight years, we did.', 'Twenty-three million new jobs, but most importantly, incomes went up for everybody. Not just those at the top, hard-working middle-class families, working families, poor families. More people were lifted out of poverty than in any recent time in our history. And we ended up with a balanced budget and a surplus. We were on the right track.', 'Well, back came the Republicans and back came trickle-down economics. George W. Bush slashed taxes on the wealthy and got out of the way of corporations to the extent that the man he put in charge of keeping an eye on Wall Street took a chainsaw to a big stack of regulations and had a great big smile on his face.', ""Now we know what happened, don't we? We went into the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression, and when Barack Obama became president, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month. I don't think President Obama gets the credit he deserves for digging us out of that big ditch that the Republicans put us in during their administration. [applause]"", 'And it was not easy. I know; I talked to him about it. When he asked me to be secretary of State, he said, ""We got to focus on the economy here at home and we got to fix all the problems that we also inherited around the world.""', ""And what did he do? Well, we're back on track with 14 million new jobs. The Affordable Care Act was passed. We're now at 90 percent health care coverage in America for the first time. [applause]"", 'He passed and signed the toughest regulations on Wall Street since the 1930s, the Dodd-Frank law; saved the auto industry, which was on the brink of collapse which would have taken another, you know, couple of million jobs down with them. We ended up losing 9 million because of that Great Recession, 5 million homes were lost and $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.', ""Now, if you want to go back there, you got a lot of folks, including one who was here today, who are spouting that same stuff, because that's where we'll end up again. In fact, you are four times more likely to see a recession in America when you have a Republican in the White House."", ""So the economy is going to be at the core of this election. So you should ask everybody who's running what they're going to do about it. And I got to tell you, I'm proud of what we've been doing on the Democratic side. We have our differences, but we have differences over issues, and that's what we talk about, not insults, which is what happens among the Republicans."", ""So I've put out a plan. Here is what I think we need to do. We need more infrastructure jobs. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our rail systems, our sewer systems, our water systems. We have work to do in our country, and those are jobs that can't be exported, they need to be done right here and put Americans back to work building our economy, making us more competitive."", ""And then we're going to take the tax system and get rid of the incentives that actually encourage people to take jobs and move them overseas, take factories and build them overseas. We're going to reverse that so we start investing in America again, advance manufacturing. I know it can be done because I've been to some of your community colleges. I have seen the work that is happening there, the training that is going on."", ""I also know it can be done because while we are going to combat climate change, we're going to create more clean, renewable energy jobs.

""Well, I don\'t know, I\'m not a scientist."" You know, there\'s an easy way to remedy that. Go talk to a scientist, listen to a scientist, learn about what\'s going on. And, you know, that\'s bad enough that they\'re into denial. What really is troubling is they\'re missing this huge economic opportunity.', ""And when I tell people that, I see, you know, sometimes folks around the country have a little bit of skepticism on their faces, and here's what I tell them. I know we can create those jobs because look at what Iowa has done."", 'And I want you to thank Representative Smith. Thank you. And it started with Tom Vilsack and the Democrats making a commitment. Iowa now gets one-third of your electricity from renewable sources, mostly wind.', ""You have 7,000 people already working in the wind industry in this state. You are doing research on advanced biofuels that the Defense Department thinks may be able to fuel Navy vessels and Air Force planes. So Iowa is in the forefront of the energy revolution because some country is going to be the 21st century clean energy superpower. It's either going to be China, Germany, or us.

S lot of young people tell me they'd love to go into business, but they can't get credit. Part of it is they have such student debts they can't get credit; we've got to fix that. So we need to make it easier to start and grow a small business."", ""Now, there are two ways we can raise incomes real quick. One, we've got to raise the minimum wage.

I do not think it is right—[applause]—to be going to people who suffered because of the Republican recession and asking for you to help us make the investments for the future. I want you to take advantage of them, but I want to go where the money is, and the money is at the top, and that\'s where we need to be shifting our tax system. So we need to close the loopholes and the special gimmicks that corporations and the wealthy use, like this thing called the ""carried interest loophole"" that I\'ve been against for years.', ""We also need to do what Warren Buffett suggested. I was really very happy that he endorsed me, and I went to Omaha with him.

Now, there aren't very many of those, but there's a lot of money there because I want to use that money to make college affordable. I want to use that money to invest in clean energy. I want to use that money to move toward paid family leave so that families get more support to be able to do their work at home and take care of their families. I want to use that money to help bring down the cost of child care, which in some states is as expensive as college tuition. There are things we can do that will relieve the burdens on middle-class families, and the money should come from those who have it."", 'Now, people say to me, ""Well, how are we ever going to get that done?"" Well, I do have a political strategy. I\'ve seen a little bit of this in the last 20-plus years. There are not that many people who make $5 million or more in America, and I think we can make a very clear case.', ""Mr. Congressman over there, are you in favor of clean energy and affordable college? Are you in favor of early childhood education and the way we're going to get it is to tax the two people in your district who make more than $5 million?

And I want everybody to be able to look at that and make your own judgment."", 'I also have what has been described as the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan to go after Wall Street.', ""Now, I totally agree with my two esteemed opponents, Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley, that we've got to keep our eyes on the big banks. And no bank is too big to fail and no executive is too powerful to jail. But we already have the authority to go after them. That was in the Dodd-Frank bill. We don't have to do that, we just have to implement it. And I have said if they pose a systemic risk to our economy, I will go after them and I will use the process President Obama signed into law."", ""But here's where I differ with my two friends—that is not enough. And this is what we've been arguing about on the debate stage. You see it wasn't just the big banks that caused our problems, it was an investment bank like Lehman Brothers. It was a big insurance conglomerate called AIG. It was a mortgage company called Countrywide. It was another bank, not one of the big five, called Wachovia, and others who are in what is called the shadow banking sector."", ""So what I've is we're going after risk wherever it is in the financial system. And Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, said I have the best plan. Barney Frank, who is actually the Frank in Dodd-Frank, said I have the best plan because I'm trying to look not just at what happened in the past to prevent that from happening again, but what could happen in the future."", ""And you know, the best evidence I have that I have the best plan is that the Republicans and their billionaire allies are running ads against me. You know, it started a few weeks ago. These two hedge fund billionaires formed a super PAC to run ads against me to convince Democrats not to support me. And then along came Karl Rove, you know, the errand boy for the billionaires, and he's now running an ad against me. And now another billionaire has jumped in, and he's now running an ad against me."", 'Now you got to stop to think, why are they spending all this money to try to convince Democrats not to support me? Well, I think you know the answer, because they know that I say what I mean, I do what I say I will do, and I know how to get it done, to take after them, to prevent them from—[applause]—pushing an agenda on us that hurts the economy.', ""Now, another area where I have very strong feelings and share exactly the same goal as Senator Sanders is health care. You know, I believe in universal health care coverage. Every American should have it. You know, before it was called Obamacare it was called Hillarycare back in '93 and '94 when I was trying to get universal health care, and we were not successful. And that was really disappointing."", ""I mean, the drug companies, the insurance companies spent millions of dollars against us. So we didn't succeed. And then I got to thinking, well, what can I do now? Because, you know, my view is when you're knocked down, you share the human experience because everybody gets knocked down about something. The real question is whether you get back up. So I started thinking, what can I do that can help somebody make a difference in their lives."", 'And I remembered when I was traveling around the country trying to get universal health care, meeting so many people who did not have health insurance, they couldn\'t afford it, they had a pre-existing condition and the insurance companies wouldn\'t give it to them. And I met so many really good, decent people who are so overwhelmed by what was happening to them. And I remember I was at the Children\'s Hospital in Cleveland. I was meeting with a group of parents whose kids were really sick with chronic diseases. And one man said to me, he said, ""You know, I\'ve gone everywhere to try to get insurance for my daughters. I have two girls with cystic fibrosis, and nobody will sell it to me.""', ""I said what do they say when you go ask them and you tell them you want to try to pay for something? They say no. He said, I'll tell you what the last person told me at the insurance company I visited. He said, we don't insure burning houses. This man said, they called my little girls burning houses. And that stuck with me, that and the stories I heard. So I started to work with Democrats and Republicans and we created the Children's Health Insurance Program, and it now insures eight million kids because when you get—[applause]—you encounter an obstacle, you run into a problem, you've got to keep going. You can't ever stop if you're trying to accomplish something that will help other people. And I was thrilled when the president passed and signed the Affordable Care Act."", ""We've been trying to get that—the Democratic party has been trying to get that accomplished since Harry Truman. And now, I meet people all the time who are benefiting from it. I want to build on it and I want to improve it. You know, the Republicans want to repeal it, and that's what they'll do if they get the White House back. We can't let that happen."", 'Here is what I want to do. I want to decrease costs, out-of-pocket costs; decrease prescription drug costs. [applause]', ""I want to make sure that we get the authority for Medicare to negotiate for lower drug costs with the drug companies. I want to go after the predatory pricing that drug companies are using to raise the price of drugs. I want to take away their tax benefits. They actually get a tax benefit for advertising all that stuff on TV to us that we never—I can't understand what they're talking about."", ""They have people walking through fields of wildflowers, walking on beaches. They have the name of the drug which, you know, is unpronounceable. And then in a low voice, under the music, they have somebody saying if you take this drug, you know, your nose will fall off. I mean, it—[laughter]—drives you crazy. And they spend more money advertising on TV than they spend on research. So we're going to go right at them. We're going to take them on on this."", ""But I don't want to start over, my friends. That's the disagreement I have with Senator Sanders. I want us to build on what we have and make it better, and go from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent of Americans. I don't want to start at zero and have to—[applause]—fight it all over again, have to have the national battle we that we had on health care over the last 25 years. So I'm determined that we're going to make this work for everybody, and I know it's the right thing to do. And I hope that, you know, we will be able to get your costs down, your co-pays, your deductibles, what, you know, a lot of people are telling me are starting to pinch again."", ""I also will defend Social Security against privatization. The Republicans still want to privatize it. They're still talking about that. It's a terrible idea. And you know the worst part of the idea is they want to turn the entire Social Security trust fund over to Wall Street. That's what this is all about. Take all that money that people have been paying in for, you know, 75, 80 years and turn it over to Wall Street. I will never let that happen. That is the worst—[applause]—idea that is imaginable."", ""I will also not let them voucherize Medicare, something else they want to do, and I will not let them privatize the VA. We have to fix the VA, but we are not going to take away guaranteed benefits from our veterans who have earned them through their service. That's not going to happen. [applause]"", ""And when it comes to foreign policy and national security, well, I think we have a lot to do to keep our country safe, and I have some ideas that I've been putting out based on what I did in the Senate after 9/11, based on my work as secretary of State."", ""It's imperative that we do everything we can to defeat ISIS, to stop the flow of foreign fighters and funding to fight them on the Internet where they're quite effective without putting American troops back on the ground in either Syria or Iraq. [applause]"", ""That will not happen. It's not—it's not going to happen on my watch. And then we have to do a better job working with federal, state, and local law enforcement to keep us safe at home, and we have to do a better job sharing intelligence, getting intelligence that will help us prevent attacks."", ""When I was a senator after 9/11, I'd be kept up-to-date on all the threats that still were facing New York, and we had a very, very dedicated group of police and federal law enforcement and everyone who worked together. But, you know, one of the best things we did was a campaign which said, If you see something suspicious or you hear something suspicious, report it. And so people were picking up the phone and telling the police or maybe calling the FBI, and it really provided kind of the—the eyes-on help that we needed. And people could then follow up, and we prevented attacks. We foiled attacks."", ""Well, the reason I mention that is because of this. The Republican candidates, led by their frontrunner, have been attacking Muslims, right? You've heard that, attacking American Muslims, attacking Muslims around the world. That's not only shameful, it's dangerous. We need everybody in this country to be on the same team when it comes to preventing terrorist attacks. [applause]"", ""And we need people who are in the community who hear something, see something to report it and not feel like they're being demonized, defamed, insulted, pushed out. And certainly, if we're going to defeat ISIS, we need a coalition that includes Muslim nations."", ""Now, I can tell you I built the coalition that imposed sanctions on Iran. I know a little bit about how you do this. You don't start by insulting people's religion and then ask them to be part of your effort to defeat a common adversary. [applause]"", ""That's not the way it works in the real world. So we have to be smart about how we protect ourselves, and that will be my highest priority."", 'I also want to continue to move toward comprehensive immigration reform, which I think is in the best interest of our country and our economy. [applause]', 'And I want to let you know where I stand on a lot of the issues that the Republicans have taken positions on because they seem to be against so many of the fundamental rights that I support.', ""I am for a woman's right—a woman's right to make her own health decisions, and I am against defunding Planned Parenthood. [applause]"", 'I am for marriage equality and against discrimination against the LGBT community. I am against Citizens United, which is a terrible decision that has opened the doors to floods of unaccountable money from the Koch Brothers and others. And I would do everything I can to reverse that decision.', ""I also want to keep pushing for criminal justice reform and reform in the incarceration system. And I want to fight for common sense gun safety measures that will help keep— [applause] —Americans safe without infringing on gun owners' rights."", ""We are a smart—we are a smart people. We can do this. And what I don't understand is how when we know we have, on average, 90 people a day dying from gun violence, 33,000 people a year, we cannot figure out how to protect people, protect first-graders going to school, people going to a movie theater, churchgoers going to Bible study. We can do this. We can't stop every murder or every suicide or every tragic, avoidable accident, but we can stop a lot of them without infringing on anybody's rights."", 'And 92 percent of the American people agree with that, and 85 percent of gun owners agree with that. So we need somebody who will stand up to the gun lobby and stop them from intimidating common sense reforms in our country. [applause]', ""So we have a lot of work to do, my friends. And you have been really patient. The children who are still here have been especially patient, and I don't want to keep you any longer."", 'I just want to say a few closing comments, and then for those of you who want to stay, I will shake your hands and take pictures and you can ask me questions.

I worked with Republicans as first lady, as senator, as secretary of State. I worked to get results for the people I represented in the Senate as well as our country. I worked when I was secretary of State to make our country safe and to have our values and interests promoted. And I know how to find common ground because I've done it."", ""I don't think that—I think I—I do believe that probably every Republican I served with at one time or another sponsored a piece of my legislation. Actually, when I'm not running for something, they say nice things about me.

You know, I am the granddaughter of a factory worker, she is the granddaughter of a former president. I think it shouldn't matter. The grandchildren of everybody should have the same opportunities in our country. [applause]"", ""And that's what I am going to stand up for and fight for.

Donald Trump is not going to debate on Fox tomorrow night. Will you debate on our debate? Will you show up?"", ""CLINTON [via telephone]: Look, Chris, what I've said through my campaign is that I would look forward to another debate. I am, you know, anxious, if we can get something set up, to be able to be there. And so let's try to make it happen."", ""MATTHEWS: Well, someone has to lead from the front. Will you be there, no matter what? Will you show up and wait and see? Will you be there waiting for Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley? Would you, in other words, lead the pack in showing up and committing to doing that?"", ""CLINTON: Look, I'm ready for the debate, and I hope Senator Sanders will change his mind and join us. And I think the DNC and the campaign should be able to work this out. I've said for — you know, for a long time that I'd be happy to have more debates, and I hope we can get this done."", ""MATTHEWS: Well, if he doesn't show up, will you?"", ""CLINTON: Well, let's hope that we can get it worked out. I don't want to — you know, I don't want to jump the gun and create more problems for everybody trying to get this worked out, so we can all come to agreement that the voters of New Hampshire and America deserve to see us, you know, debating before the New Hampshire primary."", ""MATTHEWS: So you won't be there — just a last question on this. You won't be there unless Bernie's there."", ""CLINTON: Well, I'm not committing to that, either, Chris. I think we should have another debate. I think people want it. They have called for it. Folks have moved forward trying to get it set up. We've got, you know — look, 24 hours in a political campaign is an eternity."", 'MATTHEWS: Right.', ""CLINTON: We've got a little time to try to get everybody on board, which would certainly be my preference."", 'MATTHEWS: OK, you believe candidates should have the courage to face each other before the — before the caucuses, in other words. You think you should be there and he should be there.', ""CLINTON: I do. I think that — you know, I agreed, we all agreed to go with the process that the DNC had set up. And you know, I've been saying for a while that if they come up with more debates, I will be there. And now we've got a real, live possibility, and I — I personally think it would be great for the — you know, the primary. We're moving into the caucus, as you know so well, on Monday."", 'MATTHEWS: OK...', 'CLINTON: And then once we come out of there, whatever happens, we should agree to debate in New Hampshire.', ""MATTHEWS: In other words, you're sticking to your commitment, I will be there."", ""CLINTON: I will — I will debate. Now, as I say, I'd want — I want all the campaigns and the DNC to agree. That is my preference."", 'MATTHEWS: OK.', ""CLINTON: That's what we've tried to, you know, do in our side of the ledger here."", 'MATTHEWS: OK.', ""CLINTON: And I'm pushing people to come to agreement so we can all get out there and debate before the New Hampshire primary."", 'MATTHEWS: Well, this is getting very sharply worded as we get closer to the caucuses. The word in ""The New York Times"" this morning, Madam Secretary, is that Senator Sanders is readying an attack ad against you. We don\'t know whether he\'s going to use it, but the language is basically that you\'re in hock to Wall Street because of the speaking fees you\'ve taken from Goldman Sachs. How do you respond or how will you respond to an eleventh-hour attack like that?', ""CLINTON: Well, first, it's really disappointing, Chris. You know, Senator Sanders has started to get increasingly personal with his attacks. He even compared me to Dick Cheney last week, which, you know, is kind of a low blow. So it would be another escalation and a breaking of his pledge not to go negative. One of the things that I think has been great about the Democratic side is we really have focused on issues, while the Republicans have been hurling insults. And I think the people in Iowa want to go to the caucuses thinking about which one of us as president can actually make a difference in their lives, and that's the case I've been focused on making. So you know, it would be a sharp departure by Senator Sanders. And you know, the other part of this, is anybody who knows me knows you can't buy me. I mean, honestly, I've been standing up and fighting and getting knocked around for years, trying to get things done that I think would improve people's lives. And I'm not going to stop, and that includes anybody trying to, you know, mess with our financial system."", ""MATTHEWS: Well, when he uses phrases like — dark phrases like, You can draw your own conclusions, as to whether you're in hock to Goldman Sachs or anyone — is that — is that a low blow, You can draw your own conclusions?"", ""CLINTON: Well, I think he's trying to go to the line without going over it. And you know, clearly, some of the journalists covering us are starting to notice and call him out on it. But I feel very — you know, very positive and energized by what I'm seeing happening here in Iowa. And I know that I have the best plan to rein in Wall Street abuses, to make sure it doesn't ever happen again. Lots of folks, from Barney Frank to Paul Krugman, have said that's the case because I don't just go after the big banks. You know, we already have the authority to do that under Dodd-Frank, and I have said I would use that authority if they were posing a systemic risk to our economy. But equally importantly, we've got to go after the shadow banking sector. You know, let's not forget Lehman Brothers, AIG, Countrywide, Rapovia. And let's also remind people, Chris, that, clearly, the billionaires, as Bernie likes to say — the billionaires have chosen sides. They're running ads against me and trying to, you know, kind of hoodwink Democrats into voting against me because they know exactly what I will do because they've seen me in action. So whether it's, you know, Karl Rove or the hedge fund guys with their own super-PAC, or Joe Ricketts jumping in now with a kind of ham-handed effort to look like he was, you know, going against Bernie, when the real point was to, you know, stir opposition to me. I take that as perversely flattering and as the single best refutation of what Senator Sanders is trying to imply."", ""MATTHEWS: Well, you're giving us a real rogue's gallery here of Dick Cheney and Karl Rove. [laughter]"", ""Anyway, let me ask you about the slogans. You used a phrase the other day, these shouting slogans. Now, I know what you mean — I'm going to build a wall across the Rio Grande — across — along the Rio Grande River. I'm going to make the Mexicans pay for it. But on the Democratic side, Senator Sanders says things like free health care, or rather, government-paid health care for life, as a right. He talks about free tuition when you go to a great school like Berkeley or Madison, Wisconsin. Free! Free! Is that what you mean, this — we had a young guy on yesterday from South Carolina who switched from you to Senator Sanders, and he — I went through this list of free things and I said, Where's the money come from? And he says, Well, we put a man on the moon. We can do this. And that kind of fantastic — what do you call it — appeal. And then I heard from Sanders the other day that they're going to stay left, right to the general, they're not going to make any appeal to the middle. How do you beat somebody who promises to go hard left, right to November, and offers all this stuff to people who are 20 years old, 22 years old, and they don't have to pay much taxes now, but you say, Look, you're going to get free — no more tuition bills, no more bills! You're going to have no health care the rest of your life, so forget having to buy insurance. It's a pretty good offer. Is that what you mean by shouting slogans?"", 'CLINTON: Well, I was really more referring to the Republicans, as you pointed out initially. And I have been, you know, pointing out the differences in the approach between myself and Senator Sanders because I know that it\'s more important we actually make progress than fall back into gridlock. And let\'s take health care as an example. You know, we\'ve been trying, as Democrats, since Harry Truman to get on the path to universal coverage. Before it was called ""Obama care,"" it was called ""Hillary care,"" and I have the scars to prove it. And I was thrilled when President Obama passed and signed the Affordable Care Act. We are now at 90 percent coverage. I sure think we ought to improve it. I\'ve got plans to get the costs down and make sure we do go after high prescription drug costs and some of the other drivers of health care costs. But I think it\'s a lot smarter to try to go from 90 percent to 100 percent than to throw our country into another contentious debate about health care. Where\'s the money going to come from? Who\'s going to be paying it? If you have health care you like, if you\'re under a private plan, do you have to give it up? If you\'re on Medicare and you work, do you have to pay more taxes? All these questions that would be thrown back into the public arena and we\'d have to start all over again from 0 to 100 percent. I just think we want to stay on the path of making progress. Now, some people, you know, say, Oh my gosh, that\'s so pragmatic. It\'s not, you know, soaring, or whatever they say. Well, I\'m out there talking to people who prescription drug costs have gone up from $200 to $14,000. I\'m talking to people whose insulin cost has gone up three times. That\'s not a new drug. That doesn\'t have any new research in it. I\'m talking to people who are thanking me for the Affordable Care Act because the lifetime limit, the cap has been lifted. And a man yesterday in Davenport said to me, I\'m so grateful because I\'ve got a granddaughter with a congenital heart condition. These people can\'t wait, Chris. We can\'t wait for another big debate that promises, you know, the sky when we know we\'ve got to deliver on the ground. We\'ve got to help people deal with the problems, the issues, the challenges they\'re facing right now. We have to restore faith that our government can work. And that is what I intend to do as president, and I\'m going to keep fighting for that. And I respect the goal because Senator Sanders and I share the same goal. We want to get to universal coverage. I think my way will get us there faster and provide the health care that the people here in Iowa are telling me they are desperately, desperately in need of.', ""MATTHEWS: Last question, and it's so important to this campaign. I think so. I know you think so. It has to do with history. And it's not the only issue in the campaign, obviously, but if you look at the American Constitution — and you've studied constitutional law — and the fact is that it wasn't until after the civil war that African-American men were given the right to vote in the 15th Amendment. And then women didn't get it until after the First World War. There's a long lag there. Obama was elected president. You might get elected president. You may well get elected president. Do you think it's — you think young American women — say, young women in college, 18 to 22, 23 — do they get it, how long this struggle has been and the fact that it's a precarious struggle that could fall back? Do they know that all the rights to choice, to equality at workplace, where they do get it, all were fought for? Do they get it? That's my simple question. I don't know if they do. Do you think they get it?"", ""CLINTON: Look, I think that a lot of young people — and I wouldn't limit it to women. I think young people of every background, every racial, ethnic, religious background, are, you know, trying to understand how best they can participate in our political system and what the stakes are for them. And of course, you know, if you haven't been through a lot of these struggles, it's easy either not to know about them or to think they didn't go far enough or that, you know, everything is taken care of. So we've got the two extremes of the argument. But here's what I'm hearing, at least from the young women who come to see me. They say, Hey, OK, you're for equal pay. What are you going to make sure I get it? I had a young woman the other day here in Iowa say, I want to go to law school. How can I be sure that if I work hard and do well and get a job, I'm going to get equal pay? And I said, OK, that's the right question because we've been fighting for this. We've made progress, but not near enough. Here's exactly what I think we need to do to get it. Or young women who say, you know, I can't balance family and work. I had a young woman come to see me holding her 9-month-old baby and she said, you know, I can't go back to work until I get my baby stabilized. I need paid family leave. What are you going to do about it? So I think what's happening is, as the campaign goes on, a lot of young people — and let's focus on young women — are moving from the sort of general, either we haven't gone far enough or those fights are over and I don't have to worry about it, to being much more specific. And that is a good development because at the end of our efforts here in the primaries, and if I'm so fortunate enough to get the nomination, then I think we fight out an election between a party that believes we've got to continue to address the lacks in our drive for equality, our drive for justice, whether it's racism, sexism, homophobia, you name it — we need to address those gaps, and the other side doesn't even want to admit they exist. So I think we're going to have a very positive reaction in the general election between, you know, the big deniers on the Republican side, and you know, Let's make progress, get things done, on my side."", 'MATTHEWS: Thank you so much. One last — just to clarify what you said about the debate. Would you like the chairman — the chair of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, to approve the MSNBC/NBC debate next week?', 'CLINTON: I would like the chairmen of the party and the campaigns to agree that we can debate in New Hampshire next week.', 'MATTHEWS: OK.', ""CLINTON: That is what I'm hoping will happen."", ""MATTHEWS: OK.

Are you confident that won\'t happen again?', ""CLINTON: Well, George, here's what I'm confident about. We've run a terrific campaign from the grassroots up. I feel so proud and grateful to the thousands of Iowans who have joined this campaign. And we're going to keep working as hard as I can and everybody else, until the caucuses conclude tomorrow night. Of course, it's close. It's competitive. That's why I hope everybody who has decided to caucus for me will be sure to come out on Monday night."", ""STEPHANOPOULOS: You did have that surprise on Friday; the State Department saying they will not release 22 emails of yours deemed top secret. You want them released. Why are you so confident that release would not compromise national security? What do you know about those emails that we don't?"", ""CLINTON: Well, here's what I know. I know that this is, I think, a continuation of the story that has been playing out for months. There is no classified marked information on those emails sent or received by me. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, who's had a chance to review them, has said that this email chain did not originate with me and that there were no classification markings. So I do want them released and of course I can't be clear about exactly what the reasons might be for some in the government, as part of this interagency dispute, to make this request not to make them public. But I would like to see them disclosed and I think they can. It should be disclosed —"", '[crosstalk]', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: Your supporters —', ""CLINTON: — that I'm told about them."", ""STEPHANOPOULOS: — your supporters including Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, former governor of Iowa, and Senator Feinstein herself, has suggested it's political. Is that what you think?"", ""CLINTON: Well, it's — I'm going to leave that to others who are quite experienced in the ways of Washington to comment on. I just have to point out that the timing and some of the leaks that have led up to it are concerning. And I just want this matter resolved. The best way to resolve is to do what I asked months ago, release these, let the public see them and let's move on."", ""STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, you've said many times that the emails were not marked classified. No evidence that that's not true. But the non-disclosure agreement you signed as secretary of state said that that really is not that relevant. It says classified information is marked or unmarked classified and that all of your training to treat all of that sensitively and should know the difference."", ""CLINTON: Well, of course. And that's exactly what I did. I take classified information very seriously. You know, you can't get information off the classified system in the State Department to put onto an unclassified system, no matter what that system is. We were very specific about that and you — when you receive information, of course, there has to be some markings, some indication that someone down the chain had thought that this was classified and that was not the case. The final thing I would say because clearly the best answer to all of this is release and disclose these materials is that what I'm told is that this chain of emails very well included a published newspaper report. That seems a little hard to understand, that we would be retroactively over classifying a public newspaper article. So let's just get it out. Let's see what it is and let the American people draw their own conclusions. This is very much like Benghazi, George. You know, the Republicans are going to continue to use it, beat up on me. I understand that. That's the way they are. But after 11 hours of testimony, answering every single question, in public, which I have requested for many months, I think it's pretty clear they're grasping at straws and this will turn out —"", '[crosstalk]', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: Finally on this matter, you know, a few months back, you told my colleague, David Mir it was a mistake to set up this private server. Yet just this Monday, you said there was no error in judgment. How do you square those two statements?', ""CLINTON: Well, look, as I've said many times, it was permitted. My predecessors had engaged in a similar practice. It was not the best choice. I wouldn't be here talking to you about it. I'd be talking about what people in Iowa are talking to me about, about affordable health care and jobs and rising wages and all of the concerns that are on their minds. And be, you know, really able to answer their questions as I have been now for so many months."", 'STEPHANOPOULOS: You and Senator Sanders really going at it right now. And here was — he was on the stump there yesterday, saying this about your attack.', '[begin video clip]', ""SANDERS: Don't tell me that I'm defending or protecting the gun lobby. Don't tell me I'm attacking Planned Parenthood. Those are inaccuracies. And we can do better than that."", '[end video clip]', ""STEPHANOPOULOS: He's calling you on this, says he got a D- rating from the NRA and 100 percent record with Planned Parenthood."", ""CLINTON: Well, let me tell you what the people who work on these issues every day have said. They say I'm the leader. I'm the leader who has taken on tough issues. I've taken on difficult issues like Planned Parenthood, the gun lobby, for many years. And they concluded to endorse me by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. I was very honored to have that. That's not saying that others haven't voted with them. But they were looking for a leader and they found it with me. I've been endorsed by The Brady Campaign and yesterday in a very emotional event in Ames, Iowa, endorsed by Gabby Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, because they believe I'm the leader that they want to stand up to the gun lobby, the same with the Human Rights Campaign. They concluded I was the leader to protect and advance the cause of the rights of the LGBT community. Now that is just the facts. People who have known us, people who have evaluated us, people who have concluded what they want in the next president have sided with me. And I'm very proud of that."", ""STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, you just mentioned [inaudible] hitting you with the email issue. They're clearly going to hit Bernie Sanders with the fact that he's a Democratic socialist if he gets the nomination. Some of your supporters concerned about that, Senator Claire McCaskill, are saying they can't wait to run an ad with a hammer and a sickle. Steny Hoyer, Congressman Steny Hoyer, saying he calls himself a socialist. I don't think that's a good title to be running for President of the United States. Is that what you think? Will the fact that he's a Democratic socialist make it harder for Democrats to win in November?"", ""CLINTON: Well, that certainly is what a lot of Democratic leaders are saying. And I take them at their word. They know their states. They know the country. They know we have to take back the Senate. They want to make some advances in the House as well as at governor and legislature levels across the country. Here's what I think. I think I've been subjected, as you know so well, to years of scrutiny and I'm still standing, talking to you in the lead here in Iowa for the caucuses and going on after that. And it's a very tough gantlet to run. And if there are issues, that Republicans and their allies on the Right believe they could use to bring down a Democratic, they're going to use it. I feel vetted. I feel ready. I feel strong and I think I'm the best person to be the nominee and to defeat whoever they nominate in November."", ""STEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, I wonder what your response to this quote from your old friend, Robert Rice, Secretary of Labor under President Clinton. He said you're the most qualified candidate for the political system we now have. But Bernie Sanders is the most qualified candidate to create the political system we should have. How do you respond to that?"", ""CLINTON: Well, look, I'm a progressive who thinks it's important to actually make progress. That's what I've done my entire life. That's what I will do as president. Obviously I have big goals. I want to get to universal coverage; I want to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. Get incomes rising, get women equal pay, raise the minimum wage, have a renaissance in manufacturing, move toward clean, renewable energy — I have big goals. And I tell you how I'm going to get there and how I'm going to pay for them. And I think that is what the Americans want. I'm not going to sit here and overpromise and under-deliver. I'm going to tell you what I know we can achieve, and that's going to take the political system we have right now, and then I intend to bring in more people, as always have, George. When I ran for Senate the first time, you remember, you know, people didn't give me much of a chance. I won and then when I was reelected, I won with a bigger percentage. And then when I was Secretary of State, even the Republicans said I was doing a good job. So I understand politics. I understand a campaign. I am focused on my mission to make sure this country works for everybody, particularly hardworking middle-class families who rightly feel they've been left out and left behind. I think I know how to do that, and I think the voters know that I know how to do that."", 'STEPHANOPOULOS: Secretary Clinton, thanks for joining us this morning.', 'CLINTON: Great to talk to you, George.

Thank you so much for doing that. And so do you have the victory party all set for tonight?"", ""CLINTON: Well, this is a very tight race, Robin. It's really going down to the wire. But we feel very good, we've worked so hard. I've had a great operation here. So many young people, organizers who fanned out across the state, the thousands of volunteers. We did knock on 125,000 doors this past weekend. So we're very committed, very energized and enthusiastic, but it all depends upon who shows up tonight, who comes out to caucus in Iowa. And I'm urging everyone who is interested in, committed to caucusing for me to please be there tonight, 6:30. I will be there in spirit, because if you stand up for me, I will stand up for you during this campaign and into the White House."", ""ROBERTS: You know, there are so many similarities between what is going on right now and eight years ago. You again are affected — unexpected challenge that you are facing. What are the differences and similarities between what you're experiencing now and what happened eight years ago here in Iowa?"", ""CLINTON: Well, I think that I have a much better organization, to be just really clear about it. I think that we built an organization using a lot of the lessons learned, and we recruited some of the best people that you could find anywhere in the country working in Democratic politics. I think I'm a better candidate. I think that in addition to just knowing more about the caucus process and what we needed to do to build toward this night. My experience as secretary of State really deepened and intensified my understanding about what the next president will have to face. So all in all, I feel like it's a different energized effort that is really bringing in people from across the state and, indeed, across the country who know what's at stake in this election, understand how really dramatic and drastic it would be if the Republicans were to take back the White House because they would rip out the progress. We wouldn't be able to, in my view, get the economy going for everybody, get incomes rising, get affordable college, take care of the rising prescription drug costs, everything I'm talking about, which is really in response to the concerns and the worries that I hear from people as I criss-cross this state."", ""ROBERTS: All 99 counties you have criss-crossed, and we have seen you and we've seen your husband and we've seen your daughter as well. [laughter]"", ""CLINTON: Well, I haven't gotten to all 99."", 'ROBERTS: A third of —', ""CLINTON: I had to — let's just say that. I don't want anybody to think that my silence is affirmation. But I've covered a lot of ground and I sure have met many thousands of people and have really learned so much. You know, that's the best part of this. It's obviously exhausting, it takes a lot of concentration. But what keeps me going are the stories that people tell me. There's something so intimate, at least in my experience because I actually try to listen to people and hear what's on their minds when someone tells you about the open heart surgery that their granddaughter had to have as a baby and how they couldn't have afforded it without the Affordable Care Act, or when a young woman says she's just drowning in student debt and needs a way out, that sticks with me. And I think that the months I've spent here listening to Iowans has really made me a better candidate and I think it will make me a better president."", ""ROBERTS: Well, speaking of listening to Iowans, we have John Karl. He is out and about, and he is with some voters. And, you know, a third of voters here are undecided, and let's hear what one voter has to ask you. John?"", ""JONATHAN KARL: Hello, Robin, hello Secretary Clinton. We're with Rob here from Dennison, Iowa. Incredible thing about this. Rob, you were undecided between Hillary Clinton and John Kasich. So you don't even know which party — what's your question for Secretary Clinton?"", ""QUESTION: Good morning, Secretary Clinton. My question for you is as a liberal Republican — it seems to be a dying breed anymore — I want to know how you're going to work bipartisanly with a very partisan Congress and a — and a seemingly polarized nation."", 'KARL: Good question.', ""CLINTON: That's a — that's a really great question, and thanks for asking it because I get asked that a lot. You know, I have a record of working with Republicans. When I'm actually in a position to do so — when, you know, there's a campaign, it's a little bit different — but when I was first lady, I worked to achieve the Children's Health Insurance Program, working across the aisle with both Republicans and Democrats, even reformed our foster care and adoption system, teaming up with Tom DeLay, a very partisan Republican in the House. And when I got to the Senate, I worked hard to get health care for the National Guard and Reserves, I worked with Senator Lindsey Graham in that case. And I — I don't know that there was a single Republican who didn't co-sponsor one of the bills that I worked on. And as secretary of State, I had similar efforts to reach common ground that proved successful. I know in a campaign that distinctions have to be drawn because we have to give voters a real sense of what each of us wants to do, and to hold us accountable for the agenda we put forth. But I am confident that I'm going to work really hard to find that common ground across the aisle, and we will make progress together."", 'ROBERTS: Secretary Clinton, thank you very much.

How are you feeling and how do you plan to spend the next 12 hours?', ""CLINTON: I am feeling great. I am so proud of the campaign we have run here in Iowa. I've got the most dedicated campaign team, the organizers who have been on the ground, the thousands of volunteers. We actually knocked on 125,000 doors this weekend. So there is just a lot of excitement and energy. I'm urging everybody to come out and caucus tonight to be part of this unique American process. I hope they will come out and caucus for me."", ""CAMEROTA: So, Secretary, let's talk about the issue that has bedeviled your campaign. That, of course, is the ongoing investigation into your e-mails. On Friday, the State Department withheld 22 e-mails. They didn't release them. Because of material deemed top secret. I know you have been asked this six ways to Sunday along the campaign trail and I know that you've always said there is nothing there, but your opponents have said that this is big. It's is a big deal. How do you convince voters today not to be concerned about this?"", ""CLINTON: Well, Alisyn, there is nothing new. And I think the facts are quite helpful here. It's a little bit like what the Republicans and others have tried to do with respect to Benghazi. Just a lot of innuendo, a lot of attacks. I just know that after I testified for 11 hours, answered every question, nothing new came up. Most voters have made up their minds. And I'm grateful for that. The same here. And I think most of the voters who have followed this know exactly what's going on here. I never made any different explanation than the one that I have made over and over again. I take classified information seriously. I did not send or receive any material marked classified and I want all of these released. This is a dispute about retroactive classification, quite a mouthful. So what people talk to me about is how I'm going to get incomes up, how I'm going to make sure the Affordable Care Act works, and get prescription drug costs down, and make college affordable and relieve student debt. That's what's on voters' minds. And that's what I'm talking about and that seems to be what is exciting and energizing people as they move toward the caucus tonight."", 'CAMEROTA: Um but Secretary Clinton, something does seem to be happening with this investigation, or at least the FBI seems to be talking about it more, because in the past week several media outlets have said that their sources in the FBI say, quote, ""something\'s going to happen."" What does that mean to you?', ""CLINTON: It means people are selectively leaking and making comments that have no basis in anything I'm aware of. And, you know, I regret that that seems to be part of the atmosphere because we need to let this inquiry run its course, get it resolved. But I can tell you, Alisyn, that is not on the minds of the literally thousands of people that I have seen in the last few weeks. And I'm glad it isn't. Because the facts are the facts. No matter how much selective leaking or anonymous sourcing and all that kind of stuff that goes on, what people want to know is what I can do to be the best possible president for them and their families. And I've been thrilled at the kind of reaction and response I've been getting, the crowds that we had. That last event last night was just overwhelming. I'm looking forward to people coming out expressing their opinion about who can be the best president and commander in chief for the Democratic Party and then getting on to win the Democratic nomination and being successful next November."", 'CAMEROTA: Yesterday ""The New York Times"" endorsed you. They wrote that you are the right choice in terms of experience and vision. I\'m sure that was music to your ears. Do you think ""The New York Times"" endorsement plays in Iowa?', 'CLINTON: Well, I don\'t know. But I know ""The Des Moines Register"" does and they endorsed me. I know ""The Boston Globe"" matters and a lot of the newspapers in New Hampshire that have endorsed me and this is very gratifying because, yeah, there is a lot of static that goes on and the Republicans and their allies are determined to do everything they can to try to bring me down. They don\'t know me very well. Because I don\'t quit when I\'m fighting for what I believe in. And I believe that I can be the president who makes progress with people. And I\'m just going to stick with it. And so when very respectable and responsible outlets like ""The Register"" or ""The Times"" or ""The Boston Globe"" and others look at all the candidates, interview us, ask us really hard questions and conclude that I\'m their choice for president, I find that incredibly validating. And I do hope that voters pay attention to it because it\'s a pretty tough vetting process they go through.', ""CAMEROTA: Secretary Clinton, that's talk about the Republicans and what's going on in terms of how the electorate feels. I know that you know that this campaign has been about how angry and how anxious people are feeling out there and of course all of the division in this country. Some people say we have never seen anything like it. You've made a point during the campaign of talking about how you don't really like how the Republicans do become in many ways. So how would you bring the country together, including Republicans?"", ""CLINTON: Well, the same way I always have. When I'm not actually running for office, I work closely with everybody, including Republicans, to find common ground. That's what I did when I helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program that insures 8 million kids. I worked with Democrats and Republicans. It's what I did when I got to the Senate and, you know, worked with Republicans to get health care for our National Guard and Reserve members when they weren't being deployed. I worked on responding to 9/11. I found common ground on a number of issues with respect to health care and the like. As secretary of state, the same thing. So, Alisyn, I think that you've got to work at it every single day. There is no shortcut. You have to build the relationships and you have to be willing to try to meet people where they are and move them over. That's the way politics works in America. That's the way our system is set up to work. Now we can get frustrated by it. We can wish that it were smoother. But I'm very proud of the record that President Obama has compiled. You know, the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank regulations on Wall Street, getting our economy out of the ditch. The Republicans put it into working to put those sanctions on Iran, the effort I led. And so much more. So I know how you get things done. I am a progressive who wants to make progress and actually produce real results in people's lives. That's what I'm offering. I'm not overpromising. I'm laying out the plans that I have. I'm asking people to look at them and I'm asking people to hold me accountable. Because I want to get back to working together to try to unite this country to make it possible for us to set big goals and achieve them. That's what I intend to do."", ""CAMEROTA: Let's talk about how this differs for you than 2008. Once again, you find yourself here in Iowa with an opponent who some think sort of came out of nowhere but who has garnered a lot of excitement. So why isn't this deja vu all over again for you today?"", ""CLINTON: Well, look, I always thought we'd have a close contest and I think that is good. It's good for the Democratic Party. But I'm thrilled at my campaign and we learned a lot of lessons. We have applied those lessons. We have got a great team working literally around the clock. I think I'm a better candidate. I think my experience as secretary of state gave me a depth and understanding about what the next president will face that, frankly, nobody else running on either side could have. And I think that what voters are looking for is a way out of their frustration. Yeah, people are angry. People are disappointed. People are worried. You know, what happened in the Great Recession was a body blow. I mean, 9 million people lost their jobs and 5 million houses were lost and $13 trillion and family wealth was wiped out. People haven't gotten a raise. They have been working but they don't feel like they are getting ahead. So they deserve — the American people deserve to be worried. But what I'm offering is a way forward. You know, once you get through the anger and the political attacks and all the rest of it, people have to ask themselves, who can do the most for me and my family? Who can protect our country? Who can get the economy going and incomes rising and make sure the Affordable Care Act works and get prescription drug costs down? I know how to do this and I'm ready. I'm experienced and I think I have got the best shot at becoming both the nominee and the next president."", 'CAMEROTA: Secretary Clinton, we will be watching, of course, with great interest what unfolds over the next 12 hours.

Tell us about that sigh of relief and what it meant to you.', ""CLINTON: Right. Oh, Chris, it meant the world to me. As we all remember, I was not successful in Iowa last time and I know how hard that caucus process is. So proud of our organization, our volunteers, all my supporters. Everybody said if there were a big turnout, that would advantage Senator Sanders. There was a big turnout, and we won. And now I'm in New Hampshire looking forward to the primary next Tuesday and continuing to make my case in this contest of ideas between me and the senator."", 'MATTHEWS: Well, you know, ""The New York Times"" ran this story this morning that you were disappointed, and I think it\'s possible to be both disappointed and relieved. You could have been disappointed at 9:00 but very relieved at 11:00. I mean, the times change during the course as the results come in. Are both those possible? You thought you could have done better with your field operation but you\'re also glad you came out ahead?', ""CLINTON: Look, Chris, I really believe that during the last few weeks leading up to the caucus, I could feel the energy building. It's a tough process and what I was seeing on the ground as people were telling me they were changing their minds, that they were supporting me, what my organizers were reporting, was all consistent that it was going to be close, but if we did our work, and we did, we would win. So I was thrilled by winning and getting that boost out of Iowa here in New Hampshire where I am in Senator Sanders' backyard, as you know, as a political expert of your many years, that New Hampshire votes for neighbors. And so I have to really get out there, make my case, which I intend to do this week."", ""MATTHEWS: I just love the way you snuck that in. It's his backyard, therefore he has an advantage geographically and we shouldn't put too much stock into it. But let me ask you about this, because I'm looking at these polls. There's a range in the polling over the last couple weeks in New Hampshire and it is his back yard. Look at the map, it's Vermont and New Hampshire right next to each other, twin there. Between 6 and 33 points he's got a lead on you up there, and I wonder how much ground you can make in a week, because we only have a week now."", ""CLINTON: I feel really good about my campaign in New Hampshire and I remember getting off the plane in New Hampshire after the Iowa caucuses last time where I did not win, and I was way behind going into what was then just five days before the primary. And the work that was done on my behalf, the people who came out to support me, the incredible excitement — I saw that today in Nashua. I got here, it was amazing, Chris. The level of enthusiasm, people who were with me before, people who were with President Obama in '08, everybody working so hard to support me, to get to that primary, to do everything we possibly can. We're not leaving anything on the ground. We're moving forward. And I think we'll do well."", 'MATTHEWS: I think everybody should have been impressed. Maybe I wasn\'t as impressed as I should have been, but everybody should have been, about the way you handled New Hampshire last time around. You came off the loss in Iowa. You went out there and you would stand there — it was like Bill Clinton staying there until the last dog died. You were out there on that arena, I remember you standing in a, I think it was a field house, and you went on and on and on. It went on for five hours. It was incredible. It was a marathon, answering every single question of everyone in that room. It really was a physical — a marathon.

I'm really happy we've got a forum on CNN tomorrow night. We've got your MSNBC debate on Thursday night, which will give us a chance to reach a larger audience. But I'm going to be there day after day between now and Tuesday. I respect this primary process. I know how seriously people take it. And I just want them to understand what I'm offering, what I believe we can do. You know, ideas that sound good on paper but can't create results for people are just that, good ideas on paper. I have a track record of producing results. I know how to do all parts of this job. Because we're going to be voting for both a president and a commander in chief.

And I feel good about the opportunity I'll have to get out, meet with granite staters, make my case, and I'm going to do everything possible to get them to support me next Tuesday."", ""MATTHEWS: I know you've been saying nice things about your only opponent now. It's really a battle since Martin O'Malley, Governor O'Malley has withdrawn. It's a two-person race. The only person, and I'm going to say this bluntly — the only person between a confirmed socialist who's calling for political revolution in this country, winning the nomination of the Democratic party, which has always been more moderate than that, is you. So when you saw that rally last night, the young people all around Senator Sanders, when he yelled revolution out there and they all applauded like mad, do you think that's something that is going to help in a general election, or are we looking at, what we used to call in the 60s, an NDC campaign — November doesn't count. We just want to win the party, we don't care about the general. You seem to be focused on the general. How do you beat a person who's coming along in the primaries, however, who's saying, I'm going to give you all the things you want, free tuition, more social security benefits without an increase in your taxes, healthcare from birth to death, all government paid. How do you compete with a revolution of promises, really?"", ""CLINTON: Well first, let me say, I am thrilled, too, that we've got young people getting active in the campaign on the Democratic side. I was very proud of the many, many young people working for me, volunteering for me, voting, caucusing for me in Iowa, and the ones I have here in New Hampshire, I'm just so impressed with. So that's a net good no matter what. I do think that we have an obligation to keep people focused on what's at stake in this election, and you got close to saying it, Chris. We can't let the Republicans rip away the progress we've made. We can't let them go back to trickle-down economics, repeal the affordable care act, we can't let them stack the supreme court for another generation against common sense kind of changes that we need. We've got to get back to the middle, we've got to get back to the big center, we've got to get back to solving problems. That's how we make progress in America. I am proud to be in a line of Democratic presidents who just got in there and fought it out, who got civil rights, who got an economy producing high incomes, who got, finally, the affordable care act, something we've been fighting for since Harry Truman. I know how hard this is and I totally appreciate how exciting it can be to be involved in a campaign that really just puts out these great big ideas. But I want folks to stop and think, no matter what age you are, OK, we agree on getting the economy going. We agree on raising incomes, we agree on combating climate change, we agree on universal coverage. Who has the track record? Who's gotten the results? Who can actually produce the kind of change you want for yourself and your family and for our country? So I'm very energized about this because I like a contest of ideas. That's what politics should be about. We're going to be talking about and arguing about issues on our side, they're going to keep insulting each other on the Republican side, but the goal for any sensible American has to be, do not turn the white house over to the Republicans in November. Do not turn the supreme court further over to their nominees. We can't let that happen."", ""MATTHEWS: Well, of course, I think you're offering a lesson in civics and I wonder if we can do that in a couple weeks now. Look, the history of the Democratic party, your party, not Bernie Sanders, he's not a Democratic party member — your party has produced The New Deal. It produced, the progressive income tax came from the Democrats, from Wilson. Social security, the greatest anti-poverty program ever, came from Roosevelt. And Harry Truman started to fight for health care and civil rights and all these good things that led to the affordable care act. But in every case, you had to battle Republicans who voted against it to the last person. And it's always been a tough fight. You need 60 votes in the senate, you need, what is it, 218 in the house, and if you don't have it, nothing gets done. The Bernie people need to be taught, not him, he won't be taught — the kids behind him need to be told, this is how it works in our system. You can call for revolution, but it ain't going to happen. There isn't going to be a revolution. There's going to be an election, an inauguration, and then there's going to be a congress sitting with you you've got to do business with, no matter who gets elected. You don't have to worry about logic anymore, just, I'm going to have a revolution and pay for everything."", ""CLINTON: Well, where I come out on this is, I don't think our country or the American people can wait. I don't think they can wait for better jobs with rising incomes, getting prescription drug costs down. I think people want to vote for somebody who is going to get in there on the first day, knows how to do the job, is prepared to do the job, and gets to work. And I will give everything I've got to make sure that we preserve the progress we've made, because you're right, it is hard fought. Our system is set up to make it difficult. Checks and balances, separation of powers — our founders knew that if we were going to survive as a great democracy that they were creating, we had to have a system that kept the passions at bay. We had to have people who were willing to roll up their sleeves and compromise. We couldn't have idealogues who were just hurling their rhetoric back and forth. We had to actually produce results. That hasn't changed since George Washington. We've got to produce results now because a democracy is a fragile organism, Chris. People have to believe they have a stake in it, that their voices count, that their votes count. But then they've got to see results from their investment in our democracy. Our democracy has to work better, our economy has to work better, our politics has to work better. That's what I know how to do and that's what we have to get done in this election."", ""MATTHEWS: Madame secretary, unofficially, not on behalf of MSNBC or NBC, congratulations on last night and your much deserved relief and break a leg on Thursday night even if you're the only one in the chair. Thank you for joining us today."", ""CLINTON: I'm going to be there."", 'MATTHEWS: You said it, I believe you. Thank you.', ""CLINTON: I'll be there. Bye-bye."", 'MATTHEWS: Thank you.']"
42,            Hillary Clinton          ,"February 02, 2016","[""BLITZER: The breaking news this hour. It's now official. Hillary Clinton has been declared the winner of the Iowa caucuses. She beat Bernie Sanders by a razor-thin margin just 0.2 of a percentage point. Her campaign claimed victory overnight but the Iowa Democratic Party has just issued the final results. They say Hillary Clinton is the winner of the Iowa caucuses. And Secretary Clinton is joining us now from Nashua, New Hampshire. Madam Secretary, thanks very much for joining us. What's your reaction to the official results now declaring you the winner of the Iowa caucuses?"", 'CLINTON: I am so thrilled, Wolf. I feel really good and very grateful to the team I had on the ground, to the tens of thousands of Iowans who volunteered, knocked on doors, came out and caucused last night. And I could feel the energy building in the weeks leading up to the caucus. I was out there, making my case about what I want to do and what I think our country must do to get real results with more jobs, rising incomes, build on the Affordable Care Act, deal with climate change, clean energy, defend our rights, all the things I feel passionate about. And I could just watch and, in fact, in that last week I had so many people come up to me and say that they had decided to support me and it could not have been better. It was a great, great night.', 'BLITZER: You said last night you breathed a big sigh of relief, your words — a big sigh of relief. What did you mean by that?', ""CLINTON: Well, as you recall, my luck was not that good last time around. And it was wonderful to win the caucus and to have that experience of all the hard work, the grassroots organizing pay off the way it did. Now we're here in New Hampshire and we are going to have a contest of ideas. I'm looking forward to the forum tomorrow night on CNN and then a debate Thursday night, here in New Hampshire, because I think that Democratic voters and other Americans want to know what are the principal differences between me and my friend and opponent, Senator Sanders. And I want to get that information out there. I think it's important people understand that good ideas are one thing but you got to know how to implement. You've got to have a record of getting results. And I'm taking my ideas and my record to the people of New Hampshire this week."", ""BLITZER: The Sanders campaign says they won't have this debate Thursday night with you unless you agree to a subsequent debate before the New York primary in New York City. Are you willing to agree to that?"", ""CLINTON: Well, you know, Wolf, this is really hard to follow because, when we said we would do the debate, they came back with conditions. We met the conditions. Then they said they want different conditions. And we've tried to be very accommodating but, you know, we have agreed with everything that they have asked us to do. And I sure hope — we're in Bernie Sanders' backyard here in New Hampshire. I sure hope he intends to show up in his neighboring state and let the people of New Hampshire see us both on the debate stage."", 'BLITZER: Well, just to press the point, the debate in New York City that they want, are you accepting that?', ""CLINTON: No. We've accepted all of their conditions. We did that last week. And they keep trying to add new conditions, which, you know, raises questions about how ready or willing they are to debate here in New Hampshire. We met their conditions. We agreed to more debates, something that I wanted to do because I think it's great to debate and we're ready. I'm going to be there Thursday night."", ""BLITZER: All right. Let's move on. The senator's campaign — they want to do not necessarily a recount but they want to check the voting in Iowa. Is that OK with you?"", ""CLINTON: You know, look, I — they — I can say that I believe the Democratic Party of Iowa ran a good caucus from everything that our people told me. There was an enormous turnout, which everybody said would tremendously favor Senator Sanders. If there are legitimate issues, both sides, I don't think the Democratic Party has any problems with that. But from everything we have learned and know, I won and I'm very proud of that."", 'BLITZER: Back in 2008, as you well remember, you lost Iowa but then you came back to win New Hampshire. This time you won Iowa. Can you win New Hampshire one week from today?', ""CLINTON: Well, I think it's certainly what I'm aiming for. I care a lot about this state. I view it as being the first-in-the-nation primary for a reason. I know that they tend to favor their neighbors. That's the pattern, the history of the primary. And Senator Sanders is a neighbor. But I think we will have a good contest, talking about what results we can produce, what our records have been, both in domestic policy, foreign policy, national security and I think the people of New Hampshire will get a chance to really evaluate both of us. And I feel good about my prospects."", ""BLITZER: You described yourself in your speech last night as a progressive that gets things done. Are you suggesting Bernie Sanders — he may be a progressive but he can't get things done?"", ""CLINTON: I'm talking about my record. I'm talking about the Children's Health Insurance Program for 8 million kids. I'm talking about getting health care for National Guard members. I'm talking about helping to push through a treaty to lower nuclear weapons between us and the Russians when I was secretary of state. I'm talking about building the coalition against Iran to bring them to the negotiating table and so many other issues. I have a very long record of getting results for people. That's what I care about. You know, I am all for laying out our ideology, talking about our ideas. I think that's great and it gives you the direction that you want to head. But at the end of the day, what matters to me is that we move our country forward. We actually get more good jobs with rising incomes. We get equal pay for women. We actually begin to move toward early childhood education and paid family leave. And we are ready to really go into the rest of the 21st century with the kind of confidence and optimism that I think our country should be having. So I'm going to lay out my record, lay out my ideas and Senator Sanders can certainly lay out his own and we'll leave it up to the people of New Hampshire to decide what they think is the best choice for them and their families and the results they want to see for themselves in our country."", 'BLITZER: As you know, according to the entrance polls in Iowa, Bernie Sanders did a lot better than you did with younger voters, younger men and even younger women. Why do you think is he doing so well with younger voters out there?', ""CLINTON: I'm thrilled to see so many young people get into the political process and I was very proud of all the young people who worked for me, volunteered for me, supported me. That's all to the good and it's great for the Democratic Party. But I'm going to have some work to do to reach out to young voters, maybe first-time voters, who have to make a tough decision as they evaluate who should be our president, our commander in chief, and I intend to do that, laying out my case, where we contrast on the issues, what I think can be done to get college to be affordable. I think my plan is going to really help the people who need it most without ballooning costs. I'm going to set forth my plan to refinance student debt, a problem I hear throughout New Hampshire and the country and why I think my plan will help more young people really get started with their lives. The emphasis I want to make on small business, my call that young people join our campaign and then be part of making us the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. And let's defend our rights. I am very proud that I got the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, that I got the endorsement of the Human Rights Campaign, that I got the endorsement of The Brady Campaign and Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly and so many others, because they know me and they know what I have done. They know the kind of leader I am. And I want young people to know that as well."", 'BLITZER: As you know, Marco Rubio did rather well, coming in at an impressive third place in the Iowa Republican caucuses just behind Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz won Iowa. What do you think about the possibility, if you do get the Democratic nomination, of running against Senator Rubio in a general election?', ""CLINTON: You know, Wolf, I'm not thinking that far ahead. My timeframe is next Tuesday and the primary in New Hampshire and then I'll go on to the caucuses in Nevada and the primary at the end of the month in South Carolina and then to the states that lie ahead. I'm going let the Republicans, you know, decide who their nominee will be. I will be prepared to run against and win, no matter who they nominate. I think, as everybody is well aware, I am pretty battle tested. It's important to have gone through this, to know what the Republicans will do. They're already running $6 million of ads against me along with their, you know, Wall Street buddies. And so they know who they don't want to be the Democratic nominee. And I take that as perversely flattering because they also know that I mean what I say and I'll do what I have said, to make sure that they don't ever wreck our economy again. So I'm going take them on as I have over the years and then, when I win, I will certainly reach out, work with them and find common ground wherever we can."", 'BLITZER: Madam Secretary, thanks very much for joining us. Congratulations on your win in Iowa.', 'CLINTON: Thank you so much, Wolf. Great to talk to you again.', 'BLITZER: Thank you.']"
43,            Hillary Clinton          ,"February 03, 2016","['COOPER: And welcome back to the CNN Democratic Presidential Town Hall at the Derry Opera House in New Hampshire. Thanks very much for being with us. You heard from Senator Bernie Sanders. Please welcome the former secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. [applause]', 'Please.', 'CLINTON: Hello.', 'COOPER: Welcome.', 'CLINTON: Thank you very much.', ""COOPER: So you've obviously had a pretty incredible several past couple of days. Congratulations on winning in Iowa. New Hampshire has always been good to the Clintons. How does it feel out there?"", ""CLINTON: It feels great. I've had just an amazing time. We landed in the middle of the night from Iowa still pretty pumped up about winning there, and then got to work the next day. And I'm seeing a lot of old friends, meeting a lot of new people. I have an uphill climb and I'm going to climb as high and hard as I can because I want to make my case for the people of New Hampshire. As you said, they're people that I feel very close to. They've been good to my husband, to me, my family. But what's most important is the first in the nation primary. It truly is a great opportunity to get out there, explain what you want to do as president, present your ideas, and get vetted by the people of New Hampshire."", ""COOPER: Bernie Sanders, just a short time ago, said he is the underdog here. Your campaign has said, you know, he comes from neighboring Vermont, you guys are down in the polls. Do you feel you do better when you're fighting from behind?"", ""CLINTON: You know, I don't know. I..."", 'COOPER: Does it bring out something in you?', ""CLINTON: Well, the intensity of the experience and the importance of trying to convey what's at stake in this election, because to me obviously Tuesday is a really big deal with the primary. But the goal has to be to prevent the Republicans from getting back into the White House and undoing all the progress that has been made under President Obama. [applause]"", ""And so I — I'm very proud of the campaign that Senator Sanders and I are running. I mean, we really have focused on issues. We share a lot of the same big progressive goals, but we have different ways of going about them. We bring different experiences. But we are contrasting on issues, compared to the Republicans who, I think, are contrasting on insults. And I think it's a better contest where we can take our ideas to groups like this throughout New Hampshire, get questions, have people vet them, and then let the voters make up their minds."", ""COOPER: You've talked about progressive values. Earlier in the day Senator Sanders was asked if you were progressive. He said some days. Are you really a progressive? In the past you have said you plead guilty to being a moderate."", 'CLINTON: Well, you know, you asked me this question in the first debate, right?', ""COOPER: I did. And it's coming up again today."", ""CLINTON: And I said that I'm a progressive who likes to get things done. And I was somewhat amused today that Senator Sanders has set himself up to be the gatekeeper on who is the progressive because under the definition that was flying around on Twitter and statements by the campaign, Barack Obama would not be a progressive, Joe Biden would not be a progressive, Jeanne Shaheen would not be a progressive, even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not be a progressive. So I'm not going to let that bother me. I know where I stand. I know who stands with me. I know what I've done. But I don't think it helps for the senator to be making those kinds of comparisons because clearly we all share a lot of the same hopes and aspirations for our country that we want to see achieved. And I don't think it's appropriate that, you know, if Planned Parenthood endorses me or the Human Rights Campaign endorses me, you know, they're thrown out of the progressive wing and put into the establishment. That's just not anything we need to do. Let's have a good contest of ideas. Let's contrast where we stand. And that's what I intend to do for the next couple of days."", 'COOPER: It would obviously be historic if you were elected president, first female president.', 'CLINTON: You think so? [laughter] [applause]', ""COOPER: I've studied a little bit of history. But it seems like young women aren't rallying to this potentially historic moment. And I say this in Iowa, among women under 30, Senator Sanders beat you by 70 points. Why do you think that is?"", ""CLINTON: That's amazing. Yes. Look, you know, I was very fortunate to have a great team of young people, men and women, supporting me. But I accept the fact that I have work to do to convey what I stand for, what I've accomplished, what I want to do for young people in our country."", ""COOPER: Why do you think it is? That they're..."", ""CLINTON: But I — well, you know, I don't really know, Anderson. I think — here's what I want young people to know. They don't have to be for me, I'm going to be for them. It doesn't really matter. [applause]"", 'If they are not supporting me, I will be their president, I will do everything I can to give them the opportunities they deserve.', ""As I speak with young people across the country in Iowa, New Hampshire, and elsewhere, I do sense this real feeling of being somehow disadvantaged, put on the wrong side of American opportunity. And I understand that. I mean the student debt problems, the feeling that the jobs that are out there are not producing the kind of income or opportunity that young people believe they should be able to get. But at the same time I'm so impressed by the level, the intensity of commitment of this generation to you know really going after discrimination, going after racism and sexism and the kind of abuses that LGBT community members have, looking for ways to bring more justice in the economy and the environment, fighting climate change. So I'm impressed with them. And I'm going to do everything I can to reach out and to explain why good ideas on paper are important. But you've got to be able to translate them into action to get results for people. I have a lot experience doing that. I think I can deliver positive change for young people in our country. And I hope to have the chance to win their support."", ""COOPER: What's wrong with a revolution?"", ""CLINTON: Well, that's for Sen. Sanders to explain because that certainly is the core of his message to young people. I have a different take on it. I think the progress that we have made, and particularly the Democratic Party has made, has been hard fought for, hard won and must be defended. So I want to defend the Affordable Care Act. It is one of the great accomplishments, not only of this president, but of the Democratic Party going back to Harry Truman. [applause] The Republicans are... [applause] You know, the Republicans are determined to repeal it. And they tried 62 times just to turn it back to the insurance companies. Sen. Sanders and I share the same goal. We want to get to universal health care coverage. Before it was called Obamacare it was called Hillarycare, as you remember."", 'COOPER: I remember.', ""CLINTON: I fought really hard. The insurance companies and the drug companies spent millions against me. I know what it's like to go up against the status quo and special interests. So when President Obama succeeded, I was thrilled. I don't agree with Sen. Sanders that we should start over, that we should throw our country into a contentious national debate about health care again. We're at 90 percent coverage. I'm going to fix what needs to be fixed. We're going to move from 90 to 100, which is a lot easier to get to than starting at zero to get to 100. So we have a difference. And I think that... [applause] ... is the difference."", 'COOPER: I want you to meet some of the folks in our audience.', 'CLINTON: Sure.', ""COOPER: This is Dave Skinell.

And if your answer is no, aren't certain critical issues like marriage equality, campaign finance just so vital to what we believe in as Democrats that you would have to know the answer as to how these justices would rule before you make the nomination?"", ""CLINTON: Well, I'll tell you what, Dave. I do have a litmus test. I have a bunch of litmus tests because I agree with you. The next president could get as many as three appointments. You know one of the many reasons why we can't turn the White House over to the Republicans again is because of the Supreme Court. I'm looking for people who understand the way the real world works, who don't have a kneejerk reaction to support business, to support the idea that you know money is speech, that gutted the Voting Rights Act. I voted for the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act when I was in the Senate. It passed 98 to nothing based on a very extensive set of hearings and research. Supreme Court comes along. They substitute their judgment for the Congress, signed by George W. Bush. That is one of our problems. They have a view that I just fundamentally disagree with about what the way we have to keep the balance of power in our society is. So they have given way too much power to corporations. They have given Citizens United, the biggest gift to the Koch brothers, Karl Rove and all of those folks whose values I don't share, and who are doing everything they can to try to turn the clock back. We have to preserve marriage equality. We have to go further to end discrimination against the LGBT community... [applause] We've got to make sure... [applause] We've got to make sure to preserve Roe v. Wade, not let it be nibbled away or repealed."", ""We've got work to do... [applause] And here's how I think about it, because when I was a senator, I had to vote on Supreme Court justices. I'm looking for people who are rooted in the real world, who know that part of the genius of our system, both economic and government, is this balance of power. If it gets too far out of whack, so that business has too much power, any branch of the government has too much power, the delicate balance that makes up our political system and the broad-based prosperity we should be working for in our economy is the worse off for it. So I have very strong feelings about what I'll be looking for if I am given the honor of appointing somebody to the Supreme Court. [applause]"", 'COOPER: OK.

He's a Democrat who says he is supporting you."", 'JIM KINHAN: Hello, Madam Secretary.', 'CLINTON: Thank you.', ""KINHAN: I'm very pleased to see you. This may come a little bit from right field, this may seem, but it's very personal to me and resonates probably with many other people who are elderly dealing with health issues. The question is coming to me as a person who is walking with colon cancer. And I'm walking with colon cancer with the word terminal very much in my vocabulary, comfortably and spiritually. But I wonder what leadership you could offer within an executive role that might help advance the respectful conversation that is needed around this personal choice that people may make, as we age and deal with health issues or be the caregivers of those people, to help enhance and — their end of life with dignity."", ""CLINTON: Well, first of all, thank you for being here. Thank you so much for being part of this great New Hampshire primary process and thank you for support. And I really appreciate your asking the question.

I — I really — I really...', 'KINHAN: Maybe any candidate.', 'CLINTON: And I thank you for it, because we need to have a conversation in our country. There are states, as you know...', 'KINHAN: Yes.', ""CLINTON: — that are moving to open up the opportunity without criminal liability for people to make this decision, in consultation by their families, even, in some cases, with medical professionals. But the issue is whether the medical professionals want to be involved or just be counselors. So it is a crucial issue that people deserve to understand from their own ethical, religious, faith-based perspective. So here's how I think about it. I want — I want, as president, to try to catalyze that debate because I — I believe you're right, this is going to become an issue more and more..."", 'KINHAN: Exactly.', ""CLINTON: — often. We are, on the good side, having many people live longer, but often, then, with very serious illnesses that they can be sustained on, but at some point, don't want to continue with the challenges that poses. So I don't have any easy or glib answer for you. I think I would want to really immerse myself in the — the — the ethical writings, the health writings, the scientific writings, the religious writings. I know some other countries, the Netherlands and others, have a quite open approach. I'd like to know what their experience has been. Because we — we have to be sure that nobody is coerced, nobody is under duress. And that is a difficult line to draw. So I thank you — I thank you so much for raising this really important absolutely critical question that we're all going to have to do some thinking about."", 'KINHAN: Thank you [inaudible].

Michael?"", 'CLINTON: Hi, Michael.', ""MICHAEL FEEL: Hi, Secretary Clinton. As senator and as secretary of State, you have a history of interventionist foreign policy that is troubling to many Democratic voters, including myself. As a voter who is opposed to the United States being the world's policeman, can you assure me that as president, you would not expand our military involvement abroad?"", ""CLINTON: No, I can't, Michael. I mean I — I'd like to be able to say I could, but here's what I can say. I have learned and have been, you know, really in the crucible of making a lot of hard decisions over the last years. And military force must always be a last resort not a first choice. That is one of the biggest differences between me and the Republicans."", ""I worked very hard as secretary of State to do what I could diplomatically to avoid conflict. That's why I worked to get the coalition together to impose sanctions in Iran, so that we could get them to the negotiating table, in order to test whether we could get an agreement to put a nuclear weapons agreement in place. I did that in large measure motivated by my deep concern that the absence of effective diplomacy might very well have sparked an arms race among some very unstable nations in the region, and maybe even led to conflict. I will do everything I possibly can to avoid sending American troops abroad, getting us involved in military conflicts. But I can't in good conscious stand here and tell you that there would never be any circumstances in the time that I served as President where it very well might be in America's best vital national security interest. So I want to be honest with you. I will do what I can, I will stand against adventurism, ill thought out missions. I will not send American combat troops to Iraq or Syria. That is off the table. That would be a terrible mistake. We will continue to use Special Forces, and we have to because of the kinds of threats we face. You know, the network of terrorist organizations — not just ISIS, but others who are part of this unfortunate network that stretches from North Africa to South Asia — pose serious threats to friends, allies, and partners, as well as to ourselves. And we've got to keep our country safe, and we have to work with the rest of the world to try to defeat ISIS, to end that terrorist threat. So I will be a very careful, deliberate decision maker when facing hard choices, because I know what's at stake. And I know you can understand why there can't be from me anyway a blanket statement. But I want to assure you I will be transparent, I will be open, and I will explain to the American people if any occasion arises where we do have to take military action to protect ourselves or our close friends and partners."", 'COOPER: I want to follow up the — yesterday on Capitol Hill the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Commander of the Marine Corps said that he thinks, and I quote, all eligible and qualified men and women should register for the draft, talking about Selective Service. Do you think women should also have to register for Selective Service, like men?', ""CLINTON: You know the first time I heard that yesterday and here's the reasoning, as best I, I understand from listening to the testimony excerpts. That, if we're going to open combat positions to qualified women so that they can compete to be Army Rangers, they can compete to be Navy Seals, they can compete to be Infantry Officers in the Marines, then we have expanded the definition of the all-volunteer military. I, I have to think about whether I think it's necessary to go as far as our military officers are recommending. You know, from my perspective, the all-volunteer military has worked, and we should not do anything that undermines it because it has provided a solid core of people who are willing to serve our country. The idea of having everybody register concerns me a little bit unless we have a better idea of where that's going to come out. Where I want people to register, I want every young person to register at the age of 18 to be able to vote automatically, and I think if — if we had, you know, if we had a system like that I would, I would be very, very pleased about it. I have a hard time imagining the kind of national emergency that would require the use of the Selective Service system. So I just have to be better informed about why they're making this recommendation."", ""COOPER: I want you to meet Rebecca Hutchinson. She's a former State Representative in New Hampshire. She says she's undecided and she's got a question for you."", 'CLINTON: Hi, Rebecca.', ""REBECCA HUTCHINSON: Thank you. I feel in a way I sort of have a follow-up to the previous question. You clearly have very impressive foreign policy experience, and I've heard you point out to us that President Obama chose you and trusted you to be his Secretary of State. But I get stuck when I think about you voted for the Iraq war, which you now say was a mistake. What have you learned since that vote that could give me confidence that you wouldn't make a mistake of that magnitude again?"", ""CLINTON: Oh, I think that's a very fair question. You know, I did make a mistake and I admitted that I made a mistake. And in large measure that mistake really arose from the Bush administration's approach to what they thought they could accomplish in Iraq. The very explicit appeal that President Bush made before announcing the invasion that getting that vote would be a strong piece of leverage in order to finish the inspections. And he made that comment. And the U.N. Inspector Hans Blix said, give us the time, we will find out. Give us the hammer over their head, namely the vote, and we will be able to find out what they still have in terms of WMD. And the Bush administration didn't give them the time. And that was a breach of faith, in my view. But you know I gave them the vote, in large measure because I thought that would give us the time and we would find out, short of invasion. Turned out not to be. And I really regret that that's the way President Bush proceeded. That would not be something you would have to worry about with me. If I tell you we're going to do diplomacy, we're going to hang tough, we're going to get answers, that's exactly what we will do."", ""COOPER: I want you to meet Sean Burke.

[laughter and applause] So I could laugh up here, but it's not easy. It is a brutal experience. And when it first started happening to me back in the early 1990s when I was working on health care. And you know I was just unrecognizable to myself. What talk radio was saying, what Republican members of Congress and their allies were saying. I was just stunned. I could not understand how they got away with it. And I have had to learn to take criticism seriously, but not personally. And by that I mean this. The very fair question from Rebecca. People ask you questions or criticize you, think about it seriously. There are lessons to be learned, often from people who don't agree with you. But don't take it personally so that it just paralyzes you, literally stops you in your tracks. And so now that I've been through this for so many years, Sean, my understanding of the political tactics that the other side uses is pretty well versed. They play to keep. They play to destroy. They are constantly doing whatever they can to win. And they have a history now going back, you know, 35-36 years of going after people who they believe they can't otherwise stop unless they engage in that negative attack. So right now, for example, a couple of hedge fund billionaires have started a super PAC to run ads against me. Karl Rove has you know solicited money from Wall Street to run ads against me. I view that as perversely flattering because clearly they know I mean what I say and I will do what I say. And I will stand in their way and I will stop them from perpetuating an agenda on America that is bad for our democracy, bad for our economy, bad for our societies. So I know I have to keep defending against them. But I'm the one who has the experience to do that. It's unlike anything you've ever gone through to be the subject of tens of millions of dollars of untrue, terrible attacks. And now the Koch brothers say they're going to spend $750 million to defeat the Democratic nominee. I'm still standing, and I will be standing. So don't worry about that. [applause]"", 'COOPER: Let me just simply follow up. You mentioned attacks on the early 1990s.', 'CLINTON: Right.', ""COOPER: Do you still believe there's a vast right-wing conspiracy?"", ""CLINTON: Don't you? [laughter]"", ""COOPER: I'm asking you."", ""CLINTON: Yes. It's gotten even better funded. You know they brought in some new multibillionaires to pump the money in."", ""And look, these guys play for keeps. They want to control our country. Senator Sanders and I agree on that completely. They want to rig the economy so they continue to get richer and richer, they could care less about income inequality. They salve their consciences by giving big money to philanthropy, and, you know, getting great pictures of them standing in front of whatever charity they donated to. But make no mistake, they want to destroy unions. They want to go after any economic interests that they don't believe they can control. They want to destroy our balance of power. They want to go after our political system and fill it with people who will do their bidding. I said today in Dover, you know, I don't think all of the Republican candidates are so ill-informed about climate change that they say they don't know because they're not scientists. They're just doing the bidding of the Koch brothers. They're told don't you dare say climate change is real because we're in the fossil fuel business. So this is exactly what they are up to. And, yes... [applause] ... it is probably — look, at this point it's probably not correct to say it's a conspiracy because it's out in the open. You know, there is no doubt about what they're doing and who the players are and what they're trying to achieve. And they're shopping among the Republican candidates to figure out who among them will most likely do their bidding. So just know what we're up against because it's real and we're going to beat it. But it's going to take everybody working together. [applause]"", ""COOPER: I want you to meet Alison Pyott. She's an independent torn between you and Senator Sanders."", 'CLINTON: Hi, Alison.', ""ALISON PYOTT: I'm sensing a theme here. First, thank you so much for all you've done for our country and for women."", 'CLINTON: Thank you.', 'PYOTT: My question is the number of factors, some you have just described, have eroded trust in you. What will you do to regain that trust, engender trust in Americans and me?', ""CLINTON: Well, thank you for starting by saying it's related to what I just said. And I acknowledge this as personally painful as it is. When you have been subjected to the level, the velocity of attacks that come every day, even if there is no factual basis to it, it's just normal for people to say, gosh, there has got to be something, why do they keep saying this and then we do that. And, you know, I testify for 11 hours, there's nothing to Benghazi, they don't give it up, they keep coming after it. So I know that I have to really demonstrate as clearly as I can who I am, what I stand for, and what I've always done. I've always been guided by the same values. I have always listened to people. And I've always worked as hard as I could to produce results for people. So when I ran for the Senate the first time and I was out there and, you know, people were barraging, I was running first against Rudy Giuliani and all of that. And I was able to just keep going and tell people, here's who I am, here's what I do, I want to do this with you. And I won. And then since years later when I ran, I got a higher percentage. And then I did have, as you all remember, a really tough campaign against then-Senator Obama. We saw each other very up close and personal. And he wins and turns and asks me to be his secretary of state, because he trusts me, he trusts my judgment, he trusts my experience. So all I can do is to just get up every day and work to do what I believe our country needs, find ways to help people, whether it's on mental health or addiction or autism or student loans, whatever it might be. And I trust the American people. I trust the people of New Hampshire to see my lifetime of work and service and to sort out all of the static and to know that I will work my heart out for you. And that's what I hope you will understand. [applause]"", ""COOPER: I want to welcome Rabbi Jonathan Spira-Savett. He's an independent, says he's undecided about his vote. Rabbi?"", 'CLINTON: Hello, Rabbi.', 'RABBI JONATHAN SPIRA-SAVETT: Hello. Another rabbi, Rabbi Simcha Bunem taught that every person has to have two pockets and in each pocket they have to carry a different note. And the note in one pocket says the universe was created for me. And in the other pocket the note says I am just dust and ashes. And I want you to take a moment and think about what you would tell us about your two pockets.', ""How do you cultivate the ego, the ego that we all know you must have, a person must have to be the leader of the free world, and also the humility to recognize that we know that you can't be expected to be wise about all the things that the president has to be responsible for?"", ""CLINTON: Another absolutely wonderful question. Thank you, Rabbi. I think about this a lot. Um, I feel very fortunate that I am a person of faith, that I was raised in my church and that I have had to deal and struggle with a lot of these issues about ambition and humility, about service and self-gratification, all of the human questions that all of us deal with, but when you put yourself out into the public arena, I think it's incumbent upon you to be as self- conscious as possible. This is hard for me. You know, I never thought I'd be standing on a stage here asking people to vote for me for president. I always wanted to be of service. I met my husband, who was such a natural, knew exactly what he wanted to do. I was happy to support him while I worked in the Children's Defense Fund and legal services and taught law, and, you know, had our daughter. I never thought I would do this. And so I have had to come to grips with how much more difficult it often is for me to talk about myself than to talk about what I want to do for other people, or to tell stories about, you know, the man I met in Rochester who — whose AIDS medicine is no longer affordable. And that — that can grip me and make me feel like there's something I can do about that. So I'm constantly trying to balance how do I assume the mantle of a position as essentially august as president of the United States not lose track of who I am, what I believe in and what I want to do to serve? I have that dialogue at least, you know, once a day in some setting or another. And I don't know that there is any ever absolute answer, like, OK, universe, here I am, watch me roar or oh, my gosh, I can't do it, it's just overwhelming, I have to retreat. It's that balance that I keep to try to find in my life that I want to see back in our country. And it will be something that I continue to talk about with a — you know, with a group of faith advisers who are close to me. I get a scripture lesson every morning from a minister that I have a really close personal relationship with. And, you know, it just gets me grounded. He gets up really early to send it to me. So, you know, there it is in my in box at 5:00 a.m.. I have friends who are rabbis who send me notes, give me readings that are going to be discussed in services. So I really appreciate all that incoming. And the final thing I would say, because again, it's not anything I've ever talked about this much publicly, everybody knows I — I have lived a very public life for the last 25 or so years. And so I've had to be in public dealing with some very difficult issues and personal issues, political, public issues. And I read a, um, a treatment of the prodigal son parable by the Jesuit Henri Nouwen, who I think is a magnificent writer of spiritual and theological concerns. And I — I read that parable and there was a line in it that became just a lifeline for me. And it basically is practice the discipline of gratitude. So regardless of how hard the days are, how difficult the decisions are, be grateful. Be grateful for being a human being, being part of the universe. Be grateful for your limitations. Know that you have to reach out to have more people be with you, to support you, to advise you, listen to your critics, answer the questions. But at the end, be grateful. Practice the discipline of gratitude. And that has helped me enormously.

But I honestly think that the best answer to this is the fact that everybody that I know who looks at what's happening in this campaign sees the same thing. The Wall Street interests, the money interests, the Republican political interests are spending a lot of money to try to defeat me. So I just find it kind of a strange argument. I happen to agree with Sen. Sanders. I'm not just going after Wall Street though. I think that's too narrow a target. I think we need to go after a company like Johnson Controls that is trying to avoid paying taxes after all of us bailed it out by pretending to sell itself in a so-called inversion in Europe. It's a perversion. It should be stopped. I want to go after the hedge funds that have bought up drug companies, you know Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Turing Pharmaceuticals, taking drugs that have been around a long time and upping the price. So I take seriously the obligation that I would have as president once again to try to get the deck un-stacked, to get the odds favoring the average American again... [applause] And but I just have to — I have to respectfully say, I think Sen. Sanders' target is too small, I really do. You know I respect him going after the big banks. I agree with him. No bank is too big to fail. No executive to powerful to jail. But we actually passed the process to be able to take on banks that pose excessive risk in our financial system in Dodd-Frank. So let's know the next president has to implement, but doesn't have to achieve that. Here's what I want to do. I want to go after all the other culprits. It wasn't just the big banks. It was the insurance company AIG. It was the investment bank Lehman Brothers. It was Countrywide Mortgage. It was Wachovia. There were a lot of bad actors. And if all you do is look over here, I'm telling you, they're going to be over there in the shadow banking sector just cooking up all kinds of ways to once again put our economy at risk. So I've got no argument that we need to take on these vested interests. I just have a wider group that I think we need to go after, from pharmaceuticals... [applause] ... insurance companies, shadow banking and other corporations that I think are undermining our ecoomy. And frankly they are undermining our democracy. This Johnson Controls thing really infuriates me. We bailed them out. The Republicans wanted the auto industry to just fail. They didn't care about the millions of jobs. Barack Obama and the Democratic Congress gave them a bailout. It turned out to be a good deal. All of us paid for it. They paid back the Treasury. So we didn't lose any money and we saved millions of jobs. And the auto industry just had a great year. Johnson Controls was one of those begging for the bailout. And now they're not going to pay their taxes? We're going to go right after that. That is absolutely wrong. [applause] And we need to be focused on getting a fix for that. [applause]"", 'COOPER: One of the things... [applause] One of the things that Sen. Sanders points to and a lot of your critics point to is you made three speeches for Goldman Sachs.

What will you do to decriminalize marijuana so people — so I and people like me can get the pain and spasm relief that we need?"", ""CLINTON: I will do a lot, Chris, because we have an opportunity to do much more with respect to research into marijuana, what it can do to help people with the kinds of conditions you've just briefly described. I want to move it from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule II so that we can begin to do more research. The NIH and a lot of universities can begin to try to find out. Because I want you to know what we know from science. But I also want you to be able to use it while we're doing the research. And so many states, as you know, have moved to provide legal protection for the use of medical marijuana. I support that. I think that the states are the laboratories of our democracy. We should be learning about what works, what doesn't work. Different states have actually listed the kind of illnesses and conditions that it can be used for. Are they right? We don't know. That's why we have got to do the research. I also want you to know what dosage is right, what interacts with the other medication you're taking. I want to accelerate this because I have no doubt that there are very real benefits for people. We know in chemotherapy, we know from other conditions in using the right amount of the right kind of marijuana. I just want to make sure it's the right amount and the right kind. That's why I want to get that research up and going as quickly as possible. But you said something else which I think is really important. We can't be here in New Hampshire and not talk about the addiction problem in New Hampshire. Not talk about the fact that there have been more deaths by overdoses than car crashes in this state. Not talk about the lives that are being destroyed, the people that I meet, the grandmothers raising their grandchildren because they've lost their children. I just left a rally in Manchester, and a woman grabbed my hand and she said, I just lost my son to an overdose. So I have been working with elected officials like Senator Shaheen, like Governor Hassan, like Governor Shumlin of Vermont, who supports me, to try to figure out how do we put together a new approach, a new law enforcement approach so that first-time, low-level drug users are not sent to jail but instead we have more treatment and recovery programs? There are 23 million people who need help in our country, both alcohol and drugs. There are 10 percent of the kind of spaces that they need to take care of those people. So we've got to work on law enforcement. We have to work on doctors to understand better when they prescribe opioids, which is often the first step towards heroin. We have to have every police department equipped with naloxone, which is the antidote to reverse overdose, save lives here in New Hampshire. We've got to put more money into this. So all of this to me fits together. You deserve answers about marijuana and we deserve more treatment for people who are addicted to drugs and alcohol for other kinds of challenges. So that's what I would like to do. [applause]"", ""COOPER: I want you to meet — this is Julie Carnigan, she's from Windham. Julie?"", 'CLINTON: Hi.', 'JULIE CARNIGAN: Hi.

I want them to know that I was a legal services lawyers, standing up for equality under the law, defending people\'s rights because I believe passionately that those of us who have the opportunity to serve should serve. And then I hope they will look at what I have accomplished from, you know, starting the Children\'s Health Insurance Program that insures eight million kids, looking at ways to try to be smart in reforming our adoption and foster care system, with very partisan Republicans when I was First Lady. Getting healthcare for our National Guard. Helping to negotiate and implement a treaty to reduce nuclear weapons. A long list. And the reason I say that is I think it\'s very important that, as people move toward the primary on Tuesday, whatever your age, you really think about what someone is proposing and what their record is about getting it done. And as I\'ve said and I mean it absolutely, I have the highest respect for Senator Sanders. But as the ""Concord Monitor"" said today in its writing about this, you know, it\'s, it\'s very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable. So I don\'t want to over promise. We\'ve got too much of that. I want to tell people what I will do. I want to be specific because I do want to — to go back to the question I was asked earlier — recreate the trust that seems to have been splintered in America. We need to set big goals again. I am all for that. I have big, ambitious goals. Affordable college, early childhood education, making sure that we are on the path to paid family leave, all of which will help your daughters. But I also want them to hold me accountable. I want them to say, OK, how\'s that actually going to happen? What do we have to do to make it? We\'ve got to get 60 votes to break a filibuster in the Senate. Nancy Pelosi has said, we\'re not going to revisit healthcare. We\'re going to stick with the Affordable Care Act. That\'s exactly where I am. We\'re going to improve it. Because I am somebody who wants to actually produce a real difference in people\'s lives. I am a progressive who gets results. And I will be a progressive President who gets results. And the final thing I would say is, it is still the case that there are challenges and obstacles to young women\'s ambitions. And I\'m going to try to break the highest and hardest glass ceiling. I hope it splinters completely and, and I hope for your daughters it opens doors that might not be open right now, regardless of whether any of them ever do any politically. But in their lives, their profession, how they\'re treated. I hope it does give them more of a sense of empowerment.

And to begin to politicize this so early in the campaign season, to try to raise the false charges and look like he's going to try to make sure Roe v. Wade is overturned and Planned Parenthood is defunded is just a tried-and-true tactic by those on the right."", ""DICKERSON: His charge here, though, is in terms of late-term abortions, that you talk about medical issues, but there are nonmedical abortions, he would say, and others who share his view would say, and that you're not having any restrictions on those who would choose to have an abortion for nonmedical reasons puts you on the extreme side of this."", ""CLINTON: Well, it's just not true. People should go back read Roe v. Wade. Reasonable kinds of restrictions can be imposed as long as the life and health of the mother are taken into account, and that is what the law is today. And I remember very well having a lot of incredibly difficult conversations listening to women who were told something devastating toward the end of their pregnancy, who were facing horrible kinds of consequences to their health and even potentially to their life. That's why this has to be taken into account by each individual woman, by her physician and her family. But, of course, under Roe v. Wade, there are certain guidelines. And Senator Rubio should know that, or I hope he does now."", 'DICKERSON: In the town hall the other night, you said that the financial interests — quote — ""are not giving me very much money now."" But according to ""The Washington Post"" analysis, donors of hedge funds, banks, insurance companies and other financial service firms have given you at least $21.4 million. That\'s about 10 percent of what you have raised. That seems like a lot of money.', ""CLINTON: Well, that's just not the calculation that we have done. But that's somebody's analysis. I'm not going to argue with it. What's really going on here, John, is disturbing to me. I will be really frank with you. What the Sanders campaign is trying to do is link donations to my political campaign or really donations to anyone's political campaign with undue influence, with changing people's views and votes. I have never, ever done that. And I really do resent the implication, or, as I said the other night, the insinuation. It would be like saying that President Obama, who took probably more money from Wall Street than any Democrat certainly had in 2008 with his successful campaign, was therefore automatically disqualified. Well, in fact, we know that was not true. He signed the toughest financial regulations since the 1930s with the Dodd-Frank bill. This is a very artful smear. And I'm just not going to sit and take it anymore."", 'DICKERSON: Are you saying, though, on these questions that people from the financial services industry have no greater access to you than anybody else?', ""CLINTON: I'm saying that I am available to and open to listening to people from all walks of life. I always have been. I always will be. But talk to the — if people want to donate to me from whatever industry, they know where I stand. They know that I called them out on the mortgage market mess back in — before the great crash happened. And I always like to remind people, it was not me, it was Senator Sanders who voted to deregulate slots and derivatives, which gave Lehman Brothers a lot of extra leverage, which was one of the contributing factors to their collapse, which obviously contributed to what happened in the great recession. So, we can take these step by step and try to unwind them, but it doesn't change the basic facts. People know where I stand. I rolled out the toughest, most effective effort to rein in financial abuse of anybody in this campaign. And it goes much further than Dodd-Frank. It goes much further than restoring Glass-Steagall, a 1930s efforts. It goes into shadow banking. It goes after hedge funds. It goes after carried interest loophole. Now, that is full disclosure. I am on the record. If somebody in one of these firms wants to give me money, I hope they know they're giving money to someone who is going to make sure they never wreck the economy again."", 'DICKERSON: In the debate, you also said — quote — ""Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment.""', 'CLINTON: Right.', ""DICKERSON: But isn't the experience you're — the experience you're running on gained through years of working in Democratic politics, doesn't that put you in the establishment, all that experience?"", ""CLINTON: Well, I don't know. Senator Sanders has lot more time in elective office than I do. And I find that sort of an amusing contrast. He's been elected official for 25 years, far longer than I was. I think I bring a great mix of experience. And I think being a woman is a big part of how I see problems, how I think about solving problems, what I believe is absolutely foundational, starting with children and their lives and their opportunities. On my way to Flint today to go and meet with the mayor, who asked me to come because she wants to keep the national spotlight on what happened to the children in her community. And I commend her for it. So, I think that the experiences I have had starting when I was in an advocate taking on the establishment, going on to be first lady, taking on the drug companies and the pharmacy companies, taking on the financial system, taking on a lot of big lobbies like the gun lobby, I think that I have shown that I have got a lot of experience taking on the establishment. And I'm proud of what I bring to the table to actually be able to solve problems and get results for people."", 'DICKERSON: All right, Secretary Clinton, we will have to leave it there. Thanks so much for joining us this morning.', 'CLINTON: Great to talk to you, John. Thanks.']"

Hillary Clinton is actually going to leave the campaign trail here in New Hampshire to visit Flint, Michigan, today. But, first, she's right here... [laughter] ... right next to me, live. Secretary Clinton, thanks so much for being here."", ""CLINTON: Well, Jake, congratulations on doing the debate in Flint. It's really important we keep the spotlight on this problem. And you're right. I'm leaving here. I'm going to Flint. The mayor asked me to come. They're trying to, you know, really have a lot of support, because we hope that there will be some good news coming out of Congress in the next few days. And it's just — it's an issue that I don't want people to forget about. Because it's not the only Flint in our country."", 'TAPPER: Right.', ""CLINTON: There are other places where these kinds of toxins, lead, other sorts of pollutants are really affecting people's lives. And I'm just not going to give up on this."", 'TAPPER: Can I ask you a question? Just a clarification of what you think needs to be done in term of the people there...', 'CLINTON: Yes.', 'TAPPER: ... who need water and need infrastructure built.', 'CLINTON: Right.', ""TAPPER: You have called for the citizens of Michigan, the State of Michigan to be billed, but you're also supporting this bill from senators Stabenow and Peters from Michigan that would make it a federal payment."", 'CLINTON: Right.', 'TAPPER: Do you think that it should be a state issue in terms of the money paying for Flint, or should it be a federal issue?', ""CLINTON: It should be both and partly because there's a broad set of needs that have to be addressed. Yes, the infrastructure must be repaired and modernized. Yes, we do have to get emergency means in to get water, get the kind of nutritional support. You know, I know something about lead poisoning because of work I've done in the past and —"", ""TAPPER: With the Children's Defense Fund?"", ""CLINTON: Well, and as a senator from New York. We had a lot of, you know, old housing with lead paint in it. A lot of kids suffered from lead poisoning. And part of the challenge is you've got to intervene early. We need comprehensive health screenings. Then we need to figure out how do we get the right nutrition and vitamins. You've got to begin to work to counteract the lead. Then we've got to get the educational, additional help that kids need. This is a big deal, because it's not only about fixing the infrastructure, but it's also about the future. How we're going to take care of these kids going forward. So there's a lot of work to be done. And I think it has to be both the state and a federal responsibility."", ""TAPPER: You know, what's really so upsetting is as you know, just a little bit of lead can cause permanent damage."", 'CLINTON: There is no — there is no acceptable level of lead for kids.', 'TAPPER: Yes. Exactly.', 'CLINTON: None.', ""TAPPER: So according to what we know now, the state knew, at least in February — and the federal EPA knew at least in April, and yet it wasn't until months, months later. So obviously, this is a failing on the local level. But do you also think it's a failing by the EPA?"", ""CLINTON: Well, I think it has to be absolutely investigated to figure out what happened. Why wasn't this sounding alarms everywhere? And I don't want to prejudge it. I don't know what the answer to that question is. I'm focused on OK, what do we do now? The damage has been done. How do we mitigate that damage? How do we help alleviate both intellectual and the physical, lasting consequences that children face when they've been poisoned by lead? So I'm trying to look at the future. I know there will be a lot of people focusing on what happened and that's really important, because we do have to, you know, open this inquiry more broadly. You know, I've said that we've got places in our country where we have asthma rates at 500 times higher, killing, you know, young children of color than anybody else because of where they live and what they're exposed to. You know, our children's health should be the highest priority for our country, and so anything I can do, and I'll keep doing it to really beat the drums on this but to ask people hey, let's look everywhere. You know, Flint — we've got to help flint. It's a terrible, horrible set of circumstances."", 'TAPPER: Mm-hmm.', ""CLINTON: But we also have to be looking at other places to try to make sure that this doesn't happen to other kids."", ""TAPPER: So I can't help but notice it's also the New Hampshire primaries coming up in two day."", 'CLINTON: Oh, it is? [laughter]', 'TAPPER: So just to move to politics for one second. Your family has a long history here. You obviously won here in 2008. Your husband staged his comeback here in 1992. Can you win here? Is it possible that you can win here?', ""CLINTON: I don't know. I don't know. I'm just going to work as hard as I can. I love the New Hampshire primary. I love it because the interactions you have with voters in every setting is so rewarding, and voters in this state take a first, second, third, fourth look at you. They're constantly evaluating. I have been telling voters across the state, this is the biggest job interview in the world. You've got to really think hard about what the job is, who can be president, who can be commander in chief, and then you have to really judge us. And I don't know what's going to happen. I know I'm behind. I am in very good spirits about that because I love the process."", 'TAPPER: So you said the other night at the — I forget if it was the debate or the town hall, they all run together in my mind, but you said one of them that nobody can point to an example where you took money from a group...', 'CLINTON: Right.', 'TAPPER: ... and changed your vote. The Sanders campaign afterwards sent out an excerpt from a book from Elizabeth Warren in which she suggests that you took $140,000.00 from the banking interests, and as a result, according to Warren, not me, changed your vote on the bankruptcy bill.', 'CLINTON: Right. Right.', ""TAPPER: Now I want — I would love it if you would address the substance of the allegation. And also the fact that Sanders' campaign sent it out, but Sanders himself backed off from making the charge himself."", ""CLINTON: Well. that's their — that's their typical, you know, artistic smear. You know, the campaign sends out something, gets people riled up, and then they say oh no, we're running a positive campaign. Enough. OK, I'm glad you raised this, because I really do want to get this record straight once and for all. I worked with Senator Warren with whom I have the highest regard, in 2000 to stop a very bad bankruptcy bill. And then when I got to the Senate in 2001, early on, there was going to be a vote on another bankruptcy bill. I was deluged — now as a senator, not as a first lady lobbying and working against this bill, I was deluged by women's groups and children's groups because the version of the bill that was going to be voted on did not protect child support, did not protect vulnerable women and their children from what would happen to them if their partner, their spouse went into bankruptcy and was able to discharge those obligations. And, you know, literally, people I had worked with for 30 years came and said nobody else will do this. You've got to help us. We've got to change that provision. I took that on. And I went to the floor. And I buttonholed the Democrats and the Republicans who were leading that bill. I said, you can't do this. You've got to change that provision. And they did. But they also put it to me. They said, if we change this provision, you have to vote for the bill. Now, that's what happens sometimes. I didn't like the bill any more than I had liked it before. It still had very bad provision. But I also pushed hard for a deal to protect women and children. So OK, I held my nose. I voted for it. It never became law. When it came back in 2005, I was against it. I didn't actually get to vote against it because Bill was in the hospital with another heart procedure, but I put out a statement on the floor. You can look at what I said in 2001. You can look at what I said in 2005. And so I'm glad to set this record straight. You know, but this kind of attack by innuendo, insinuation is really getting old. You know, hey can't point to anything. They are grabbing at straws to make this case. But let's ask Senator Sanders' campaign, why did he vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives? One of the key reasons for the Lehman brothers being over leveraged, collapsing and helping to bring down the economy. You know, this is a debate that we should be having about what our public records are and where we stand. I have the toughest, most effective campaign plan to take on the entire financial industry. I don't understand why he doesn't join me. Because it goes a lot further than anything he is proposing. We have to look at the shadow banking industry. Everybody knows where I stand on this. So I think we should end with the smear and the insinuation and talk about our respective plans."", ""TAPPER: A lot of your supporters were very upset this last week when some older male pundits suggested that you are a shouter. Now, I would observe — I would observe that Bernie Sanders doesn't exactly talk in a whisper. But that said, do you think that — do you think that the coverage of you is sexist? Do you think that when male pundits say things like that, they have a different standard for you?"", ""CLINTON: And I don't want to single anybody out, Jake. Look, we are still living with a double standard and I know it. Every woman I know knows it. Whether you're in the media as a woman, or you're in the professions or business or politics. And I don't know anything other to do than to just keep forging through it and just taking the slings and arrows that come with being a woman in the arena. You know, sometimes I talk soft. Sometimes I get passionate and I get a little bit excited. I don't know any man who doesn't do the same thing. And I find it sort of interesting that all of a sudden this is a big discussion about me, once again. I'm so used to this. I'm going to keep making my case. I'm going to keep talking about what I will do as president. I'm going to keep laying out my record. Because I think it's really important that this election be actually about who can do the job that needs to be done starting in January of 2017."", 'TAPPER: Last question, madam secretary. How has this experience of running for president changed you, if it has?', ""CLINTON: You know, I think the most amazing learning experience. And having gone through this now twice, I think I am a different person than I was back in '08. I think that the experience I had as secretary of state has given me a perspective and an understanding of a lot of the issues that is deep and gives me the confidence to know that I can do every part of the job. But you run at different points in a country's, you know, thinking. And right now we're at a time when people are on both sides, Republicans, Democrats, right, left, people are really worried that our economy isn't working for them, that our government isn't working for them. And that's causing a lot of the anger and the frustration. I totally get that. I feel it. You know, things have been going on that are just wrong. These Supreme Court decisions against voting rights, Citizens United — those are dramatically altering the balance of power in our country. The great recession, for which there were a number of causes, but you have to look at the failure of the Bush administration to regulate what was going on in the financial and mortgage markets. People deserve to be upset. But what I'm saying — and maybe it's not the most popular theme these days. You know, get angry, vent, but then realize anger is not a plan and venting is not a strategy, and we have work to do. And I'm confident we can do that work. But we're going to have to roll up our sleeves and say OK, we've got to make sure the economy works for everybody, not just those at the top. Here's my plan for jobs and raising incomes. We've got to make sure the Affordable Care Act gets the cost down, but gets coverage to 100 percent. Here's what I can do about that. Let's have a discussion about what you would be thinking if you were conducting a job interview. OK, I've got the experience, I've got the passion. And here's what I'm going to do with it. And that's what I think the country needs, because people are just whipping them up. I mean, on the Republican side, all of this rhetoric, this demagoguery, which plays to the fears and the insecurities that people feel. And I just think that's not who we are. We are the premier problem-solvers of human history. We've got to get back to doing that together."", ""TAPPER: All right, Madam Secretary. We'll see you on the campaign trail. Good luck on Tuesday."", ""CLINTON: I'll be there. Thank you."", 'TAPPER: Thanks so much for stopping by. Appreciate it.', 'CLINTON: Nice to talk to you.']"

And it was. The current — that bill was making it a very low priority. So I did go to work on behalf of all these women's groups and children's groups because they needed a champion.

They were afraid that child support was going to be below credit card debt, that they were going to be really left out and left behind and badly damaged.

Obviously, one is that the senator has been in public life next door for 25 years. So there's a familiarity with him. I totally respect that. And I just think that what's great about this primary is New Hampshire voters take a first, second, third, fourth, fifth look. I mean, yesterday, as I was crisscrossing from one side of the state to the other, talking to voters, I literally had people come up, say you changed my mind, you know, who knows. I mean, this is what's so exciting about the primary, Chuck. I came in in 2008, as I recall, like 16 points behind. I remember the night before the primary in '92, Bill's pollster saying, you know, you're in single digits. It's over. Who knows. I love this excitement.

You brought up Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to talk about it. But some of the things that you said about Senator Obama\'s readiness on foreign policy, they are very similar to what you\'ve said about Bernie Sanders. In \'08, you said, ""I have a lifetime of experience that I will bring to the White House. I know Senator McCain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the White House.""

They were very diligent and focused on making sure he was ready, that he had as broad a set of views as possible. And they really went toe-to-toe with all the people supporting me. That's not happening in this campaign. There really isn't any kind of foreign policy network that is supporting and advising Senator Sanders. I'll let him speak for himself. I think that what's important is this job requires you to be ready on all aspects of it on the first day. And we know we got a particularly complex world right now. And the president's not going to have the time. Maybe previous presidents in past years could have a little more leeway because of, you know, the way the world functioned. But now it's North Korea with its missile tests, it's Russian aggression, it's enforcing the Iran agreement.

But I also hope they'll take the rest of the record. You know, I was involved in the biggest counterterrorism decision in the Obama administration to determine whether or not to go after bin Laden. I did put the sanctions on Iran to get them to the negotiating table. I think that this is a debate that the voters really have to pay attention to because it is choosing both a president and a commander in chief."", ""TODD: I'm curious, do you believe if it wasn't for the Iraq War we wouldn't have ISIS today?"", ""CLINTON: Well, I think that's a hard conclusion to draw because, remember, we had Al Qaeda before we had ISIS. Al Qaeda attacked us in New York. Al Qaeda attacked our embassies in Africa —"", '[crosstalk]', ""TODD: The argument is that the instability in Iraq is what has created this and that if we — that if Saddam Hussein were still there, we wouldn't have ISIS."", ""CLINTON: Well, I think that's a lot of jumps in logic that to me doesn't really add up. The Iraq War, there's no doubt, contributed to instability. I'm not going to in any way deny that. But you cannot draw a direct line. What you can do is to say that jihadist terrorism starting with Al Qaeda —"", 'TODD: Right.', ""CLINTON: — and moving onto its latest incarnations, most particularly ISIS, is in response to a number of forces and factors that are roiling up the Middle East. And certainly fighting for what Islam means and how it's going to be presented and what people are going to mean when they talk about it — so, yes, we've got a much bigger set of problems."", ""TODD: All right. Another thing I wanted to follow up on the debate. Senator Sanders called the entire business model of Wall Street a fraud. We didn't get a chance to ask you to respond directly to that critique. I'd like to ask you to respond to it now."", ""CLINTON: Well, I think it's the kind of extreme statement that, once you really take a hard look at it, it's hard to understand. You know, when you talk about Wall Street, are we talking about every bank? Or are we talking about a particular part of New York? That's never really clarified. What I believe is that there are good actors and bad actors in every part of our economy. The job of the president is to weed out and prevent the bad actors from disrupting economic activity, from amassing too much power and influence. But we live in a complex global economy where we've got to have a good banking system that is able to service the American economy. And it needs to be more than just looking at the five banks that are the big banks. We have to have a much more robust community banking system, regional banking system, other forms of credit access. And that's what I am advocating for. And I still do not understand why I'm having this problem getting Senator Sanders to join me in going after what are the potential problems that are out there, the shadow banking sector and the investment and hedge fund sector."", ""TODD: Do you — can you have a Treasury Secretary who isn't familiar with how Wall Street works? And I say this because I think there's so much distrust right now."", 'CLINTON: Yes. There is. There is.', ""TODD: On Wall Street. Six of the last Treasury Secretaries either came from Wall Street or went to Wall Street after. I think there certainly right now isn't an appetite for somebody from Wall Street to be the next Treasury Secretary. And yet can you have a Treasury Secretary if they don't understand Wall Street?"", 'CLINTON: Well, you have to have a Treasury Secretary who understands the economy, the American economy and the global economy. I think there are a lot more places where one can and should look for such a Treasury Secretary —', '[crosstalk]', 'TODD: Do you think you can pick one without having them have a Wall Street background?', ""CLINTON: You know, I want somebody who can make a good commitment to work with me to get the economy moving, to get more good jobs created, to get incomes rising, to look out over the horizon at some of the economic problems that are out there. We've got to figure out what we're going to do with China. China is finally having to come to grips with the fact that a lot of its growth may not have been as on a firm foundation as we would hope. So we need people in government who have that kind of commitment and understanding. But we've got to put the needs of the American economy first. And that's going to be my commitment."", ""TODD: Before I let you go, I want to ask you about a comment Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said — a comment that I've heard her say before. But it sort of rang differently to a lot of people. She said, there's a special place in hell for women who don't help women. But the implication is that somehow, if you're a Democratic woman and you're not supporting you, what's wrong with you? Do you want the vote to be decided on gender lines like that?"", 'CLINTON: Oh, look, you know, as you remember, Madeleine has been saying this for many, many years.', 'TODD: Starbucks cups, I think, centers on that. I get that.', ""CLINTON: She believes it firmly and., in part, because she knows what a struggle it has been. And she understands the struggle is not over. So I don't want people to be offended by what she is expressing as her very —"", 'TODD: You can understand why some might have been offended by it?', ""CLINTON: Well, good grief, we're getting offended about everything these days. Honest to goodness, I mean, people can't say anything without offending somebody. She has a life experience that I respect. I admire her greatly. And I think what she was trying to do, which she's done in every setting I've ever seen her, in going back 20-plus years, was to remind young women particularly that this struggle, which many of us have been part of is, not over. And don't be in any way lulled by the progress we've made. And I think it was a light-hearted but very pointed remark, which people can take however they choose."", 'TODD: All right.

That says something about how you feel about New Hampshire?"", ""CLINTON: I love New Hampshire. And you know, the mayor asked me to come. This was as early as we could get it done.

If you do not win in New Hampshire, does that imply that there's going to be — or in your mind, does that mean you need to change course at all? Will that mean your campaign going ahead will be different than leading into this?"", ""CLINTON: You know, Rachel, I've always had a different view on this than I think maybe some others have. I always knew Iowa was going to be really, really hard. And we won, narrow, but a win is a win."", 'MADDOW: One quarter of one percent.', ""CLINTON: Yes, I'm always happy about that. I always knew that Senator Sanders been in public life next door for 25 years, he's on the Congress for that long, he had a tremendous amount of familiarity and a sense of really belonging in the area. So, I always knew this was going to be hard. I feel good about the campaign we waged here. I think we have an uphill battle. We're going to battle it until the last votes are counted and we're going to turn around and head off for the next contest."", 'MADDOW: Politico.com just this afternoon just published something that says that there\'s changes in the works. There\'s always these sort of campaign gossip stories. But they are say — they say they\'re citing a half dozen people with direct knowledge of the situation. Their lead is, ""Hillary and Bill Clinton are so dissatisfied with their campaign\'s messaging and digital operations, they\'re considering staffing and strategy changes after what\'s expected to be a loss in Tuesday\'s primary."" Are you planning some sort of shake up like that?', ""CLINTON: Yes, somebody showed that to me. I have no idea what they are talking about or who they are talking to. We're going to take stock. But it's going to be the campaign I've got. I'm confident in the people I have. I'm very committed to them. They're committed to doing the best we can. We're going to take stock. What works, what doesn't work? We're moving into a different phase of the campaign. We're moving into different geographic areas. So, of course, it would be malpractice not to say, OK, what worked? What can we do better? What can we do new and different that we have to pull out?"", ""MADDOW: President Clinton was here with you today as was your daughter. President Clinton did his own event yesterday which made some headlines, when he had some very harsh criticism for Senator Sanders campaign, essentially calling Senator Sanders and his campaign hypocritical, dishonest, calling out sexism from Senator Sanders supporters. Although Senator Sanders have called out his on supporters for sexism and said he will not tolerate it. Is President Clinton going further than you would in those criticisms for the Sanders campaign or do you also share the view that he's been dishonest and hypocritical?"", ""CLINTON: Well, here's my view, and I think Bill was really defending my supporters because we know a lot of them are being harassed online, they're being harassed at our events. They are being really treated badly. Look, I'm all for people who are for my opponent. I think it's great to bring in as many new, young people as possible. I want people treated respectfully. I think that's part of what he was talking about. I have been concerned about tone of his campaign over the last weeks. We were running I thought a good campaign on issues. We're getting to the point we have to draw contrasts. That's natural. You know, I have a health care approach. He has a health care approach. We may have the same goal, but we have a different view about how we get there. That is fair game, as it should be. But there has been a constant undercurrent that I said in the debate last week, was a kind of attack by innuendo, insinuation, kind of artful smears. And I just said enough is enough. You know, if you have something to say to my face, say it. If you can point to any event, any vote, any view that you think has been influenced by any donation I've ever made, call it out, you know? Then, they put up the bankruptcy bill. I answered that yesterday on the morning shows. And so, I want this innuendo to stop. You know, let's just be honest with each other. Look, Senator Sanders has taken money from Wall Street. He took it through the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. That's what we do. That doesn't mean his views are compromised. It doesn't mean my views and it doesn't mean that President Obama's views when he was running for the presidency — he took a lot of money from Wall Street — in any way stopped him from pushing through and signing Dodd Frank and imposing tough rules. So, it's a — you know, he gets his supporters — he sends some messages and his campaign then amplifies those messages. And then a lot of his young people get really worked up and they're going off on tangents. They can attack me, that's fine. I'm in the arena. But to go after journalists who say something nice about me, to go after supporters who post things, to go after elected officials who are for me, because, you know, I have the vast majority of elected officials on the Democratic side because they know us both. And they know I would be the president who can actually get done what I'm saying."", ""MADDOW: As a journalist, and who is an out and proud liberal, I get attacked 50/50 by people who say I'm a dyed in the wool partisan for Bernie and then the other 50 said, it said I'm dyed in the wool partisan for you. And people really have decided one way or the other, about 50/50, that I'm completely in the tank. I do not notice a difference in the tone or the nastiness or the snark or the inappropriateness of those attacks that I get from the people who support you or Senator Sanders. If you did want to change the tone of things from your supporters, could you? I mean, he said he doesn't want sexism and other forms of offensive comments from his supporters, can he do more than he is? Could you do more than you do?"", ""CLINTON: I think we should do what we can. But I'm also focused on what he says. You know, his argument basically is this. Anyone who has taken a donation from anyone connected with Wall Street is compromised. They're vote has been bought. They can't be trusted. That is just not true. If it is true, now it includes him we know because he's taken contributions from Wall Street."", ""MADDOW: He said yesterday that no politician, there's never been a politician in history who says, yes, the money that I took influences me. So, therefore, essentially implying like the defense that there isn't, that you don't claim to be been influenced is by the donations is no defense."", ""CLINTON: But let's put out the proof, Rachel. Don't listen to what people say. I find it deeply offensive. You know, I have worked really hard. I've taken on many more powerful groups than he has. I've taken on the drug companies, the insurance companies. I've got big oil going after me. I've got hedge fund guys spending $6 millions of dollars in ads against me, which I would think would raise an interesting question if they are so worried about Bernie, why are they trying to defeat me? I've taken onto gun lobby, something that, you know, he never has done. So, I've got the scars to prove my bona fides and what I'm willing to take on and how I've stood firm against an onslaught of attacks, you know, turning me into the political pinata sometimes. So, point to the evidence. Otherwise, stop it. Let's talk about I want to get to universal coverage building on the Affordable Care Act. You want to start over with single payer. Let the people decide what's the best way to do this. So, that's what this should be about."", ""MADDOW: On the — staying for a moment on that, that line of attack. You had mentioned in the debate when Chuck asked you about transcripts of speeches that you gave paid speeches, that you would look into it. We've had some further word from your campaign that there may be a release of those transcripts. What's the status of that? Do you expect to release those speeches?"", ""CLINTON: Well, you know what I said the other day — you know, look, I'm getting a little bit weary of the double standard. There's a lot of people on both sides. If we're going to start saying what you did when you're out of public office, when you're in the private sector, what you did, fair game. Release it all. I'm all for that."", 'MADDOW: You mean all presidential candidates?', ""CLINTON: Yes, everybody, release everything. But again, I've been asking to do something for which there's no basis, just the attempt to cast suspicion. So, I said I will look into it. We will look into it.

[laughter]"", ""MADDOW: So, you wouldn't do it unilaterally, but if everybody's going to do it, you would do it?"", ""CLINTON: Well, this is — I'm really not thinking about it until I get through New Hampshire, to be honest. I want to get through tomorrow, and then, you know, it's going to be very boring for people once it is done under whatever circumstances."", 'MADDOW: Did you see the Republican debate on Saturday night?', 'CLINTON: I was at my own event in Portsmouth. So, I — I did not see.', 'MADDOW: Have you been able to resist the temptation to watch the clips of Marco Rubio saying the same thing over and over and over again?', 'CLINTON: I did get to see that because I was on every news channel that I was flipping around.', ""MADDOW: Do you have — I mean, he's seen as at least coming out of Iowa as having a lot of momentum as a potential nominee for the Republican Party. Do you have any reaction or opinion about that performance from him?"", ""CLINTON: I'm going to leave my opinions to myself because I don't want to in any way influence their process, because they have to make their decision and clearly, the longer it lasts and the more difficult it is, the better it will be for us."", ""MADDOW: I went to some Republican candidate events since I've been up here and —"", 'CLINTON: They let you in?', ""MADDOW: They let me in. I wear a baseball hat. Incognito situation. But I specifically wanted to talk to women voters who were there at Republican candidate events. And I found a number of different women to talk to. Some are dyed this wool Republicans, but more often I found are women open to the idea of voting for a Democrat. I talked to a few women who voted for Barack Obama either last time or in 2008. But they are shopping for a Republican candidate this year. And 2-1, the reason they said they are shopping for a Republican candidate and not thinking about voting here in the Democratic side is because they do not believe that you are honest. They have issue with your trustworthiness. I know you see this come up in the polls and people talk about their feelings about the various candidates. I'm sure you disagree with that assessment from them. I understand that. But how do you make the case to people, to women in particular for whom that's the objection. That's why they can't pull the lever for you."", ""CLINTON: You know, obviously, this is not anything I want to hear because I find it so absolutely contrary to who I am and who all these people who support me, who know me, work with me and count on me know who I am. But I thought a lot about it, Rachel, because when you think back, I emerged on the national scene in 1992. I have been under relentless attack ever since. Now, just read behavioral science, read psychology, even when the attacks proved to be unfounded, untrue, it leaves a residue, right? People say, well, why is she being attacked so much? It must be something there. So, I get through the '90s. I run for the Senate. Same thing happen. I worked, I gained the trust of the people of New York. When I run again, I get a larger percentage of the vote. So, people who see me in action, people who count on me, people who know that if I tell you something intend to do, I will do everything in my power to make that happen. Then President-elect Obama turns around after that hard fought campaign with all sorts of accusations flying around, say I trust you, I want you to be my secretary of state. When I'm holding office, I get along well with Republicans. I will always have the, you know, right wingers who are never going to give up on trying to push me down and push me out. They view me as a threat. And I accept that. But when I get to work with people, we get things done. And that's been my pattern. So, when I get that question and I ask people, I say what is it you are really reacting to? Very often they don't know. Then a lot of them will say, well, Benghazi. I said, OK, Benghazi. You know, did you know there were nine separate investigations, eight of them independent, one of them clearly partisan admittedly to try to bring me down politically. And they all reach the same conclusions. There were things we could have and should have done better. I immediately said we would. I testified for 11 hours. I answered every question, but it's still on the TV. I hear people talking about it. I can't stop them from talking about it. I can only tell you what the facts are. I can tell you that in the last, what, 36, 37 years, we've had terrorist problems in Iran, in Lebanon, in Kenya, in Tanzania, in New York and, yes, in Benghazi — none of them were every politicized. We lost 258 marines and embassy personnel in Beirut. The Democrats didn't stand up and go after the secretary of state. We lost people in Kenya and Tanzania, 12 Americans, hundreds of Africans. Madeleine Albright was secretary of state, she forthrightly asked for a report. She made it public. People didn't turn it into a partisan attack. So, I have to only conclude that there is a concerted effort to try to make partisan advantage by really throwing some much at me that even if little splotches of it stick, it will cloud people's judgment of me. So, that's a burden I carry. But when you stop and think, you know, the people who have supported me are not doing it because they just like me. I have the governor of Vermont supporting me. I have Pat Leahy, the senator from Vermont supporting me, the two former governors, Madeleine Kunin and Howard Dean supporting me. They clearly know us both. They clearly prefer to support me. I have the senator here, the governor in New Hampshire. They know me. They trust me. They're not the kind of people who would just sign onto campaign for some frivolous reason. I have all my friends from the Senate, Cory Booker and Tim Kaine and Kirsten Gillibrand and Debbie Stabenow and Amy Klobuchar, they were all up here in the snow because they believe in me, and they trust me. So, I can't stop the barrage of attacks. I want your viewers and anyone else who would be interested in this to ask themselves, why does the right and particularly the Republicans, spend so much time, money and effort through the media, through their advertising because you look at the Republicans are running more ads against me than they run against each other, accusing me of being this and that, all kinds of accusations. Why? I'll tell you why, because they are afraid of me. They know that I will be a president who, yes, I will listen to people, I will seek common ground, but I will stand my ground and I know how to get things done. And that's the last thing these guys want to see again."", ""MADDOW: What did you learn by going there that you didn't need before?"", ""CLINTON: Nothing substitutes for sitting like I did and you were there when you were there with mothers who told me about what had happened to their families. A mother who moved to Flint just serendipitously right up at the time the crisis was beginning, a year ago April, pregnant with twins, started seeing rashes, lost her twins. Just sitting there like I'm sitting with you just hearing that story, you know there is a depth of emotion and horror frankly associated with not being able to trust the water you drink and that you bathe your baby in. And listening to a lot of officials explained in detail how little control they had because their city was under emergency management under the governor, getting into the real detail about what they could and couldn't do and how they literally couldn't get phone calls returned, letters answered, talking to some of the water warriors who have been on this issue and doing everything they could to bring it to public attention, talking to the doctors who are leading up the efforts to test kid and what more they need. It really filled out in great excruciating detail how terribly damaged and abused this community has been and it reminded me that people have a right to be angry. I have no argument with the anger, the insecurity, the fear, the worry that people have when your government fails you, when the economy fails you, when politics fails you, anger is a natural and frankly expected result. But as we were talking yesterday and as this incredible mayor who has just taken this city on her back and is trying to lift it up said, OK, we are so distraught, our hearts are broken. Our stomachs are sick with worry about what happens next, but we need a plan. So I came to try to get them more support, working with all levels of government to try to make sure they had whatever they needed to do as much as possible to empower themselves, and I got a long list of, you know, follow up I will be doing over the next weeks."", 'MADDOW: You said yesterday you were making a personal commitment you would see it through —', 'CLINTON: Yes.', ""MADDOW: — to the end. I will say just my opinion being there, my felling when I was there was that I couldn't believe, the basic things that families needed to cope on a day-to-day basis were not attended to. What I aim at specifically there is no day-to-day delivery of clean water in Flint. So, there's a lot love people, average, poor American city, people don't have transportation or people could be house bound, elderly people, right now, still, to this day, today the day before the New Hampshire primary, the plan is for people to go out to the fire stations and collect their allotted one case of bottled water per day — is there a sense in which the emergency, not just fixing it for the long haul, but the emergency of what people need day-to-day still isn't being attended to and there ought to be some quicker response right now?"", ""CLINTON: Yes. Yes. Look, as I said yesterday, we've got a very big infrastructure problem that has to be fixed. Congress is working on that, my friend Debbie Stabenow is really leading the charge. We have a huge set of problems having to do with the needs that people have that are not being met. You mentioned one of them, clean water. We still don't have all the testing set up to be done."", 'MADDOW: Right.', ""CLINTON: We don't have the planning yet for what has to happen in the schools. We don't know whether we can get not just clean water, but the kind of nutrition that can maybe begin to mitigate to some extent the affects of blood before it gets from the bloodstream into tissues, muscles, et cetera. So, we have a long list and I brought some folks with me who are going to stay involved and help with that planning process and we have a big lack of trust, and one of the things that I have advocated is we need to find a way, not just to empower, but to hire people in the community, to be the outreach workers, to do the water delivery, to be on the front lines in their neighborhoods. So, we're putting together under the mayor's leadership a kind of matrix of tasks and who can do them, what they need to be able to do them. A lot of them don't need training. Some of them might. And so, how do we piece all this together and talking with the city council, county commissioners and others, there's roles for everybody to play, but somebody has to have the overall approach that is followed."", 'MADDOW: And quick.', 'CLINTON: Yes, and very quick.']"

I've spoken at a lot of AIPAC conferences in the past, but this has to be one of the biggest yet and there are so many young people here, thousands of college students from hundreds of campuses around the country. I think we should all give them a hand for being here and beginning their commitment to this important cause."", ""You will keep the U.S.-Israel relationship going strong. You know, as a senator from New York and secretary of state I've had the privilege of working closely with AIPAC members to strengthen and deepen America's ties with Israel. Now, we may not have always agreed on every detail, but we've always shared an unwavering, unshakable commitment to our alliance and to Israel's future as a secure and democratic homeland for the Jewish people."", ""And your support helped us expand security and intelligence, cooperation, develop the Iron Dome missile defense system, build a global coalition to impose the toughest sanctions in the history on Iran and so much more. Since my first visit to Israel 35 years ago, I've returned many times and made many friends. I've worked with and learned from some of Israel's great leaders, although, I don't think Yitzhak Rabin ever forgave me for banishing him to the White House balcony when he wanted to smoke."", ""Now I'm here as a candidate for president and I know that all of you understand what's at stake in this election. Our next president will walk into the Oval Office next January and immediately face a world of both perils we must meet with strength and skill and opportunities we must seize and build on. The next president will sit down at that desk and start making decisions that will affect both the lives and livelihoods of every American and the security of our friends around the world."", 'So we have to get this right. As AIPAC members, you understand that while the turmoil of the Middle East presents enormous challenge and complexity, walking away is not an option.', 'Candidates for president who think the United States can outsource Middle East security to dictators or that America no longer has vital national interests at stake in this region are dangerously wrong. It would be a serious mistake for the United States to abandon our responsibilities or cede the mantle of leadership for global peace and security to anyone else.', ""As we gather here, three evolving threats, Iran's continued aggression, a rising tide of extremism across a wide ark of instability and the growing effort to delegitimize Israel on the world stage are converging to make the U.S.-Israel alliance more indispensable than ever."", 'We have to combat all these trends with even more intense security and diplomatic cooperation. United States and Israel must be closer than ever, stronger than ever and more determined than ever to prevail against our common adversaries and to advance our shared values.', 'This is especially true at a time when Israel faces brutal terrorist stabbings, shootings and vehicle attacks at home. Parents worry about letting their children walk down the street, families live in fear. Just a few weeks ago, a young American veteran and West Point graduate named Taylor Force was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist near the Jaffa Port. These attacks must end immediately and Palestinian leaders need to stop inciting violence, stop celebrating terrorists as martyrs and stop paying rewards to their families.', 'Because we understand the threats Israel faces, we know we can never take for granted the strength of our alliance or the success of our efforts. Today, Americans and Israelis face momentous choices that will shape the future of our relationship and of both our nations. The first choice is this, are we prepared to take the U.S.-Israel alliance to the next level? This relationship has always been stronger and deeper than the headlines might lead you to believe. Our work together to develop the Iron Dome saved many Israeli lives when Hamas rockets began to fly.', ""I saw its effectiveness firsthand in 2012, when I worked with Prime Minister Netanyahu to negotiate a seize fire in Gaza and if I'm fortunate enough to be elected president, the United States will reaffirm we have a strong and enduring national interest in Israel's security. And we will never allow Israel's adversaries to think a wedge can be driven between us."", 'When we have differences, as any friends do, we will work to resolve them quickly and respectfully. We will also be clear that the United States has an enduring interest in and commitment to a more peaceful, more stable, more secure Middle East and we will step up our efforts to achieve that outcome. Indeed, at a time of unprecedented chaos and conflict in the region, America needs an Israel strong enough to deter and defend against its enemies, strong enough to work with us to tackle shared challenges and strong enough to take bold steps in the pursuit of peace.', ""That's why I believe we must take our alliance to the next level. I hope a new 10-year defense memorandum of understanding is concluded as soon as possible to meet Israel's security needs far into the future. That will also send a clear message to Israel's enemies that the United States and Israel stand together united. It's also why, as president, I will make a firm commitment to ensure Israel maintains its qualitative military edge."", ""The United States should provide Israel with the most sophisticated defense technology so it can deter and stop any threat. That includes bolstering Israeli missile defenses with new systems, like the Arrow 3 and David's Sling, and we should work together to develop better tunnel detection technology to prevent arms smuggling, kidnapping and terrorist attacks."", ""One of the first things I'll do in office is invite the Israeli prime minister to visit the White House and I will send a delegation from the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs to Israel forearly consultations.

As I wrote last year to the heads of major American-Jewish organizations, we have to be united in fighting back against BDS. Many of its proponents have demonized Israeli scientists and intellectuals, even students. To all the college students who may have encountered this on campus, I hope you stay strong, keep speaking out, don't let anyone silence you, bully you or try to shut down debate, especially in places of learning like colleges and universities."", 'Anti-Semitism has no place in any civilized society. Not in America, not in Europe, not anywhere.', ""Now, all of this work defending Israel's legitimacy, expanding security and economic ties, taking our alliance to the next level depends on electing a president with a deep, personal commitment to Israel's future as a secure, democratic Jewish state and to America's responsibilities as a global leader. Tonight, you'll hear from candidates with very different visions of American leadership in the region and around the world. You'll get a glimpse of a potential U.S. foreign policy that would insult our allies, not engage them and embolden our adversaries, not defeat them."", 'For the security of Israel and the world, we need America to remain a respected global leader committed to defending and advancing the international order, an America able to block efforts to isolate or attack Israel. The alternative is unthinkable.', ""Yes, we need steady hands, not a president who says he's neutral on Monday, pro-Israel on Tuesday and who knows what on Wednesday, because everything's negotiable. Well, my friends, Israel's security is non-negotiable."", ""I have sat in Israeli hospital rooms holding the hands of men and women whose bodies and lives were torn apart by terrorist bombs. I've listened to doctors describe the shrapnel left in a leg, an arm or even a head. That's why I feel so strongly that America can't ever be neutral when it comes to Israel's security or survival. We can't be neutral when rockets rain down on residential neighborhoods, when civilians are stabbed in the street, when suicide bombers target theinnocent. Some things aren't negotiable and anyone who doesn't understand that has no business being our president."", ""The second choice we face is whether we will have the strength and commitment to confront the adversaries that threaten us, especially Iran. For many years, we've all been rightly focused on the existential danger of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon. After all, this remains an extremist regime that threatens to annihilate Israel."", ""That's why I led the diplomacy to impose crippling sanctions and force Iran to the negotiating table and why I ultimately supported the agreement that has put a lid on its nuclear program. Today, Iran's enriched uranium is all but gone, thousands of centrifuges have stopped spinning, Iran's potential breakout time has increased and new verification measures are in place to help us deter and detect any cheating."", ""I really believe the United States, Israel and the world are safer as a result, but still, as I laid out in a speech at the Brookings Institution last year, it's not good enough to trust and verify. Our approach must be distrust and verify."", ""This deal must come with vigorous enforcement, strong monitoring, clear consequences for any violations and a broader strategy to confront Iran's aggression across the region. We cannot forget that Tehran's fingerprints are on every conflict across the Middle East from Syria to Lebanon to Yemen. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and its proxies are attempting to establish a position on the Golan from which to threaten Israel and they continue to fund Palestinian terrorists."", ""In Lebanon, Hezbollah is amassing an arsenal of increasingly sophisticated rockets and artillery that well may be able to hit every city in Israel. Tonight, you will hear a lot of rhetoric from the other candidates about Iran, but there's a big difference between talking about holding Tehran accountable and actually doing it. Our next president has to be able to hold together our global coalition and impose real consequences for even the smallest violations of this agreement."", ""We must maintain the legal and diplomatic architecture to turn all the sanctions back on if needed. If I'm elected, the leaders of Iran will have no doubt that if we see any indication that they are violating their commitments not to seek, develop or acquire nuclear weapons, the United States will act to stop it and that we will do so with force if necessary."", 'Iranian provocations, like the recent ballistic missile tests also are unacceptable and should be answered firmly and quickly, including with more sanctions.', 'Those missiles were stamped with words declaring, and I quote, ""Israel should be wiped from the pages of history."" We know they could reach Israel or hit the tens of thousands of American troops stationed in the Middle East. This is a serious danger and it demands a serious response.', 'The United States must also continue to enforce existing sanctions and impose additional sanctions as needed on Iran and the Revolutionary Guard for their sponsorship of terrorism, illegal arms transfers, human rights violations and other illicit behaviors, like cyber-attacks. We should continue to demand the safe return of Robert Levinson and all American citizens unjustly held in Iranian prisons.', 'And we must work closely with Israel and other partners to cut off the flow of money and arms from Iran to Hezbollah. If the Arab League can designate all of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, surely it is time for our friends in Europe and the rest of the international community to do so as well and to do that now.', 'At the same time, America should always stand with those voices inside Iran calling for more openness. Now look, we know the supreme leader still calls the shots and that the hardliners are intent on keeping their grip on power, but the Iranian people themselves deserve a better future and they are trying to make their voices heard. They should know that America is not their', 'enemy, they should know we will support their efforts to bring positive change to Iran.', 'Now, of course, Iran is not the only threat we and Israel face. The United States and Israel also have to stand together against the threat from ISIS and other radical jihadists. An ISIS affiliate in the Sinai is reportedly stepping up attempts to make inroads in Gaza and partners with Hamas.', ""On Saturday, a number of Israelis and other foreigners were injured or killed in a bombing in Istanbul that may well be linked to ISIS. Two of the dead are U.S.-Israeli dual nationals. This is a threat that knows no borders. That's why I've laid out a plan to take the fight to ISIS from the air, on the ground with local forces and online where they recruit and inspire. Our goal cannot be to contain ISIS; we must defeat ISIS."", ""And here is a third choice, will we keep working toward a negotiated peace or lose forever the goal of two states for two peoples? Despite many setbacks, I remain convinced that peace with security is possible and that it is the only way to guarantee Israel's long-term survival as a strong Jewish and democratic state."", 'It may be difficult to imagine progress in this current climate when many Israelis doubt that a willing and capable partner for peace even exists, but inaction cannot be an option. Israelis deserve a secure homeland for the Jewish people. Palestinians should be able to govern themselves in their own state in peace and dignity and only a negotiated two-state agreement can provide those outcomes.', 'If we look at the broader, regional context, converging interests between Israel and key Arab states could make it possible to promote progress on the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Israelis and Palestinians could contribute to our greater cooperation between Israel and Arabs. I know how hard all of this is. I remember what it took just to convene Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas for the three sessions of direct face-to-face peace talks in 2010 that I presided over, but Israelis and Palestinians cannot give up on the hope of peace.', 'That will only make it harder later. All of us need to look for opportunities to create the conditions for progress, including by taking positive actions that can rebuild trust. Like the recent constructive meetings between the Israeli and Palestinian finance ministers aiming to help bolster the Palestinian economy or the daily on-the-ground security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.', 'But at the same time, all of us must condemn actions that setback the cause of peace. Terrorism should never be encouraged or celebrated and children should not be taught to hate in schools.', 'That poisons the future. Everyone has to do their part by avoiding damaging actions, including with respect to settlements. Now, America has an important role to play in supporting peace efforts and as president, I would continue the pursuit of direct negotiations. And let me be clear, I would vigorously oppose any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council.', 'There is one more choice that we face together and in some ways, it may be the most important of all, will we as Americans and as Israelis stay true to the shared democratic values that have always been at the heart of our relationship? We are both nations built by immigrants and exiles seeking to live and worship in freedom, nations built on principles of equality, tolerance and pluralism.', ""At our best, both Israel and America are seen as a light unto the nations because of those values. This is the real foundation of our alliance and I think it's why so many Americans feel such a deep emotional connection with Israel. I know that I do and it's why we cannot be neutral about Israel and Israel's future, because in Israel's story, we see our own and the story of all people who struggle for freedom and self-determination."", ""There's so many examples. You know, we look at the pride parade in Tel Aviv, one of the biggest and most prominent in the world and we marvel that such a bastion of liberty exists in a region so plagued by intolerance. We see the vigorous, even raucous debate in Israeli politics and feel right at home."", ""And of course, some of us remember a woman, Golda Meir, leading Israel's government decades ago and wonder what's taking us so long here in America."", ""But we cannot rest on what previous generations have accomplished. Every generation has to renew our values and yes, even fight for them. Today, Americans and Israelis face currents of intolerance and extremism that threaten the moral foundations of our societies. Now, in a democracy, we're going to have differences, but what Americans are hearing on the campaign trail this year is something else entirely, encouraging violence, playing coy with white supremacists, calling for 12 million immigrants to be rounded up and deported, demanding we turn away refugees because of their religion and proposing a ban on all Muslims entering the United States."", ""Now, we've had dark chapters in our history before, we remember the nearly 1,000 Jews aboard the St. Louis who were refused entry in 1939 and sent back to Europe, but America should be better than this and I believe it's our responsibility as citizens to say so. If you see bigotry, oppose it. If you see violence, condemn it. If you see a bully, stand up to him."", ""On Wednesday evening, Jews around the world will celebrate the Festival of Purim and children will learn the story of Esther who refused to stay silent in the face of evil. It wasn't easy, she had a good life and by speaking out, she risked everything, but as Mordecai reminded her, we all have an obligation to do our part when danger gathers and those of us with power or influence have a special responsibility to do what's right."", 'As Elie Wiesel said when accepting the Nobel Peace Prize, ""Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented."" So my friends, let us never be neutral or silent in the face of bigotry. Together, let\'s defend the shared values that already make America and Israel great.', 'Let us do the hard work necessary to keep building our friendship and reach out to the next generation of Americans and Israelis so the bonds between our nations grow even deeper and stronger. We are stronger together and if we face the future side by side, I know for both Israel and America our best days are still ahead.', 'Thank you so much.']"

I wrestled with the Chinese over a climate deal in Copenhagen, brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, negotiated the reduction of nuclear weapons with Russia, twisted arms to bring the world together in global sanctions against Iran, and stood up for the rights of women, religious minorities and LGBT people around the world.', 'And I have, I have sat in the Situation Room and advised the President on some of the toughest choices he faced.', ""So I'm not new to this work.

We lead with purpose, and we prevail."", ""And if America doesn't lead, we leave a vacuum – and that will either cause chaos, or other countries will rush in to fill the void. Then they'll be the ones making the decisions about your lives and jobs and safety – and trust me, the choices they make will not be to our benefit."", 'That is not an outcome we can live with.', 'As I see it, there are some important things our next President must do to secure American leadership and keep us safe and our economy growing in the years ahead. These are all areas in which Donald Trump and I profoundly disagree. And they are all critical to our future.', 'First, we need to be strong at home.', ""That means investing in our infrastructure, education and innovation – the fundamentals of a strong economy. We need to reduce income inequality, because our country can't lead effectively when so many are struggling to provide the basics for their families.

Allies provide staging areas for our military, so we can respond quickly to events on the other side of the world. And they share intelligence that helps us identify and defuse potential threats.', 'Take the threat posed by North Korea – perhaps the most repressive regime on the planet, run by a sadistic dictator who wants to develop long-range missiles that could carry a nuclear weapon to the United States.', 'When I was Secretary of State, we worked closely with our allies Japan and South Korea to respond to this threat, including by creating a missile defense system that stands ready to shoot down a North Korean warhead, should its leaders ever be reckless enough to launch one at us. The technology is ours. Key parts of it are located on Japanese ships. All three countries contributed to it.

We're lucky to have two friendly neighbors on our land borders. Why would he want to make one of them an enemy?"", ""And it's no small thing when he suggests that America should withdraw our military support for Japan, encourage them to get nuclear weapons, and said this about a war between Japan and North Korea – and I quote –\xa0'If they do, they do. Good luck, enjoy yourself, folks.'\xa0I wonder if he even realizes he's talking about nuclear war."", 'Yes, our friends need to contribute their fair share. I made that point long before Donald Trump came onto the scene – and a number of them have increased their defense spending. The real debate here is whether we keep these alliances strong or cut them off. What he says would weaken our country.', 'Third, we need to embrace all the tools of American power, especially diplomacy and development, to be on the frontlines solving problems before they threaten us at home.', ""Diplomacy is often the only way to avoid a conflict that could end up exacting a much greater cost. It takes patience, persistence and an eye on the long game – but it's worth it."", 'Take the nuclear agreement with Iran. When President Obama took office, Iran was racing toward a nuclear bomb. Some called for military action. But that could have ignited a broader war that could have mired our troops in another Middle Eastern conflict.', 'President Obama chose a different path. And I got to work leading the effort to impose crippling global sanctions. We brought Iran to the table. We began talks.

And we accomplished it without firing a single shot, dropping a single bomb or putting a single American soldier in harm's way."", ""Donald Trump says we shouldn't have done the deal. We should have walked away. But that would have meant no more global sanctions, and Iran resuming their nuclear program and the world blaming us. So then what? War? Telling the world, good luck, you deal with Iran?"", ""Of course Trump doesn't have answers to those questions. Donald Trump doesn't know the first thing about Iran or its nuclear program. Ask him. It'll become very clear, very quickly."", ""There's no risk of people losing their lives if you blow up a golf-course deal."", 'But it doesn\'t work like that in world affairs. Just like being interviewed on the same episode of ""60 Minutes"" as Putin was, is not the same thing as actually dealing with Putin.', ""So the stakes in global statecraft are infinitely higher and more complex than in the world of luxury hotels. We all know the tools Donald Trump brings to the table – bragging, mocking, composing nasty tweets – I'm willing to bet he's writing a few right now."", ""But those tools won't do the trick. Rather than solving global crises, he would create new ones."", ""He has no sense of what it takes to deal with multiple countries with competing interests and reaching a solution that everyone can get behind. In fact, he is downright contemptuous of that work. And that means he's much more likely to end up leading us into conflict."", 'Fourth, we need to be firm but wise with our rivals.', ""Countries like Russia and China often work against us. Beijing dumps cheap steel in our markets. That hurts American workers. Moscow has taken aggressive military action in Ukraine, right on NATO's doorstep. Now I've gone toe-to-toe with Russia and China, and many other different leaders around the world. So I know we have to be able to both stand our ground when we must, and find common ground when we can."", ""That's how I could work with Russia to conclude the New START treaty to reduce nuclear stockpiles, and with China to increase pressure on North Korea. It's how our diplomats negotiated the landmark agreement on climate change, which Trump now wants to rip up."", 'The key was never forgetting who we were dealing with – not friends or allies, but countries that share some common interests with us amid many disagreements.', ""Donald doesn't see the complexity. He wants to start a trade war with China. And I understand a lot of Americans have concerns about our trade agreements – I do too. But a trade war is something very different. We went down that road in the 1930s. It made the Great Depression longer and more painful. Combine that with his comments about defaulting on our debt, and it's not hard to see how a Trump presidency could lead to a global economic crisis."", ""And I have to say, I don't understand Donald's bizarre fascination with dictators and strongmen who have no love for America. He praised China for the Tiananmen Square massacre; he said it showed strength. He said,\xa0'You've got to give Kim Jong Un credit'\xa0for taking over North Korea – something he did by murdering everyone he saw as a threat, including his own uncle, which Donald described gleefully, like he was recapping an action movie. And he said if he were grading Vladimir Putin as a leader, he'd give him an 'A.'"", ""Now, I'll leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants."", ""I just wonder how anyone could be so wrong about who America's real friends are. Because it matters. If you don't know exactly who you're dealing with, men like Putin will eat your lunch."", 'Fifth, we need a real plan for confronting terrorists.', ""As we saw six months ago in San Bernardino, the threat is real and urgent. Over the past year, I've laid out my plans for defeating ISIS."", ""We need to take out their strongholds in Iraq and Syria by intensifying the air campaign and stepping up our support for Arab and Kurdish forces on the ground. We need to keep pursuing diplomacy to end Syria's civil war and close Iraq's sectarian divide, because those conflicts are keeping ISIS alive. We need to lash up with our allies, and ensure our intelligence services are working hand-in-hand to dismantle the global network that supplies money, arms, propaganda and fighters to the terrorists. We need to win the battle in cyberspace."", 'And of course we need to strengthen our defenses here at home.', 'That – in a nutshell – is my plan for defeating ISIS.', ""What's Trump's? Well he won't say. He is literally keeping it a secret. The secret, of course, is he has no idea what he'd do to stop ISIS."", ""Just look at the few things he's actually said on the subject."", ""He's actually said – and I quote –'maybe Syria should be a free zone for ISIS.'\xa0Oh, okay – let a terrorist group have control of a major country in the Middle East."", 'Then he said we should send tens of thousands of American ground troops to the Middle East to fight ISIS.', 'He also refused to rule out using nuclear weapons against ISIS, which would mean mass civilian casualties.', ""It's clear he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about. So we can't be certain which of these things he would do. But we can be certain that he's capable of doing any or all of them. Letting ISIS run wild. Launching a nuclear attack. Starting a ground war. These are all distinct possibilities with Donald Trump in charge."", ""And through all his loose talk, there's one constant theme: demonizing Muslims and playing right into the hands of ISIS'. His proposal to ban 1.5 billion Muslims from even coming to our country doesn't just violate the religious freedom our country was founded on. It's also a huge propaganda victory for ISIS. And it alienates the very countries we need to actually help us in this fight."", 'A Trump Presidency would embolden ISIS. We cannot take that risk.', ""This isn't reality television – this is actual reality."", 'And defeating global terrorist networks and protecting the homeland takes more than empty talk and a handful of slogans. It takes a real plan, real experience and real leadership. Donald Trump lacks all three.', 'And one more thing. A President has a sacred responsibility to send our troops into battle only if we absolutely must, and only with a clear and well-thought-out strategy. Our troops give their all. They deserve a commander-in-chief who knows that.', ""I've worked side-by-side with admirals and generals, and visited our troops in theaters of war. I've fought for better health care for our National Guard, better services for our veterans, and more support for our Gold Star families. We cannot put the lives of our young men and women in uniform in Donald Trump's hands."", 'Sixth, we need to stay true to our values.', ""Trump says over and over again,\xa0'The world is laughing at us.'\xa0He's been saying\xa0this for decades, he didn't just start this year."", ""He bought full-page ads in newspapers across the country back in 1987, when Ronald Reagan was President, saying that America lacked a backbone and the world was – you guessed it – laughing at us. He was wrong then, and he's wrong now – and you've got to wonder why somebody who fundamentally has so little confidence in America, and has felt that way for at least 30 years, wants to be our President."", ""The truth is, there's not a country in the world that can rival us. It's not just that we have the greatest military, or that our economy is larger, more durable, more entrepreneurial than any in the world. It's also that Americans work harder, dream bigger – and we never, ever stop trying to make our country and world a better place."", ""So it really matters that Donald Trump says things that go against our deepest-held values. It matters when he says he'll order our military to murder the families of suspected terrorists. During the raid to kill bin Laden, when every second counted, our SEALs took the time to move the women and children in the compound to safety. Donald Trump may not get it, but that's what honor looks like."", 'And it also matters when he makes fun of disabled people, calls women pigs,proposes banning an entire religion from our country, or plays coy with white supremacists. America stands up to countries that treat women like animals, or people of different races, religions or ethnicities as less human.', 'What happens to the moral example we set – for the world and for our own children – if our President engages in bigotry?', 'And by the way, Mr. Trump – every time you insult American Muslims or Mexican immigrants, remember that plenty of Muslims and immigrants serve and fight in our armed forces.', 'Donald Trump, Donald Trump could learn something from them.', 'That brings me to the final point I want to make today – the temperament it takesto be Commander-in-Chief.', ""Every President faces hard choices every day, with imperfect information and conflicting imperatives. That's the job."", 'A revolution threatens to topple a government in a key region, an adversary reaches out for the first time in years – what do you do?', ""Making the right call takes a cool head and respect for the facts. It takes a willingness to listen to other people's points of view with a truly open mind. It also takes humility – knowing you don't know everything – because if you're convinced you're always right, you'll never ask yourself the hard questions."", ""I remember being in the Situation Room with President Obama, debating the potential Bin Laden operation. The President's advisors were divided. The intelligence was compelling but far from definitive. The risks of failure were daunting. The stakes were significant for our battle against al Qaeda and our relationship with Pakistan. Most of all, the lives of those brave SEALs and helicopter pilots hung in the balance."", ""It was a decision only the President could make. And when he did, it was as crisp and courageous a display of leadership as I've ever seen."", ""Now imagine Donald Trump sitting in the Situation Room, making life-or-death decisions on behalf of the United States. Imagine him deciding whether to send your spouses or children into battle. Imagine if he had not just his Twitter account at his disposal when he's angry, but America's entire arsenal."", 'Do we want him making those calls – someone thin-skinned and quick to anger, who lashes out at the smallest criticism? Do we want his finger anywhere near the button?', ""I have a lot of faith that the American people will make the right decision. This is a country with a deep reservoir of common sense and national pride. We're all counting on that."", ""Because making Donald Trump our commander-in-chief would be a historic mistake. It would undo so much of the work that Republicans and Democrats alike have done over many decades to make America stronger and more secure. It would set back our standing in the world more than anything in recent memory. And it would fuel an ugly narrative about who we are – that we're fearful, not confident; that we want to let others determine our future for us, instead of shaping our own destiny."", ""That's not the America I know and love."", ""So yes, we have a lot of work to do to keep our country secure. And we need to do better by American families and American workers – and we will. But don't let anyone tell you that America isn't great. Donald Trump's got America all wrong.

Think of what we've achieved these last eight years. American businesses have created 15 million new jobs since the recession. Twenty million Americans have health coverage – and no one has seen a bigger drop in uninsured rates under the Affordable Care Act than Latino Americans. We got more good news this week. A report came out showing that poverty is going down, and incomes for American families are going up, and Latino families have seen the biggest increase of all."", ""Now, that doesn't mean we rest on our laurels by any stretch.

I believe with all my heart that the American Dream is alive and it's big enough for everyone to share its promise. That doesn't mean that lots of people are still not hurting, because I know they are. And when you hear a presidential candidate spewing bigotry and hate, it's easy to get discouraged. But we're here because we know this election is a choice between not just two people but two very different visions for our America's future."", ""Either we're going to make our economy work for everyone, or just those at the top."", ""Either we're going to fear our differences, or embrace and celebrate our diversity."", ""Either we're going to pit Americans against each other and deepen the divides, or we're going to be stronger together."", ""Today, as you know, we're in the midst of Hispanic Heritage Month. In classrooms across America, children will study Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez, Julián and Joaquín Castro, Justice Sotomayor, Roberto Clemente and Laurie Hernandez, Gloria Estefan and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and countless others – names we know and names we might not know, but every one of whom has enriched this country for generations."", ""Whether you're Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Latin American, Afro-Latino, whether your family just arrived or has been here since before the United States even existed [cheers], you're not strangers. You're not intruders. You're our neighbors, our col-leagues, our friends, our families. You make our nation stronger, smarter, more creative. And I want you to know that I see you and I am with you, and time and again – time and again we have seen that when we invest in the community, when we make it possible for Latinos to get the health care you need, get the education you desire, compete for jobs, start new businesses, pursue your dreams, all of America benefits."", ""As I said this afternoon in North Carolina, we are in the final stretch of this election. And I intend to close my campaign the way I began my career, fighting for kids and families. That's been the cause of my life. It will be the passion of my presidency. So tonight I want to mention two things I'll do in the first 100 days of my administration to help families in every corner of America."", ""First, we do need to create an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. There's something wrong when Latinos are 17 percent of our country's population but hold only 2 percent of its wealth. We've got to work together to connect more Latinos with good jobs that pay good wages, with more opportunities to get the skills they need, to go to college, to launch new ventures, to build wealth that can be passed on to your kids and your grandkids. So we're going to make, in my first 100 days, the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II, jobs in infrastructure, manufacturing, technology, innovative, clean energy."", ""And we're going to cut red tape and taxes and expand access to capital for small busi-nesses, including the Latino-owned small businesses that create so many jobs and so much growth in communities everywhere. And I want to give a particular shout-out to Latina small business owners. Not everyone knows this, but you are among the fastest-growing group of entrepreneurs in America. And we're going to put families first with new solutions that reflect the way people live and work today. Supporting families with paid family leave, earned sick days, and affordable childcare isn't a luxury, it's a necessity. When families are strong, America is strong."", ""And that brings me to another important family issue. In those first 100 days, I will send a proposal for comprehensive immigration reform to the Congress. My proposal will keep families together, and it will include a path to citizenship. Now, I know this isn't the first time you've heard it. In fact, people have been making the same promise for more than a decade. But I believe with all my heart that some things are too important to give up on. I've been called a lot of things; I've never been called a quitter."", ""And in this election – in this election, we have a chance to show that comprehensive immigration reform isn't just the smart thing to do, it's what the American people demand. And you know how we'll show that? Well, I hope to have a Democratic Congress next January. [Cheers.] But no matter what, on my first day in office I will reach out to Republicans and say, this is your chance to help millions of families and show that your party, the party of Lincoln, is better than Donald Trump."", ""And while we're fighting for comprehensive immigration reform, we're going to keep families together. When the deadlocked Supreme Court put DAPA and expanded DACA on hold for 5 million immigrants, it was devastating to millions of families. But the court didn't actually rule on the substance of the case. And as I've said repeatedly, I believe DAPA and expanded DACA are squarely within the President's authority, and will I protect them and keep fighting for them."", ""But in addition to defending DAPA and DACA, there's more we can do. We need a simple, straightforward system where other people with sympathetic cases who are contributing to their communities can make their case and be eligible for deferred action too. Like people who experience and report extreme labor abuses. And we won't stop there. We're going to end family detention, close private detention facilities, and stop the raids and roundups. No child should have to say goodbye to their parents every morning not knowing if their mom or dad will be there when they get home."", ""So here's the bottom line. Comprehensive immigration reform will not only be the right thing to do, but it will add $700 billion to our economy and enable America to be what it's always been – a place where people from around the world can come to reunite with family, start new businesses, pursue their dreams, apply their talents to American growth and innovation."", ""Now, I know this has been a long road and we wouldn't be where we are today without your persistence and the quiet courage of families in every state of our union, and we certainly wouldn't be here without the bravery of the young men and women who have risked their very place in the United States by coming forward and fighting for their own future and the future of millions of others. They helped change the conversation. And when President Obama created DACA, it changed their lives."", ""Right now, 750,000 undocumented young people in America are going to school, working, and planning for their future. They're DREAMers in much more than name. I've met so many. I've listened to their stories. They've done everything we've asked of them and made our country stronger in return."", 'So when Donald Trump promises to rip that all away on Day One, when he promises to round up and deport all of the 16 million people living and working among us, including American citizen children who were born here to parents who are undocumented, these are the faces I see.', ""I picture Astrid Silva – who I met in Las Vegas. Many of you know her story: She came to this country from Mexico at the age of four with nothing but a doll, a cross, and the dress she was wearing. Now she's in her 20s, advocating for the rights of everywhere."", 'I picture a young man I never met, whose high school teacher wrote me a few months ago to share his story. His teacher told me that his former student was funny, enthusiastic, and patriotic. He played the drums in the school marching band and after graduation in 2005, proudly enlisted in the U.S. Army. Before shipping off to Iraq, he stopped by the school so everyone could see him in his new uniform.', ""He was, his teacher wrote, 'as respectful and optimistic as any student who ever entered my classroom.' He was also a DREAMer, brought here as an undocumented child. He loved America, and hoped one day to earn his citizenship. But in April 2007, while on a mission in Baghdad, he was killed by an improvised explosive device. He was just 19. The Army called him a hero and he was posthumously granted the American citizenship he'd always wanted."", 'All these years later – his teacher still treasures his memory. And this teacher wanted me to know – he wanted me to know that despite what Donald Trump may say, immigrants are not rapists and criminals. The truth is, this young man may not have been born here, but he represented the best values of our country.', ""We teach our children that America is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Not just for people who look a certain way or worship a certain way, but for all. Everywhere I go, people tell me how concerned they are by the extreme policies and divisive rhetoric they've heard from my opponent – from the racist lie about Mexican immigrants that launched his presidential campaign to his racist attacks on a federal judge."", ""And every time we think he's hit rock bottom, he sinks even lower. His latest target? A minister in Flint, Michigan who respectfully asked him not to use her pulpit for political attacks. He called her a nervous mess."", ""How insulting, how dead wrong. Reverend Faith Green Timmons is not a nervous mess – she's a rock for her community in trying times, and she deserves better and so does America. And again today, he did it again. He was asked one more time, 'Where was President Obama born?' And he still wouldn't still say 'Hawaii.' He still wouldn't say 'America.' This man wants to be our next president? When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry?"", ""Now, he's tried to reset himself and his campaign many times. This is the best he can do. This is who he is. And so we need to decide who we are. If we just sigh and shake our heads and accept this, then what does that tell our kids about who we are? We need to stand up and repudiate this divisive rhetoric. We need to stop him conclusively in November in an election that sends a message that even he can hear. We need to set the kind of example we want for ourselves and our children and our grandchildren"", ""Parents and teachers are already worried about what they're calling the 'Trump Effect.' Bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims, and immigrants."", ""At a high school basket game in Indiana, white students held up Trump signs and taunted Latino players on the opposing team with chants of 'Build the wall' and 'Speak English.'"", ""Donald Trump is running the most divisive campaigns of our lifetimes. His message is you should be afraid – afraid of people whose race or ethnicity is different, or whose religious faith is different, or who were born in a different country. There's no innuendo or dog whistles anymore. It's all right out there in the open now. So we've got to come back twice as strong and twice as clear."", ""Just this week, a mother in Florida wrote to me about her 11-year-old son, Francisco. He's proud to be American, Colombian, Ecuadorian, and Puerto Rican. As he calls it, a 'potluck' of Hispanic heritage. And Francisco has been following this election very closely, his mother told me. He wears his 'Love Trumps Hate' pin every day and refuses to take it off. When his father warned him that might make him a target for bullies, Francisco looked his father in the eye and he said: 'I was always told to stand up for myself and what I believe in. And I believe Trump is wrong.' And good for you, Francisco."", ""That's what we have to do in this election, and that's what so many of you are doing already: standing up to the bullying and bigotry wherever it comes from."", 'Together, we must send this resounding message, and we need to inspire a level of turnout that will help us win up and down the ticket.', ""We've set an ambitious goal of registering and committing 3 million people to vote in this election that would not have otherwise voted, and we can't do it without you. Nearly half of Latinos in America are under 35, and we need you to show up and make your voices heard in this election."", ""So we're going to keep asking for your help. Keep hitting the campaign trail. Please talk to your friends, your neighbors, your community – everyone you see between now and November 8th. Tell them to go to hillaryclinton.com, or text JOIN, J-O-I-N to 47246 to get involved. This election is too important for anyone to sit on the sidelines, as we heard from Congresswoman Sanchez."", ""So let's stand up for a future where we put families first. Where we build bridges, not walls."", 'And yes, together we can prove love trumps hate. Thank you all very much.""']"
53,            Hillary Clinton          ,"September 15, 2016","['""Thank you. Thank you all. Hello, everyone. It\'s great to be here at UNC Greensboro. I want to thank Martha for that wonderful introduction. It means so much to have her here along with her wonderful daughter, Sara, and her mother, Barbara. And the story she told is really one that motivates me every day because it is kids like Sara that led me to politics in the first place to try to make our country and our world better for them. So to see Sara grown up and thriving is very special, and your whole family\'s support really means the world to me. Thank you, Martha, Sara, Barbara', ""I have to say it's great to be back on the campaign trail. As you may know, I recently had a cough that turned out to be pneumonia. I tried to power through it, but even I had to admit that maybe a few days of rest would do me good. And I'm not great at taking it easy, even under ordinary circumstances. But with just two months to go until Election Day? Sitting at home was pretty much the last place I wanted to be."", ""But it turns out having a few days to myself was actually a gift. I talked with some old friends. I spent time with our very sweet dogs. I did some thinking. The campaign trail doesn't really encourage reflection, and it's important to sit with your thoughts every now and then. And that did help me reconnect with what this whole campaign is about."", ""People like me – we're lucky. When I'm under the weather – now, I just want to have a conversation, and other people can wave their arms and their signs. But I want you to think with me for a minute about how I certainly feel lucky. When I'm under the weather, I can afford to take a few days off. Millions of Americans can't. They either go to work sick, or they lose a paycheck, don't they?"", ""Lots of Americans still don't even have insurance, or they do but it's too expensive for them to actually use. So they toss back some Tylenols, they chug orange juice, and they hope that the cough or the virus goes away on its own."", ""Lots of working parents can't afford childcare, which in many states costs as much as college tuition. So for millions of moms and dads, if they get sick, there's no backup. They're on their own, aren't they?"", ""That's the story for too many people still in America. When illness strikes, or an accident happens, you feel you're on your own. If you lose your job or can't afford college, you're on your own. If your aging parent starts needing more help, and you don't know what to do, you're on your own."", ""Life events like these are catastrophic for some families, but mere bumps in the road for others. I have met so many people living on a razor's edge, one illness away from losing their job, one paycheck away from losing their home. And that goes against everything we stand for as Americans. Because some things should not come down to luck. Some things should be within reach for everyone, no matter what. Like financial security. Like affordable health care. Like the peace of mind that comes with knowing that if something goes wrong, your family will be okay. And above all, the knowledge that no matter what, your president is fighting for you and will always have your back."", ""That right there, that's why I got into this race. I am running for everyone working hard to support their families, everyone who's been knocked down but gets back up. The factory workers on their feet all day, and the nurses looking after patients all night. I'm running for young people like so many of you here, who dream of changing our world for the better, and for all the parents and grandparents supporting those dreams by dedicating every dollar they can spare to your education."", ""I'm running for the LGBT teenager here in North Carolina who sees your governor sign a bill legalizing discrimination and suddenly feels like a second-class citizen. And if anyone wonders what the costs of discrimination are, just ask the people and businesses of North Carolina. Look at what's happening with the NCAA and the ACC. This is where bigotry leads, and we can't afford it – not here, not anywhere else in America."", ""I'm running for women like Janelle Turner. Back in May of last year, Janelle was diagnosed with breast cancer. She went through nearly six months of very tough treatments. Last October, she brought her eight-year-old daughter to one of our rallies in Iowa and they made a huge sign that read, 'Thirteenth chemo yesterday. Three more. Hear me roar!' Wouldn't you want to meet the woman behind that sign? Well, I sure did. So we got talking, and we've stayed in touch. She keeps promising me she'll see me at the inauguration. And I tell her I'll keep working to get there, but she'd better be there too."", ""I'm running for her and all the mothers and fathers trying to get and stay healthy so they can be there for their kids. But perhaps most of all, I'm running for those kids. Standing up for children has been the work of my life. As a lawyer with the Children's Defense Fund, as First Lady in Arkansas, in the White House, as a Senator, I have fought for kids housed in adult jails, kids who have been neglected and abused, kids who couldn't get health insurance because of pre-existing conditions, kids with disabilities so they could go to school. You heard today from someone I've known for a long time, now grown up and a lovely young woman, Anastasia Somoza. I learned from my family and my Methodist faith that we are each called to do all the good we can for all the people we can for however long we can. And to me, that means making sure all our children have the chance to live up to their God-given potentials."", ""So when I meet a little girl in Nevada terrified that her parents are going to be deported, it hits me right in the gut. When I meet a little boy in Flint, Michigan, who can't drink the water at home or in school because it's poisoned with lead, that gets me going. All I want to do is get to work making things better for them."", ""That's why I care so much about national security too. I want to give our kids a safer world. To me, that means a world with strong allies, more friends, fewer enemies, and fewer nuclear weapons. It also means leading the fight against climate change so we can leave our kids a health planet."", ""My opponent in this race disagrees with me on every one of these fronts. Just a few days ago he said that if another country's troops taunted ours – not fired at them, but taunted them, just taunts – he'd responded – he would respond by blowing them out of the water. He would start a war over that. That is just one more reason, my friends, why the stakes in this election are as high as any in our lifetimes."", ""I've been involved in politics in one way or another for many years. It is not an easy business. It can get rough and I've built up some defenses. When it comes to public service, I'm better at the 'service' part than the 'public' part. But this is why I do it, and this is who I'm in it for: to make life better for children and families. And that's what this race has always been about for me."", ""Well, now we're in the final stretch. There are just 54 days till Election Day. Just 54 days till the most consequential vote of our lifetimes. And just a little more than a month until early voting starts here in North Carolina. Let's make these days count, particularly here, because you know what your governor and legislature tried to do – make it harder for young people to vote, harder for people of color, harder for people with disabilities, harder for the elderly. There can't be any more motivation than that to make sure every young person, every person of color, every person with a disability, every older person turns out and votes."", ""So in these final days, let's try to tune out all the chatter and the nonstop analysis that doesn't often have much to do with what the next president has to do to create good jobs, to create opportunity, to make it possible for every young person to afford to go to college or get the skills that you need for the jobs of the future. Let's talk about what really matters."", ""And here's my promise to you. I'm going to close my campaign the way I began my career and the way I will serve as your president should you give me that great honor – focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families."", ""Next week, I'll go to Philadelphia to talk about challenges facing our young people; in Florida, to focus on building an economy that welcomes everyone's contributions, in-cluding people with disabilities; then I'll be back here in North Carolina, to meet with more working families. From now until November 8th, everywhere I go, I'm going to talk about my ideas for our country. My campaign has rolled out detailed plans in 38 different policy areas – yes, somebody actually counted. Everything from reining in Wall Street to creating good-paying jobs to fighting Alzheimer's to supporting people with autism. You see, I have this old-fashioned notion that if you're running for president, you should say what you plan to do, how you're going to get it done, and how you're going to pay for it. You can read it all on my website, hillaryclinton.com. We even put it in a new book called, you guessed it, Stronger Together. Get a copy of it because it tells you everything Tim Kaine and I intend to do."", ""Now, like a lot of women, I have a tendency to over-prepare. I sweat the details, whether we're talking about the exact level of lead in the water in Flint, or how many North Carolina kids are in early enrichment programs, or the precise interest rate on your student loans right down to the decimal. Because you know what? It's not a detail if it's your kid. It's not a detail if it's your family. It's a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president."", ""Now, I confess, I'll never be the showman my opponent is, and that's okay with me. Just look at – look at the show he put on with Dr. Oz today. But I am going to deliver for you and your family, just like I did for Sarah all those years ago with the Children's Health Insurance Program, that gave her the chance to be the extraordinary young woman she is. And I'll tell you something else. People accuse me of all kinds of things. You probably have seen that. But nobody ever accuses me of quitting. And I will never give up, I'll never walk away, no matter how tough the going gets. I'm actually asking Americans to hold me accountable for my ideas and hold my opponent accountable for his."", ""We don't need a president who says the minimum wage is too high. We need a president who knows that Americans deserve a raise to get to a living wage. We don't need a president who wants to take away people's health coverage. We need a president who wants everyone to have quality, affordable health care. And we don't need a president who apparently thinks only married people deserve paid leave and only mothers stay home with kids. We don't need someone who rushes out a half-baked plan just weeks before an election after decades of ignoring or putting down working moms. We need a president who has spent years fighting for these issues, who has a plan to support all families in all their various shapes. Ask yourself which candidate you can count on to be on your side, respect your family, stand up and fight for you and your kids."", ""That is who you should vote for on November 8th because as Michelle Obama said in her fabulous speech at the Democratic convention, when we go to the polls this November, the real choice isn't between Democrat or Republican. It's about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives. It's also about the kind of country we want to be and what we want to leave behind for future generations. People have to decide, are we going to make our economy work for everyone or just those at the top? Are we going to bring people together or pit Americans against each other and rip our country apart? Are we going to work with our allies to keep us safe, or are we going to put a loose cannon in charge who would risk everything generations of Americans have worked so hard to build?"", ""Now, I have a lot of confidence in the American people and in our country. My opponent keeps running us down, saying we're weak, a disaster, an embarrassment. Every time he says things like that, I think about Janelle and her strength in the face of cancer, or Martha and Sarah in the face of their health challenges, and that little boy in Flint, who gets up every day and goes to school even though he can't drink the water. See, my opponent has America all wrong. There's nothing we can't do when we come together as one nation, set big goals, and pursue them."", ""And the American dream – the American dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise. So if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage, that no one who works full-time should have to raise their child in poverty, join us. If you believe that every man, woman, and child in America has the right to affordable health care and women should be free to make our own health decisions, join us. If you believe – if you believe your working mother, wife, sister, or daughter deserves equal pay, then join us. Get involved these last 55 days. Go to hillaryclinton.com or text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246. We need volunteers right here in North Carolina. We can't do this without you."", ""And remember, the presidential race isn't the only one this fall. We've got a lot of im-portant statewide races. Let's come together and send Deborah Ross to represent the people in the Senate. Starting on October 20th, you can register and vote early at the same time at any one-stop early voting site in your county. So the heat is on. Spread the word. Tell your friends, your family, your neighbors. If you share our vision for America's future, come be part of helping us shape it. We do not have a minute to lose."", 'We have so many blessings. Now it\'s our job to deliver on those and to make sure every single person, and particularly every child, no matter who they are, what they look like, or who they love, is part of the American dream now and way into the future. Let that be our message. Let that be our mission. Please come out and help us fight, fight for you, fight for our children, fight for our families. Let\'s make America all that it should be. Thank you and God bless you!""']"

There\'s nowhere I\'d rather be than right here with all of you this morning.', ""Please everyone be seated. This is such a great opportunity to lift up the work that so many of you have done for years -- your organizations, individually -- and I am grateful for it because it has helped to guide me in a lot of the work that I've been privileged to do."", ""I want to thank Gwen Hess for her introduction. I want to acknowledge, it's always great to see a woman serve as president in any setting."", ""I want to congratulate today's honorees. Everyone is so deserving of this recognition. I also want to acknowledge a few others. We have some fierce members of Congress with us today, women whom I admire, who have been my colleagues and friends and with whom I am looking forward to continuing our work: Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, Congresswoman Gwen Moore, Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett."", ""And I want to give a special shout out to Congresswoman Joyce Beatty. When I saw Joyce recently, she said, 'Well, you are coming, aren't you?' And I said, 'I'm working hard to get it set.' And I am so proud that it did work out, and I thank Joyce for that extra push."", ""I also want to acknowledge someone who had such a profound effect on my life, in every way, someone whom I admire and love, Marian Wright Edelman. This audience is filled with longtime friends and people I went to Wellesley College with that became life-long friends to me, and so many of you who have been on the front lines -- everyone associated with The Black Women's Agenda, I'm thrilled to be with you. I'm thrilled to be associated with you. I'm also thrilled to be back on the campaign trail. As the world knows, I was a little under the weather recently. The good news is, my pneumonia finally got some Republicans interested in women's health."", ""Looking back, I know, I should have followed my doctor's orders to rest, but, my instinct was to push through it. That is what women do every single day, and I felt no different. Life has shown us that we do have to work harder at the office while still bearing most of the responsibilities at home -- that we always need to keep going because our families and our communities count on us. And I think it is more than fair to say, that black women have an even tougher road."", ""And you, your daughters, your granddaughters -- I was pleased to meet Gwen's beautiful granddaughter earlier -- leave the house every morning, put on that game face that we all practice, and enter a society that consistently challenges your worth. With the images you see, the lower pay that so many take home, that try to silence your voices and break your spirits; yet, you remain fierce in the face of these challenges. We see that every day in the businesses you start, the art you create, the children you teach and the communities and organizations you lead. While your stories are often missing from the history books -- make no mistake -- you are the change makers, the path breakers, and the ground shakers. And, you are proof that yes, indeed, black girl magic is real."", ""Now, I've been blessed to see this magic's influence on kids and communities up close for decades, starting with my first job after law school working with Marian at the Children's Defense Fund. Marian's belief was that every single child had worth and potential and deserved the opportunity to live up to their god potential with the tools and the support that every child needs. And that if we just improve the odds a bit for those suffering in poverty, they could flourish. So she led our team into some very poor communities. We met kids who had dropped out of school because they couldn't afford textbooks or transportation. Some didn't have decent clothes and stayed home to avoid being humiliated in class. Some had untreated medical and dental problems that made it practically impossible for them to learn. Those stories really hurt my heart."", ""But Marian always believed we could deliver help and hope if we never ever gave up. So she taught us ways to think creatively, as well as strategically-- to take our advocacy and turn it into action and results. She sent me to New Bedford, Massachusetts, to go door to door looking for children who weren't in school. That was back before we had a legal requirement that every child, regardless of disability, deserved to get an education. I met a young girl in New Bedford and sat and talked with her on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted to learn, but couldn't because schools weren't accessible or welcoming. So Marian had us get to work and change that."", ""We gathered evidence and built a coalition. We helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. Marian showed me that to drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. You need both understanding and action. And there is no question, I'm here today because of her example. I also want to recognize pioneers like Barbara Jordan and Shirley Chisholm, who sacrificed and struggled so that I and so many other women running for office could soar. I'm here because of friends and colleagues, like Donna Brazile, Reverend Leah Daugherty and Congresswoman Marcia Fudge — three black women who ran the Democratic National Convention in July. It was a great four days."", ""It goes to show that black women deserve more than a seat at the table. It's past time you had a fair chance to run the meeting. And let's be clear: I would not be the Demo-cratic nominee for President of the United States were it not for black women like all of you who made noise at the polls this year in support of our campaign -- who did surrogate events, went to barber shops and beauty salons and cafes, got on local radio and local TV to make the case. We've come far together."", ""And as I said yesterday in North Carolina, I'm going to close my campaign the way I began my career all those years ago at the Children's Defense Fund, and the way that I will serve as your president should I have the great honor of being elected: I will be focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families. The American people deserve something to vote for, not just against."", 'And together -- together, we are going to make this a freer, fairer and stronger nation.', ""We're going to fight for the parents struggling to balance family and work and push for affordable child care, paid family leave, and yes, finally, equal pay for women."", ""We'll fight for the young girls who want a fair chance in life, which is why we'll make universal pre-k available so that every child -- no matter what they look like or where they live -- can rise up and be prepared to fulfill their academic destiny."", 'We are also going to do a lot to emphasize STEM education, particularly for girls and women, and I thank the agenda for making that a priority!', ""We'll fight for the entrepreneur who said that more businesses die in the parking lots of banks than anywhere else, which is why we're going to increase access to capital, and we are going to help African American women continue to represent the fastest growing segment of women-owned businesses in America right now."", ""We are going to invest in communities that have been left out and left behind. Urban reinvestment and restructuring that is going to give more people decent housing, access to jobs, the transportation to get to those jobs, rural communities that are too often ignored and denied the services they need. I am a fan of Jim Clyburn's '10-20-30' plan. I am going to do everything I can to push that forward."", ""We'll remember the pain of the Mothers of the Movement and fight for a criminal justice system that actually delivers justice and a future where everyone has respect for the law and is respected by the law. And we are going to pass common-sense reforms to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people and keep our communities safe."", ""We'll remember the families neglected in Flint and take action so that no child's life is ever put at risk again when brushing their teeth or drinking a glass of water at din-ner. We'll advocate for everyone concerned about their parents and grandparents as they age, and lift up caregivers and home care workers so older Americans can live in comfort and with dignity."", ""And we're going to protect and enhance Social Security, which is the main source of income for older women. We'll stand-by-side to make sure that all of our rights are respected and protected – civil rights and women's rights, LGBT rights, worker's rights and, of course, voting rights."", ""We are coming together at a pivotal moment for our country. Now I do believe that every election is important. But this one feels different, doesn't it? That's because it is. The next 53 days will shape the next 50 years. The future of our children and grandchildren hangs in the balance."", ""On one hand, we have my opponent, Donald Trump, and in recent weeks, he's tried to restrain himself and clean up his image. But as Maya Angelou once said, 'When some-one shows you who they are, believe them the first time.' And we know who Donald is. For five years, he has led the birther movement to de-legitimize our first black president. His campaign was founded on this outrageous lie. There is no erasing it in history."", ""Just yesterday, Trump again refused to say with his own words that the president was born in the United States. Donald's advisors had the temerity to say, 'He's doing the country a 'service' by pushing these lies.' No, he isn't. He's feeding into the worst im-pulses -- the bigotry and bias -- that lurks in our country."", ""Barack Obama was born in America, plain and simple. And Donald Trump owes him and the American people an apology. So, my friends, there is no 'new' Donald Trump. There never will be. Donald Trump looks at President Obama after eight years as our president. He still doesn't see him as an American."", ""Think of how dangerous that is. Imagine a person in the Oval Office who traffics in conspiracy theories and refuses to let them go – no matter what the facts are. Imagine someone who distorts the truth to fit a very narrow view of the world. Imagine a president who sees someone who doesn't look like him, and doesn't agree with him, and thinks, 'That person must not be a real American.'"", ""Donald Trump is unfit to be President of the United States. We cannot become insensitive to what he says and what he stirs up. We can't just accept this.We've got to stand up to it. If we don't, it won't stop."", ""In addition to the president, Donald Trump looks at a distinguished federal judge, born in Indiana, and he sees a Mexican, not an American. He looks at a Gold Star family and sees them as Muslims, not patriotic Americans. He looks at women and decides how our looks rate on a scale of one to 10. I look at America, I see everyone. I see our great diversity, which is one of our core strengths, not our burden. We know who Donald Trump is. Now it's time for our country to show who we are and reject his divisive vision."", ""That's why this election is so important. As Michelle Obama said at the Democratic Convention, 'When we go to the polls this November, the real choice isn't between a Democrat or Republican.' It's about who will have the power to shape our children's lives for the next four years. It's also about the kind of country we want to be, and what we want to leave behind for future generations."", ""We are at our best when every person gets to share in our nation's promise, contribute to its progress. 'Stronger Together' is not just our campaign slogan. It's the guiding principle for the future we need to build. So Americans, we need to ask themselves: Are we going to make our economy work for everyone or just for those at the top? Are we going to bring people together or pit Americans against each other and rip our country apart? Are we going to work with our allies to keep us safe or are we going to put a loose cannon in charge who would risk everything that generations of Americans have worked so hard to build?"", 'Now in many ways, the profound choice is up to the women in this room. African American women turned out to vote more than any other group of Americans in 2012. This year, once again, you have your hands on the wheel of history and you can write the next chapter of the American story.', ""Keep up the great work with your Four for 4' campaign. Make sure we get as many people registered and then to the polls as we possibly can. People say to me all time, 'I just -- I don't know what to do about Trump and his supporters and the things he says and inciting violence and all of the terrible activities that are happening this election year.'"", ""Well, here's what we can do. Let's reject the cynicism, the bullying, the divisive rhetoric that my opponent uses to make us afraid of each other, afraid of our differences, afraid of our future. I know that all of us in this room are ready to stand up against this ... to rise up for our families, our communities, but most importantly, to show up at the polls this November."", 'With our power and strength, I know -- I believe this, or I would not be standing here before you, I would not have run again for president, I would not deal with all the in-coming brickbats that are hurled my way if I did not in my heart believe with every fiber of my being that together we can build a future where, yes, love trumps hate.', 'Thank you very much.

55,            Hillary Clinton          ,"September 18, 2016","['""Hello. It\'s so great to be back here with all of you tonight. I want to thank my friend, Congressman Jim Clyburn; Don Peebles; Representative Butterfield; members of the Congressional Black Caucus; and congratulate all of the honorees. On a personal note, I want to recognize a dear friend who is retiring after 46 years, Congressman Charles Rangel. He is one of a kind, and we are grateful for your years of service.', ""And what can I say about one of the best Presidents this country has ever had, Barack Obama? All through this campaign, I have made the point over and over again, Presi-dent Obama saved our country from a second Great Depression. He brought Osama bin Laden to justice. And so much more. I, for one, don't think he gets the credit he deserves for doing what he's done on behalf of our country and the world. And it's not just the President he's been, but the man he is. Even when hateful nonsense is thrown their way, Barack, Michelle, their two beautiful daughters, have represented our country with class, grace, and integrity. As Michelle says, 'When others go low, we go high.' I know I speak for not just everyone in this room but so many tens of millions of Americans: Mr. President, not only do we know you are an American, you're a great American! And you make us all proud to be Americans, too."", 'Let me thank the leadership of the CBC Foundation for this great honor, and to thank all of my friends in the Congressional Black Caucus for it as well. I dedicate it to all the trailblazers who came before me who blazed trails that I could follow in their footsteps – Barbara Jordan. Shirley Chisholm. I would not be standing here without them. Generations of women and men who struggled and sacrificed and cleared a path for all of us.', ""This award is also for everyone out there helping to break down the barriers holding Americans back, to leaders like all of you, and to a rising generation of young activists. To all those on the front lines dedicated to the proposition that in America, every single child deserves the chance to fulfill his or her God-given potential. This has been the cause of my life ever since I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund all those years ago. And I'm going to close my campaign the way I began my career and the way that I will serve as your president, focused on opportunities for our children and fairness for our families."", ""We have so much work to do together. I've heard many heartbreaking stories over this campaign. One was from Tianna Gaines-Turner, a working mother to three children from Northeast Philadelphia. She testified at the DNC platform meeting in June and told us how her husband had been laid off and she worked in a part-time job. She said she'd been hungry more times than she could count, and that life felt like a maze, because she faced barriers no matter which way she turned. But despite all of this, Tianna has hope. She still believes that her 8-year-old daughter will be president one day. And she believes that this election can make all the difference in the world to her and her family. Let's prove her right."", ""As a country, we have a moral obligation to give her family and every family a chance to rise up and reach their dreams. That is what's at stake in this election. It's not about golf course promotions or birth certificate. It comes down to"", 'who will fight for the forgotten, who will invest in our children, and who will really have your back in the White House.', ""We need ideas, not insults, real plans to help struggling Americans in communities that have been left out and left behind, not prejudice and paranoia. We can't let Barack Obama's legacy fall into the hands of someone who doesn't understand that, whose dangerous and divisive vision for our country will drag us backwards. Instead, we need to come together, to get incomes rising with a higher minimum wage, to invest in neglected communities with efforts like Jim Clyburn's 10-20-30 plan, to get guns out of the hands of dangerous people, to fight for a criminal justice system that actually delivers justice, and to make sure that all kids have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip codes they live in."", ""When you really think about it, the choice this November is about so much more than Democrats and Republicans. As Michelle Obama said at the Democratic convention, it's about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives. It's also about the kind of country we want to be, what we want to leave behind for future generations. I thank everyone here, who has been fighting for this vision over so many years. I thank all who have supported me. I want you to know I'm not taking your vote or anyone's vote for granted. I'm working every single day to earn your support. And I need your help over the next 52 days to bring our campaign across the finish line together."", 'Barbara Jordan famously said that a government is invigorated when each of us is willing to participate in shaping the future of this nation. So to everyone here tonight, please, keep doing what you\'re doing, but also help to register voters. Tell others about the clear choice in this election. In some states, early voting is nearly here, so we need to keep the pressure on. Let\'s send a loud and clear message once and for all: We are stronger together.

56,            Hillary Clinton          ,"September 19, 2016","['""Thank you. Thank you, Temple! I am so delighted to be here with all of you. I saw how much fun President Obama had last week and – I wanted to be here in Philadelphia.', 'Before I begin with my remarks, I do want to say how proud I am of our brave first responders working to keep us safe after the attacks of the last weekend in New York, New Jersey and Minnesota. There are now reports of a suspect in custody, but we must remain vigilant. This is a fast-moving situation and a sobering reminder that we need steady leadership in a dangerous world.', ""I'm here to talk about a number of the issues that are part of this election but really, much more than that, they are part of our future – the kind of country we want to have, the kind of people we want to be and, particularly, what kind of opportunities we should be providing for the young people of America. I have a proud Owl on my staff, Jamira Burley. A Philadelphia native who became an activist working to end the epidemic of gun violence right here in Philadelphia. She loves Temple and we love her. And I also want to thank Lauren for that introduction."", ""Jamira and Lauren are two examples of why I do have so much faith in our future. Your generation is the most inclusive, progressive and entrepreneurial that we've ever seen. And as you heard, when Lauren was in college, she saw challenges facing students of color, but there was no NAACP chapter to support them and promote diversity and inclusion on campus – so she started one. And Lauren remains committed and engaged, working with an organization called Generation Progress, because she understands that active citizenship is a lifelong job and the call to service never fades."", ""Now, I know that with so much negativity out there, it is really easy to get cynical – especially about our politics. I remember wrestling with that challenge when I was a student during the Vietnam War. It can be tempting to think that no one will tell you the truth and nothing's ever going to change. But you're here today because you refuse to accept cynicism. You know that the next 50 days will shape the next 50 years. And you see how much needs fixing in our country, from the soaring cost of college to the scourge of systemic racism to the threat from climate change – but you also know the only way we can meet those challenges is if we meet them together."", ""You're here today because you believe we can do just that. You want something to vote for, not just against. Optimism, not resentment. Answers, not anger. Ideas, not insults. Bridges, not walls. You're also here because you know this election isn't a reality TV show. It shouldn't be about birth certificates or name-calling or stunts to get onto cable news."", ""This election comes down to a choice between two very different visions for America. I believe it's wrong to tear each down. We should be lifting each other up. It's wrong to let income inequality get even worse. We have to make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. And it's wrong to put a loose cannon in charge who could start another war. We should work with our allies to keep us safe."", 'It comes down to this: Are we going to pit Americans against each other and deepen the divides in this country, or are we going to be, as I know we can, stronger together?', ""I know what I believe, and I'm going to close my campaign the same way I started my career – fighting for kids and young people and families. That has been the cause of my life. And it will be the passion of my presidency, and I hope you'll join me. We can't get distracted when the media or my opponent turns this election into a circus. My husband has a saying about that. He calls it majoring in the minors – getting so wrapped up in stuff that doesn't matter, you forget what's really important to your future and to the future of this country."", ""Take the challenges facing young Americans today. First of all, if you're willing to work hard, you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark in the world. But that's been out of reach for too many young people – trying to find your footing in the wake of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. That's why Tim Kaine and I have a plan to work with both parties and make a historic investment in good new jobs. We can create millions of jobs and make life a lot better by doing things like connecting every household to broadband by 2020; installing half a billion solar panels; building a cleaner, more resilient electric grid with enough renewable energy to power every home in the country."", 'Next, getting an education should give you a boost, not hold you back. But as you know better than most, tuition keeps going through the roof and debt keeps piling up. I understand that Temple was founded to democratize, diversify and widen the reach of higher education. That is still a vital goal.', ""So I worked with Bernie Sanders on a plan. We came up with a plan that makes public college tuition-free for working families and debt-free for everyone. And if you already have debt, we will help you refinance it and pay it back as a percentage of your income so you're never on the hook for more than you can afford. You can actually see how much you and your family can save under our plan by looking at the College Calculator at hillaryclinton.com."", ""And here's something we don't talk about enough: a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job in America. People should be able to learn a skill, practice a trade, and making a good living because of that. So we're offering new tax credits to encourage companies to offer paid apprenticeships that let you earn while you learn and do more to dignify skills across the board – for welders, machinists, health technicians, coders, and so many other fields."", ""Another challenge I hear about all the time is from new parents about how hard it is to balance the demands of work and family in today's economy. Families look different today than they did decades ago, I think we can all agree. Most need two incomes just to get by. And many people now change jobs frequently and have wildly unpredictable schedules, or they have to cobble together part-time work, all without the basic supports available to parents in nearly every other advanced country."", ""That's why Tim Kaine and I have a plan to help working families with quality, affordable childcare, preschool and paid family leave. We fundamentally believe – the more we can strengthen families, the stronger we will be as a nation."", ""Everywhere I go, young people also share their concerns about the divisiveness and discrimination we see in America today. You aren't – and you shouldn't be – satisfied with the progress we've made. You should keep wanting to right wrongs and fight for justice and dignify for all. We see, as Lauren said, too many young black men and women made to feel like their lives are disposable; too many immigrants living in fear of deportation; too many young LGBT Americans bullied; too many young women and men sexually assaulted on campus or in the military or at home. And more than previous generations, you understand that all these challenges are intersecting, and we must take them on together."", ""But you also see a Republican nominee for president who incites hatred and violence like we've never seen before in any campaign. Hate speech being normalized. The dog whistles are out in the open. And yet, despite this, I remain convinced America's best days are ahead of us. In large part, that's because of the inspiring young people I meet every day."", ""I'm inspired by Astrid. I met her in Las Vegas last summer. She was brought to this country from Mexico at the age of four with nothing but a doll, a cross, and the dress she was wearing. Now she's in her twenties and advocating for the rights of undocumented Americans and comprehensive immigration reform. We should all join her in this."", ""I'm inspired by Mikey, who I met in New York. Mikey spent six months in prison for a low-level drug offense. After he got out, Mikey discovered just how hard it is for people who've done their time to find good jobs and opportunities. But he persisted, and he managed to start his own ice cream shop in New York – and I can recommend, it's delicious. We have to do more to help others get that second chance, including by banning the box and reforming our criminal justice system."", ""I'm inspired by Erica, one of the bravest young women I've ever met. Her mother, Dawn, was the principal of Sandy Hook School who died trying to protect her students. Erica was devastated. But then, she made it her mission to advocate for commonsense gun safety reforms. It's been painful for her – a lot of hate has come her way and the gun lobby is so powerful – but Erica won't give up. As she said, 'What if everyone who faced tough odds said, it's hard, so I'm going to walk away? That's not the type of world I want to live in.'"", ""That's the spirit that makes this country great – we might get knocked down, but we get right back up again. And we refuse to quit, no matter what. And that's the spirit we need in this election too."", ""Now, I know that with Washington paralyzed by big money and partisanship, the gap between the change we want and the progress that politics should deliver can look like a chasm. I also know that even if you're totally opposed to Donald Trump, you may still have some questions about me. I get that. And I want to do my best to answer those questions."", ""When it comes to public service, the 'service' part has always easier for me than the 'public' part. I will never be the showman my opponent is – and you know what, that's okay with me. And it's also true I do spend a lot of time on the details of policy, like the precise interest rate on your student loans, right down to the decimal. But that's because it's not a detail for you. It's a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president."", ""So here's what I ask any voter who is still undecided: Give us both a fair hearing. Hold us accountable for our ideas, both of us. I can't promise you'll agree with me all the time, but I can promise you this: No one will work harder to make your life better. I will never stop, no matter how tough it gets. In fact, you can read about what Tim and I want to do. We're not keeping it a secret. We've got a book called 'Stronger Together.'"", 'But let me tell you a little bit about the values that drive me and my vision for the future because you deserve that from anyone from anyone running for president. I want to share with you the stories of three women who at pivotal moments changed my life and set me on a course of social justice, activism, and public service.', ""The first woman is my mother. Her name was Dorothy, and she was abandoned by her parents as a young girl. She ended up out on her own at 14, working as a housemaid. When I learned about this many years later, I asked how she managed to grow up into a warm, loving person and not become bitter and broken. And here's what she said, one word: 'kindness.' She was saved by the kindness of others. Like the teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share. The lesson she passed on to me was simple but powerful: No one gets through life alone. We have to look out for each other and lift each other up. She made sure I learned the words of one of the creeds of our Methodist faith: Do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can."", ""That mission guides me still today. When I stumble, it helps pick me up, because there's always more good to do and more people to help if we keep our eyes open, especially kids."", 'When I met a terrified little girl in Nevada who burst into tears because she worried her parents would be deported, it hit me right in the gut. I knew how hard-working her parents were. I knew the sacrifices they were making so that she could have a better life. When I met a little boy in Flint, Michigan who got sick from drinking water poisoned with lead, it just made me so angry and determined to work even harder. Every one of our children deserves the chance to share in the promise of America.', ""The second woman I want to tell you about is Marian Wright Edelman. She was a lawyer for the NAACP in Mississippi, first African American woman to pass the Mississippi bar. She was an ally of Dr. King and Robert Kennedy, and the founder of the Children's Defense Fund, an altogether remarkable person. One day during my first semester in law school, I saw a flyer – we used to have those, flyers on a campus bulletin board. And Marian was coming to give a lecture. I made sure to be there, and what I heard was captivating. Marian talked about creating a Head Start program in Mississippi and using her legal education to make life better for poor children and families. Something just clicked in my brain. I began to see how I could translate the commitment to helping others I'd learned from my mother, my church, into real social change. I went up to her and I said, 'Could I work for you this summer?' She said, 'Sure, but I can't pay you.' I said, 'Well, I am paying my way through law school, so I have to get paid.' She said, 'Well, if you can figure out how to get paid, you can have a job.' So I figured out how to get a grant to get paid and went to work for her."", ""After graduation, I could have followed my classmates to a high-powered law firm, but I went to work for Marian at the Children's Defense Fund instead. She sent me door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school back then. And I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted an education, but it just didn't seem possible. My heart went out to her and I wanted to help. But it became clear to me that simply caring is not enough. That wouldn't force the public school to build more wheelchair ramps or put more resources into special education. I learned that to drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. So we gathered evidence. We built a coalition. And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. And that experience turned me into a lifelong advocate for children and families."", ""I went to South Carolina to investigate the plight of 12- and 13-year-old boys imprisoned alongside grown men who had committed serious felonies. In Alabama I helped expose the racism of segregated academies. In Arkansas I ran a legal aid clinic that provided representation to poor families and prison inmates who could not afford it. When Bill was elected President, a lot of people were surprised, and even threatened, by the idea of an activist as First Lady. But I wasn't about to quit then, either. I fought for universal health care, and ended up working with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers eight million kids today."", ""The third woman who changed my life was named Sophia, the 17-year-old captain of a high school basketball team in New York City. It was the late 1990s, and Democrats in New York were urging me to run for the Senate, and I kept telling them no. After all, no First Lady had ever done anything like that. I myself hadn't run for anything since student council. I'd always been an advocate, not a politician. But then one day I visited that school in New York for an event with young women athletes with Billie Jean King. Hanging above our heads was a big banner that said, 'Dare to compete.' Before my speech, Sophia introduced me. She was tall, and as we shook hands, she bent over and whispered in my ear, 'Dare to compete, Mrs. Clinton. Dare to compete.' Once again, something just clicked. For years I had been telling young women to step up. Participate. Go for what you believe in. Could it be I was afraid to do something I had urge so many others to do?"", ""Well, it was a difficult transition, becoming a candidate for the first time back in that New York Senate race. Even all these years later, I confess I don't enjoy doing some of the things that come naturally to most politicians, like talking about myself. But I took that leap then for the same reason I'm running now, to even the odds for those who've got the odds stacked against them, especially children and families. And I've learned that in a democracy, if you want to help the greatest number of people, you have to push for reform from both the outside in and the inside out. We need activists and advocates, entrepreneurs and innovators, teachers and mentors, people who change lives every day in a million quiet ways. We also need strong, principled leaders who can win votes, write laws, allocate resources, and do the slow, hard business of governing."", ""Now, of course, politics can be discouraging. This election in particularly can be down-right depressing sometimes. But it matters. It really does. It matters for our families, our communities, and our country and the world. Our most cherished values are at stake. Every election is important, from school board to state senate to president. But this time is different. We are facing a candidate with a long history of racial discrimination in his businesses, who retweets white supremacists, who led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black President, and he's still lying about it today. He refuses to apologize to President Obama, his family, and the American people. We have to stand up to this hate. We cannot let it go on."", ""And when we do that, we send a clear message: America is better than this. America is better than Donald Trump. Just as important, we have a chance to make real progress together in our country. I need you. I need you as partners, not just for winning this election, but for driving real change over the next four years. The fights ahead of us are bigger than one election, one president, or even one generation. It's going to take all of us working side-by-side to build the kind of future we want. That's why, if I'm in the White House, young people will always have a seat at any table where any decision is being made."", ""So if you believe diversity is America's strength, not America's burden, join us. If you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage and no one working full-time should have to raise their children in poverty, join us. If you believe that climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs, join us. If you believe that every man, woman, and child in America has the right to affordable, quality health care, join us. If you believe we should finally guarantee equal pay for women, join us."", ""And here's how you can join us. Go to iwillvote.com and register today. Register your friends.

So talk to your classmates. Talk to your neighbors. Help us stand up for our best values and reject prejudice and paranoia."", ""You know, I mentioned my mother and the kindness she experienced. Her life was so neglected that when she went to work as that housekeeper/babysitter at the age of 14, it was the first time she ever saw a family that loved each other, where the parents loved their children, cared for them, planned for them, where she learned the lessons that enabled her to be such an extraordinary mother to me and my brothers. Everything I've learned in my life convinces me that love trumps hate."", 'So please join us in working together. There\'s no doubt in my mind that young people have more at stake in this election than any other age group. And when you turn out and vote this fall, we will be sending a message much larger than even the outcome. We will say we can build a future where all our children have the opportunity to live up to their God-given potential, no matter who they are, where they\'re from, what they look like, or who they love. That\'s the America we believe in. That\'s the America worth fighting for. That\'s what we\'ve got to do to stand together. We are stronger together, and let\'s make sure love trumps hate. Thank you all!""']"
57,            Hillary Clinton          ,"September 21, 2016","['""Hello, Orlando! Wow. Thank you all so much. I am so happy to be back and I want to thank all of you for being here today at the Frontline Outreach Youth and Family Center, which does so much good work in the community. I want to acknowledge your terrific mayor, Mayor Buddy Dyer, who was here earlier. I want to thank Pastor Wynn, Tiffany Namey, the chair of the Orange County Disability Caucus, and everyone – especially Val Demings. Where\'s Val? Val – I know – got this crowd really whipped up, and I want you to stay whipped up for Val. She is going to be a great member of Congress for everything that we care about and are fighting for.', ""I want to thank Anastasia for that introduction. Didn't she do an amazing job? I first met Anastasia when she was nine years old. She raised her hand at a town hall and she said, 'My twin sister can't speak. Because of that, they put her in a separate class, apart from the rest of the kids. But she can communicate with a computer. And she's very smart and would do just as well as anyone else, if the principal and teachers would just give her a chance.' I was just blown away by this nine-year-old girl – her confidence and how much she loved her sister."", ""So Anastasia and I have stayed in touch over the years. When she grew up, she became an intern in the Senate. I was so proud of her speech at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia too. And I'm very excited that she's here with us today."", ""I also want to thank Orlando. It's great to be back in this wonderful city with all of you. You've been through a lot this year. And what has been so notable is you've responded with grace. You've shown the world what Orlando is made of – strength, love and kindness. This is something we could all use more of right now."", ""I'm here today to talk about how to make our economy work for everyone, but first, I need to say something about two very upsetting incidents that took place over the past few days. First, an unarmed man named Terence Crutcher was shot and killed by a police officer in Tulsa. Then, a man named Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer in Charlotte. I'm sending condolences and prayers to their families; I know a lot of you are as well."", ""There is still much we don't know about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters. It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable."", ""We also saw the targeting of police officers in Philadelphia last week. And last night in Charlotte, 12 officers were injured in demonstrations following Keith Lamont Scott's death. Every day, police officers across our country are serving with extraordinary courage, honor and skill. We saw that again this weekend in New York and New Jersey and Minnesota. Our police handled those terrorist attacks exactly right. And they likely saved a lot of lives. I've spoken to many police chiefs and other law enforcement leaders who are as deeply concerned as I am and deeply committed, as I am, to reform. Why? Because they know it is essential for the safety of our communities and our officers. We are safer when communities respect the police and police respect communities."", ""I've also been privileged to spend a lot of time with mothers who have lost children, and young people who feel that, as far as their country's concerned, their lives seem disposable. We've got to do better. And I know we can. And if I'm elected president, we will – and we will do it exactly together, which is the only way it can be done."", ""Look, I know I don't have all the answers. I don't know anyone who does. But this is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have."", ""Sybrina Fulton has become a friend of mine. Her son, Trayvon Martin, was killed not far from where we are today. Sybrina says, 'This is about saving our children.' And she's absolutely right. We need to come together, work together – white, black, Latino, Asian, all of us – to turn the tide, stop the violence, build the trust. We need to give all of our kids, no matter who they are, the chance to grow up safe and healthy in their communities and in our country."", ""Now, there are so many issues we need to take on together, and that's why we're here today. Because in just 48 days – can you believe it, 48 days – Americans will go to the polls and choose our next president. Well, I hope so. I hope so. I want to just stress that our campaign is about the fundamental belief that, in America, every person, no matter what you look like, who you are, who you love, you should have the chance to go as far as your hard work and dreams will take you. And that is the basic bargain that made our country great, and it's our job to make sure it's there for you and future generations."", ""Building an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, is the central challenge of our time. And I take it personally, because I'm a proud product of the American middle class. My grandfather started working in a lace mill in Scranton, Pennsylvania, when he was just a boy, and worked there for 50 years. Thanks to him, my dad was able to go to college and then start his own small business, printing fabric for draperies. And because of my dad and my mom, I could head out into the world and follow my dreams."", 'Every American family should be able to write a similar story for themselves and their children. And history has shown us – our history has shown us that the strongest growth in our economy is inclusive, broad-based growth – when everyone can contribute to our prosperity and share in its rewards.', ""Now, here is just one example. The flood of women into the American workforce over the past several decades was responsible for more than $3.5 trillion in economic growth. But as women's labor participation has slowed in recent years, due in part to our failure to provide family-friendly policies like paid leave and affordable childcare, so our economic growth wasn't as strong as it could have been. Women who want to work deserve to work. And whenever they are denied that opportunity, it's not fair to them – and we all lose out. In a competitive 21st century global economy, we cannot afford to leave talent on the sidelines. When we leave people out or write them off, we not only shortchange them and their dreams, we shortchange our country and our own futures."", ""That's one reason why I care so much about supporting working parents. It's one reason why I'm such a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform. Because bringing millions of undocumented workers into the formal economy will decrease abuse and exploitation, and it will increase our economic breath and our tax base. It is estimated if we did this, despite what you hear from the other side, we would increase our gross domestic product by an estimated $700 billion in 10 years. Now, we need that."", ""It's also one reason why we've got to break down barriers of systemic racism, including under-investment that has held communities of color back for generations. That's part of building an inclusive economy, too. And it's why I believe we need to do more to help young people, who are left behind in the wake of the Great Recession, find those strategies and opportunities that will get them moving ahead again. And we've got to help older Americans who've displaced by automation and outsourcing in our changing economy."", ""And too often, training and retraining doesn't work as it should. If you don't have a four-year degree, if you haven't really had the chance to upgrade your skills over the years, it's hard to just make a course correction. We need to have apprenticeships and community college and technical programs, starting in high school and moving all the way up to older workers. Whether you're trying to start your career or you've spent decades contributing to our economy, you deserve better."", ""Now, these are some of the elements of my plan for an inclusive economy, and I'm going to hold up the book Tim Kaine and I have put out because we've actually put in one place all of our plans. You see, we have this old-fashioned idea if we're asking you to support us, we should tell you what we're going to do. Right? And today I want to focus on one area that hasn't gotten enough attention. It concerns a group of Americans who are too often invisible, overlooked, and undervalued, who have so much to offer but are given too few chances to prove it. Now, that's been true for a long time, and we have to change it."", ""I'm talking about people with disabilities, men and women, boys and girls, who have talents, skills, ideas, and dreams for themselves and their families just like anybody else. Whether they can participate in our economy and lead rich, full lives that are as healthy and productive as possible is a reflection on us as a country. And right now, in too many ways, we are falling short. We've got to face that and do better for everyone's sake because this really does go to the heart of who we are as Americans. I intend this to be a vital aspect of my presidency."", ""I want to bring us together as a nation to recognize the humanity and support the potential of all of our people. And I want you to hear this because this is not well-known. Nearly one in five Americans lives with a disability. Now, some of those disabilities are highly visible, some much harder to notice. If you don't know you know someone with a disability, I promise you, you do. But their disability is just one part of who they are."", ""Across the country, people with disabilities are running businesses, teaching students, caring for our loved ones. They're holding public office, making breakthrough scientific discoveries, reporting the news, and creating art that inspires and challenges us. They're veterans whose service and sacrifice has protected our freedom and kept our country safe. They're working in the White House. Just last year a young woman named Leah Katz-Hernandez became the first West Wing receptionist who is deaf. So when world leaders come to the White House, the person who greets them is Leah. Think of the message that sends about how our nation sees the talent in everyone."", ""And Americans with disabilities are working on presidential campaigns. I know because several of my staff and advisors have disabilities, and they're doing phenomenal work. I'm grateful to them every single day. And people all over America would say the same about their boss, their colleague, their employee, their family member with a disability."", ""Now, over the past few days, our country has taken leaps forward, not just in recogniz-ing the humanity and dignity of people with disabilities, but in making long-overdue changes in our schools, workplaces, and communities so everyone can be part of our shared American life. Even so, not that long ago if you had a disability – if you couldn't see, couldn't walk, lived with dyslexia or muscular dystrophy or some other health issue – that one fact was allowed to define your entire life. Because of that and that alone, the world was closed to you. Not all of it and not for everyone, but for most people, basic essential things that others could do you couldn't and never would. And that was that."", ""I saw this for myself, as Anastasia said, years ago when I was just starting out as a young lawyer working with the Children's Defense Fund. One of my first assignments was to figure out why so many American kids weren't in school. We looked at census tract numbers and we said, okay. How many young people between five and 18 live in this census tract? Then we would look at school enrollment numbers, and there'd be a gap. And we would say, wait a minute. Where are the kids? Why aren't they in school?"", ""I went door to door, along with people across our country, going into different communities. I was in New Bedford, Massachusetts. We saw a notable disparity there, and I soon realized that part of the problem was kids were stuck at home because of disabilities. There were kids who were hard of hearing, kids with intellectual disabilities. I remember one little girl in a wheelchair who was smart, curious, desperate to go to school. But that chair held her back. Not all schools had ramps or accessible bathrooms. Most teachers and aides weren't trained to help her. So she didn't get to go. It felt like the world had said to her, sorry, kid. Your life just isn't going to be worth very much. And she and her family weren't rich. They weren't powerful. So what could they do about it?"", ""That little girl reminded me of another little girl, my mother. She didn't face the same challenges, but she, too, was clocked from a full and happy childhood – abandoned by her own parents, raised by grandparents who didn't want her, and ended up on her own when she was just 14, supporting herself as a housemaid. But then something finally went her way. The woman she worked for encouraged her to finish high school. And that family showed my mother what a happy family looked like. After many lonely years, it was the start of a better life."", ""The core lesson from her childhood was that none of us gets through life alone. We all have to look out for each other and lift each other up. And I remembered that, sitting with that little girl in a wheelchair. My colleagues and I at the Children's Defense Fund, along with others, gathered the facts, and we built a coalition of activists and families across America, and together we helped convince Congress to pass a groundbreaking law saying that children with disabilities have the same right to be educated in public school just like any other kids."", ""So we opened the doors to school, and then some years later I was so excited when the Americans with Disabilities Act finally passed, 26 years ago. It was bipartisan. The notion that workplaces and public spaces belong to everyone was something Democrats and Republicans both supported. And, by the way, I'm proud that some of the Democrats and Republicans who passed that landmark bill are supporting my campaign because they know where my heart is on this."", ""As Secretary of State, I appointed the first-ever special advisor for international disability rights because I wanted America to stand up for the rights and dignity of people with disabilities all over the world. And over the years, I've spent a lot of time working for kids with disabilities. In addition to Anastasia, who spoke at the convention, another young man, Ryan Moore, also spoke there. I first met Ryan when he was 7 years old. I was fighting for health care reform. He was born with a rare form of dwarfism. But he never let that stop him. He's had so many surgeries, we've lost count of them. But his family was always there for them and – for him. And he was the advocate for himself as he got older. Now he's a college graduate working in the technology department of his local school district. And he's just one of the most optimistic people you'll ever meet."", 'Listening to Ryan and Anastasia tell their stories at the convention this July made me think about all the people who never got the chance, never got the chance to get the education, let alone go to college, become forces for change. And I thought about all of the mothers and fathers across America who love their children more than anything and want so badly for them to have every opportunity that they deserve to have in America.', ""I'll never forget something that the actor Christopher Reeve said. Some of you may be too young to know who he was. He was a huge star. He played Superman. He was unbelievably good-looking. He and his wonderful wife were friends of mine. And then he was paralyzed in a horse-riding accident. He once said that he had been thinking about a phrase that comes up a lot in our politics, 'family values.' 'Since my accident,' he said, 'I've found a definition that seems to make sense. I think it means that we're all family and we all have value.' I couldn't agree more."", ""We've come a long way since the fall of 1973, when I was going door to door talking to kids and families. But make no mistake. We still have a lot more work to do. We can't be satisfied, not when over 60 percent of adults with disabilities aren't in the workforce, not when businesses are allowed to pay employees with disabilities a subminimum wage [cheers and applause], not when people with physical and intellectual disabilities are still subjected to stigma and discrimination every single day. We've got to build an inclusive economy that welcomes people with disabilities, values their work, treats them with respect."", ""Now, one advocate after another has told me the same thing, 'We don't want pity. We want paychecks. We want the chance to contribute.' As president, I'm going to give – give them that chance. First, we're going to focus on jobs and incomes. I'm going to fight to give more Americans with disabilities the chance to work alongside those without disabilities and do the same jobs for the same pay and benefits. People with disabilities shouldn't be isolated. They should be given the chance to work with everyone else. And we're going to eliminate the subminimum wage, which is a vestige from an ugly, ignorant past. Good work deserves fair pay, no matter who you are."", ""Second, we're going to work with our colleges and universities to make them more accessible to students with disabilities. To have a truly inclusive economy, we need a truly inclusive education system. So let's raise our standards. For too long, accessibility has been an afterthought. Let's make it a priority in our curriculums, our classrooms, and the technology our students use. It's like what Anastasia said about her sister. She can communicate through a computer. Then let's make sure kids who can communicate that way have the opportunity to do so."", ""Third, we're going to partner with businesses and other stakeholders to ensure those living with a disability can get hired and stay hired. As part of that, we'll launch a new effort we're calling Autism Works to help people with autism succeed in the workplace."", ""Fourth, let's build on the success of the Americans with Disabilities Act by finally ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It has the strong backing of leaders across the political spectrum, and it's a chance to show American values and American leadership. And I have to tell you ever since I was first lady, I have had the great privilege of traveling the world on behalf of our country. When I was secretary of state, I went to 112 countries. And one of the things that I have noticed is how far behind many countries are in how they treat people with disabilities. Very often people with disabilities from the time they are babies and toddlers are locked away, basically forgotten. I want us since we have been the leader in this area to get that ratified and then to demonstrate to other countries what we have done and are doing to give dignity and opportunity to people with disabilities."", ""Now, these ideas are just a start. We're working with advocates to come up with even more. If you've got an idea, we want to hear it. Go to hillaryclinton.com and leave your ideas because we are really welcoming this debate. This issue is very close to my heart."", ""I've always believed that the ultimate test of our society is more than the size of our economy or the strength of our military. It's how we treat our fellow human beings, especially the most vulnerable among us. And on this front especially, I intend for my presidency to move our country forward. Together, we will make our economy and our country more welcoming to people with disabilities because we all win when everyone gets to share in the American dream."", ""Now, if you want some proof, let me tell you this story. It's a story of a woman named Freia David. Now, some of you may have read about Freia in the Boston Globe. I've carried a copy of that article around with me because I loved it so much. Freia has Down syndrome. When she was 21, she got her first job, at the local McDonald's. Her mother was a little worried, as any mother would be. She wondered, would Freia be able to handle being independent? Could she handle the job? Would she even pass the six-month training program? Well, not everyone in her class passed, but Freia did. And then – then she excelled at that job for 32 years. Her colleagues loved her, and she loved them. The restaurant became such a home to her that she'd bring her family there on off days just to hang out."", ""Earlier this year, Freia began to show signs of early-onset dementia. She knew that meant she had to stop working, but 32 years is a pretty good run, isn't it? It broke her heart. One thing that made it a little better is the whole staff threw a party in her honor. Her family hoped a few people might show up. And in the end, nearly 100 people did: customers, colleagues and friends from over the years. The party lasted three hours. And at one point, one of Freia's former managers asked for everyone's attention. She turned to Freia, and she said, 'We love you. We appreciate you. We respect you. And we are all better people for having you in our lives.'"", ""My friends, after years of hard work and treating people right, isn't that what we all want to hear? Isn't that America at our best? We don't thrive on tearing each other apart, or separating ourselves. We know we are stronger together. We believe in equality and dignity for all. And when we fall short, we strive to do better, not to blame and scapegoat but to improve ourselves, to move toward becoming that more perfect union that our founders hoped for. This election is a chance for us to move still closer to that goal, to make sure everyone can contribute to a growing and prospering America, to say loudly and clearly in this country, no one's worthless, no one's 'less than.' We're all of value. In the United States of America, the greatest country in the world, we believe everyone is created equal. And you know what else we believe? We all believe love trumps hate."", 'Thank you all.""']"
58,            Hillary Clinton          ,"September 27, 2016","['""Thank you! Boy! Wow! Thank you! Wow! Did anybody see that debate last night? Oh, yes. One down, two to go. I am so excited to be back here at Wake Tech. I was here 8 years ago, and I was so impressed then with the kinds of programs and opportunities that are offered here to people like Christine that I wanted to come back, of course, to Raleigh, but I wanted to come back here to Wake Tech. When Christine was talking, I was backstage watching her on a screen we had there. And she kept saying about how she was about to cry. I was about to cry. Her story says so much, not just about her but about our country. We are a country of second chances and third and fourth chances for people willing to work for them, get up every day, do their best. That\'s the basic bargain of America. And I was really proud of Christine.', ""Audience Member: We're proud of you!"", ""Clinton: Thank you. Thank you. And I think her – I think her patients at Duke Regional are in for a treat because not only the skills that she learned here at Wake Tech but that personality, that get-up-and-go personality, is going to mean a lot to the people she's taking care of. So Christine, thank you and Godspeed."", ""Now, I have to thank – I have to thank Dr. Stephen Scott, the president of Wake Tech Community College, all the administrators, the faculty, and the students of Wake Tech. Now, Dr. Scott told me that the enrollment's about 73,000. And what a tribute to what this institution represents. And I am a huge, huge supporter. I just see America differently. I think there's nothing we can't do if we make our minds up, roll up our sleeves, get working together, support institutions like Wake Tech, support people like Christine. And that's what I intend to do."", ""Now, I want to thank your mayor, Mayor McFarlane. Thank you so much for being here. State Senator Dan Blue, Jr. I also want to recognize Linda Coleman, candidate for lieutenant governor of North Carolina. Linda came so close last time. And this time are you going to bring her over the finish line? And I'll tell you somebody else I'm really excited about. That is the Democratic candidate for the Senate, former State Representative Deborah Ross. I have watched – I have watched the campaign she's run and the intensity and the incredible passion that she brings to it. I'll tell you what, we sure could use her in Washington representative North Carolina. I want to thank all the elected officials who are here, and I want to do a special shout-out to a long-time friend of my husband's and mine, somebody who we admire so much who did really transform this state during his governorship. That's former Governor Jim Hunt."", ""Now, there's a lot that I want to talk about today. But let me start with this because you may or may not know. Today is National Voter Registration Day. And you see some signs people are holding. 'I Will Vote.' Now, that's not only a great sign that shows you're committed to vote, but it's a website. And you can go to iwillvote.com to make sure you are registered. And I hope you all will, and I hope you'll tell everybody that you know to do the same, because we want to make sure people are registered."", ""And there is still time to get registered here in North Carolina, and I hope that you will, because think about everything that's at stake in this election right here in North Carolina. The very mean-spirited, wrong-headed decision by your legislature and governor to pass and sign House Bill 2 has hurt this state. But more than that, it's hurt people. It has sent a message to so many people that, well, you're not really wanted. You're not really part of us. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody."", ""The other thing your governor and legislature did was everything they could to make voting harder for people. Now, they were pretty blatant about it. Make it harder for people of color. Make it harder for the elderly. And make it harder for the young. Now, some of that's been rolled back, thankfully, because it was so wrong and, I would argue, unconstitutional. But the best way to show, hey, in a democracy like ours we can have the most vigorous, vibrant debate, that's what it's about. But we want everybody to exercise his or her right to vote. That's the way we're supposed to be making decisions. It distorts our democracy if some groups of people try to prevent other people from being able to do that."", ""Now, I have won elections and I have lost elections, so I know what the difference is. But I'll tell you this: I believe in what our founders established for us, to govern ourselves, to continue to widen the circle of opportunity, and that includes the opportunity to be heard, to express yourself, your voice and your vote. And the best way to reaffirm our commitment to that fundamental American value is to show up and vote, and demonstrate the importance of your vote."", ""I believe that we may have a record-setting turnout in this election. Some folks who follow this are saying we could have the biggest turnout we've ever had. Now, that kind of makes sense because you could not have two more different visions about where we want our country to go in the future, and who we are fighting for. But early information is actually quite encouraging. We're seeing spikes in early voting. And we're seeing voting rates among African Americans, Latinos, and young people going up. And for the first time, the estimate is that young people could represent 25 percent of the vote."", ""Now, I would love to see that. Obviously, I hope people vote for me. But I would love to see that because every election is about the future. And honestly, it's more about the future of young people and children than it's ever been because of the difference in the approaches and the experiences of me and my opponent."", ""Now, last night I got a chance – I got a chance to say a few things about what I want to do if I'm so fortunate enough to be elected as your president. And I do have this old-fashioned idea that if I'm asking for your vote, I should tell you what I want to do. And I also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together. You see, I really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren."", ""And I also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together. You see, I really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren. I think about that a lot, in part because I started out working for the Children's Defense Fund. It's always been my passion about what we can do [applause] to help more kids live up to their God-given potential."", ""And during this campaign, people have asked me, 'Well, how did you get interested in that?'And the simple answer is my mother had such a neglected childhood. She was basically abandoned by her parents, sent to live with grandparents who didn't want her. By the age of 14, she was out on her own working in a home babysitting, keeping house. She was basically a maid. And when I think about my mother's own life and how she told me when I was old enough to understand how different her life was than the one that she created for me and my brothers, she would say she was so often saved by the kindness of other people."", ""We overlook the importance of just how we treat each other, the respect we show, the kindness, the love that we show. And I'm well aware that's not something you put necessarily on a campaign website, but I've been talking about it because I think we've got to re-assert our fundamental connection to each other."", ""When my mother was in first grade, she never had any food, and her first grade teacher noticed that. In those days, they just brought food, a little bag of food, then they'd sit in the classroom and eat it, and my mother never had any food. And that first grade teacher noticed that and began to bring extra food but without embarrassing her. She would say, 'You know, Dorothy, I brought too much food. Would you like this sandwich? Would you like this milk?' And it wasn't until she herself was much older that my mother realized that that teacher fed her for that school year, something she didn't have to do, but her love for her students, her recognition of a child who wasn't well taken care of meant that she stepped in."", ""And then when my mother worked as a maid, she really wanted to go to high school. She started working right before she would have been in high school because she had to get out of her grandparents' home. And the woman she worked for realized how much my mother wanted to go to high school, and so she said to her, 'If you get up early – it sounds like Christine getting up so early. If you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school.' And that's what my mother did for four years, she got up early and then she literally had to run, run to get to high school. It sounds harsh, but not for my mom. She thought it was such a great gift of kindness that this woman gave her a place to live, gave her food to eat, gave her the chance to go to high school."", ""So when I talk about us being stronger together, I'm not just talking about what our government needs to do, I'm talking about what each of us can do to contribute. We do need to make sure – we need to make sure that our economy does work for everyone not just those at the top, and that means we've got to make investments in more good, new jobs, infrastructure jobs, advanced manufacturing jobs, technology and innovation, clean renewable energy jobs. And we've got to do more to help small businesses because that's where most of the new jobs will come from."", ""As I said last night, my dad was a small businessman. When he got out of the Navy after World War II, he started this small business printing drapery fabrics, and he had a print plant in Chicago. It was just – it was dark room. There was no natural light. He had two long tables and he'd spread that fabric on the table, and then he would take silkscreens – if you've ever seen one – and he'd start at one end and he'd put it down, he'd pour the paint in, and he'd take the squeegee and he'd lift it up and he'd go all the way down to the end of one table, and then he'd start on the other table, and he would do that until he got the job done. And I would help him out from time to time, so I knew how hard he worked. But he was so proud that he could give us a good middle class life because his dad was a factory worker. And so he was able to do what we want to see in America, keep going, keep reaching, move as high as your hard work and ambition will take you."", ""So I want us to have an economy that works for everyone, to grow the economy, to create more jobs, but I also want a fairer economy because – when you work hard, you should not be still in poverty at the end of the year. But if you are a minimum wage worker, if you work full time minimum wage, you will make $15,000 a year. Two-thirds of minimum wage workers are women, most of them with families to support. And I've talked to a lot of these women. Sometimes I'll be at a café or sometimes I'll be in a store and I'll just start talking to them, and they will tell me – it's one of the most humbling experiences about being out there talking to people is that if you're open to it, folks will tell you what's on their minds and their hearts."", ""So I've met women who are working two full-time minimum wage jobs to make enough to be able to support their kids. So we need to raise the national minimum wage and – and we need to guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work because – number one, it's fair. It's fair. And if your mother, your wife, your sister, or your daughter is working, don't you want to see her paid what she should be paid for the work she does?"", 'And the other thing I want to do, I want to make sure that more companies offer profit-sharing to their employees who help make the profits in the first place. It makes no sense to me that sharing in profits would only go to the top executives. I want more people in more jobs to realize the benefit of their hard work.', 'And last night at the debate, one of my guests was Mark Cuban. Now, Mark Cuban, who is a real billionaire, by the way, he has used profit-sharing from his very first successful business, and he not only used it while the business was going, but when the business was sold. He shared the profits from the sale and made 300 of his employees millionaires overnight.', ""Now, that's the kind of business leadership I want to hold up, because what we've seen from my opponent is someone, who his own campaign manager has said, builds a lot of businesses on the back of the little guy, stiffing people – dishwashers, painters, plumbers, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers – across America. Some of them have come forward. You can go to our website; you can see their stories. It's heartbreaking. And as I said last night, I'm really glad my dad never had a contract with Donald Trump when he was running his small business."", ""And in addition to making the economy fair, we've got to make it work better for working families who are trying to balance family and work. It's really hard out there, isn't it? And just listening to Christine's story – getting up at 4:00 and studying, getting kids up at 7:00, going to school, going to work, going to another job – that's not an uncommon story. We've made it really hard for a lot of people."", ""So here's what I think we need to do, and it's not a luxury, it's a necessity – because I want more families to be able to go as far as their hard work will take them. And I've heard so many stories. They've told me – people have told me about the difficult choices they face and the stresses they're under. So let's finally, since every other advanced economy has already done this, let's have paid family leave so that when you're sick or your spouse or your child is sick or you have a newborn, you can take care of your loved ones. And let's have earned sick days so that you don't lose your job because you're sick or you go to work because you're sick. And let's finally have affordable childcare, which in lots of states costs as much or more than in-state college tuition. I don't think any family should ever have to pay more than 10 percent of your income for childcare, and we're going to fix that so that becomes the norm. And then let's make sure that every educational opportunity is available without sending you into debt and breaking your budget."", ""Now, tomorrow in New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders and I are going to talk about the college plan for debt-free college at public universities that he and I have worked on since the end of our primary. And I want – I want every family in North Carolina to know help is on the way. And we're also going to work so that you can refinance the debt you already have at much lower rates and get it paid off a lot sooner."", ""Now, how are we going to do that? Well, we're going to go where the money is, and the money is at the top. We're going to go after millionaires, billionaires and corporations. We're going to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires, and we're going to close corporate loopholes. And I believe that we can get that done, in part because you're going to send Deborah Ross to the Senate so we're going to have another Democratic senator. But also because our government needs to start working for everybody again – not just those who have lobbyists and lawyers and influence. That hasn't worked out so well. We've got to get back to first principles. Our job is to give the maximum opportunities to the maximum number of Americans and to especially focus on people who are working their way out of poverty and people in the middle class who want to go as far as they can go. Let's be a government for the struggling, the striving and the successful."", ""So I'm excited about what we can do. I really am. And I'm going to leave it to the fact-checkers to go through all of – all of Donald Trump's claims. There were – there was a lot of work for fact-checkers last night. But here's a couple of things that caught my attention. He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share of taxes. In fact, I think there's a strong probability he hasn't paid federal taxes a lot of years. And this is a man who goes around calling our military a disaster; who goes around criticizing every institution, from health care to education, our vets. But he probably hasn't paid a penny to support our troops or our vets or our schools or our health care systems."", ""And when I confronted him with the reasons why he won't release his tax returns – and I got to that point where I said, well, maybe he's paid zero – he said that makes him smart. Now, if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make all the rest of us? I got to tell you, Bill and I have been blessed. We didn't come from millionaire families. My husband's father – his biological father died before he was born. His mother went to nursing school in order to support him. They struggled. They worked hard. And America gave him the chance to get a good education, pursue his dreams, end up being President. My dad, as I told you, worked hard."", ""So Bill and I have released all of our tax returns going back 40 years. And if you look, you'll see that we paid the highest marginal rate. We tried to give 10 percent to charity. Because we believe in this country and we believe with the blessings that we've been given, we should do our part."", ""The other thing he admitted last night was that he actually rooted for the housing crisis to happen. I don't think I'd make a big bragging point out of that. But he seemed to feel like, hey, it shows you how smart I am. He basically said, 'Yeah, if the housing market crashes, I can go in and buy stuff and make some more money.' I got to tell you, what kind of person believes that? What kind of person would want to root for nine million families losing their homes? One who should never be president is the answer to that question."", ""And he made it very clear that he didn't prepare for that debate. At one point he was kind of digging me for spending time off the campaign trail to get prepared. But just trying to keep track of everything he says took a lot of time and effort. And I said, 'Yeah. You know what? I did prepare. And I'll tell you something else I prepared for. I prepared to be president of the United States, and I think that's good.'"", ""So as I said in the beginning, we have two different visions here. I believe we are stronger together. That is at the core of what I've done over my years in advocacy and public service. I believe that America is already great, and it is our responsibility to make it even greater. I believe that as we make our economy work for everyone, we also need to keep our country safe, and we need to provide strong, steady leadership in the world with our allies and our partners. I've laid out my views on a range of national security and foreign policy issues. I've laid out my plan for defeating and destroying ISIS. And what we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent. It's unclear exactly what he is saying."", 'But words matter. And last night it sounded like he was basically telling our treaty allies in Asia, ""Hey, we\'re not sure we\'re going to be there for you even though we have a mutual defense treaty."" Words matter. People here that and they start to doubt America\'s word, America\'s intention. I felt like I had to jump in and say, \'I just want to be clear. We will honor our treaties. We will support our allies and our partners.\'', ""This is not reality TV. This is real. It's as real as it gets. so we're going to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. We're going to keep America safe, provide strong, steady leadership, and we are going to bring our country together across the divides that have pitted Americans against each other. Economic worries are not the only ones keeping families up at night, are they? There's still a lot we don't know about the recent incidents in Tulsa and Charlotte, but this we do know: We've got to bring communities together. We have to listen to each other. We have to make it clear that everyone is safer when there is respect from the law for the communities they protect, and respect for the law from the communities that are protected."", ""And we've got to do something about the epidemic of gun violence that has taken too many, too many lives in our country. Again, I think we can come together. A very long majority of Americans and a majority of gun owners believe in comprehensive background checks. They believe in the Second Amendment, as I do. They believe in the right of individuals to have guns, as I do. But they believe, along with me, that we should not let guns fall into the wrong hands of people who will use them to kill other people, and make it so easy to get them."", ""So there's work to do. But it's great work. It's important work, starting right here in North Carolina. We have 42 days left. This election's going to be close. They all are these days. That's why every call you make, every door you knock on, every friend you register to vote, to make the difference. I want you, if you can, to text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246, or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer here in North Carolina. And I know there's a big overflow room, and I'm told they can hear me, so to my friends in the overflow, we want you to be just as involved as anyone else. Thank you for coming."", ""So remember, here in North Carolina, starting on October 20th, you can register and vote early at the same time at any one-stop early voting site in your county. And remember, it's not just the presidential race. It's the governor's race, the lieutenant governor's race, the U.S. Senate race, and other races up and down the ticket. Because we want to prove who we are as Americans in this election. We're not fearful. We don't want to build walls. We want to build bridges. We don't want to turn against each other. We want to work with one another. We want to set big goals again here in our country."", ""I've got some big goals that I know we can achieve. Take climate change, which my opponent says is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it could be one of the biggest economic opportunities our country has ever seen, and I want us to take advantage of that. Do the right thing and benefit from it. That's what I'm offering. We're going to deploy a half a billion more solar panels in the first four years of my administration. And we will produce enough clean power to power every home in America within 10 years. And we're going to lead the world because some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. Now, the way things are stacking up, I think it's either going to be Germany, China, or us. I want it to be us and it will be us."", 'That is exactly right. I love this country. I\'m proud of this country. I want to be a leader who brings people together in our country, sets those goals, gets about the business of achieving them, and proves once and for all that love trumps hate. Thank you!""']"
59,            Hillary Clinton          ,"September 28, 2016","['""Thank you. Thank you all so much. It is great being here on the stage at UNH with my friend Bernie Sanders, one of the most passionate champions for equality and justice that I have ever seen and someone who I am looking forward to working with to get [cheers] the kind of agenda through our Congress that will begin to make our country stronger by providing the kind of support that working families and middle class families so richly deserve.', ""Bernie's campaign energized so many young people, some of you in this crowd. And there is no group of Americans who have more at stake in this election than young Americans because so much of what will happen will affect your lives, your jobs, the kind of country we are, the kind of future we want to build together."", ""I'm proud of the primary campaign that Bernie and I ran. We ran a campaign about issues, not insults. And when it was over, we began to work together to try to figure out how we could take the issues we agreed on and come together knowing we are stronger together to come up with specific policies in education, in health and so much else. Thank you, Bernie. Thank you for your leadership, and thank you for your support in this campaign."", ""Now, we're going to need some help in Washington. And I hope New Hampshire will send your now Governor Maggie Hassan to Washington as your senator. And I sure hope you will send Carol Shea Porter back to Washington."", ""Isn't this one of the strangest elections you've ever seen? I – I really sometimes don't know what to make of it. Standing on that debate stage the other night, I was especially thinking about that. And, look, I have been very clear about what I want to do if I'm fortunate enough to be elected president. And Americans increasingly are zeroing in on the fact that we're not only electing a president, we're electing a commander-in-chief. We're looking to see who can protect our country and provide steady and strong leadership around the world."", ""I was very honored today to earn the endorsement of John Warner, a retired Republican senator, World War II veteran, former – former secretary of the Navy who served under two Republican presidents. I served with him on the Senate Armed Services Committee. And I have the deepest respect for his patriotism. And it's a great honor. He's never endorsed a Democrat for president before. And I'm also very grateful that a number of Republicans and Independents here in New Hampshire have announced their support for this campaign. In fact, it is really an extraordinary honor that 150 Republicans here in New Hampshire are supporting this campaign because they understand how high the stakes are."", ""The next – the next 40 days will determine the next 40 years. So I'm going to close my campaign the way I started my public service and my career: fighting for kids and families. That's been the cause of my life. And it will be the mission of my presidency. And when you go to vote in November or if you vote early, it's not just my name on the ballot. Every issue you care about, think about it because, in effect, it's on the ballot, too. It's whether or not we continue to fight climate change or we give in to denial. This is a big deal. I never thought when I gave my acceptance speech to the Democratic National Convention that I would have to put in the following sentence, 'I believe in science.' Climate change is real. It's serious. And we have to be united and committed in addressing it. I never thought I'd hear someone running for president, my opponent, who says he wants to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn marriage equality and turn the clock back on LGBT Americans, overturn a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions and reverse that fundamental right and so much more."", ""So there's a lot at stake. And that's why some of the analysts are saying more Americans will vote in this election than ever before. We had more people watching that debate than any presidential debate before. And that's why we have to focus on what we want to do because I want to make a difference in your lives."", ""And one of the biggest issues that I heard about throughout the campaign that I hear about from every corner of our country is how much an education costs. Bernie is absolutely right. I remember when I went to college, my dad, who was a small business man – he had saved up money, but I had to work. I had to work through college, work during the school year, work during summers, but that was okay. We were able to put it together. It wasn't so much that it endangered me or my family's financial future."", ""And then I decided to go to law school, and my dad said, 'Well, I can't help you. That – we're done. We can't help you.' So I kept working. I got a small scholarship, but then I took out loans. And I paid those loans back. But I was lucky because I signed up for a program that gave me the opportunity to pay my loans back as a percentage of my in-come, not a fixed interest rate. That's why I could go to work for the Children's Defense Fund. I think I made $14,000 a year, as I recall. I could never have done that if I had had the kind of interest rates that so many young people now are facing."", ""It's absolutely wrong, and it has undermined the fundamental right to pursue your dreams, to have that education, to get those opportunities that you so rightly deserve."", ""Now, New Hampshire has the highest proportion of students with debt in the country and the second-highest average debt per student. As a student I met here in New Hampshire said, going to college should be hard, but paying for college shouldn't be so hard that it prevents you from getting your education."", ""Indeed, here in New Hampshire, we've got so many young people graduating with debt who aren't able to get started in their careers, aren't able to do the jobs like I could do, because they have to get a job that pays as much as possible to begin paying their debt down. So we should, and we will, make public colleges tuition-free for families earning less than $125,000 a year."", ""And if you already have student debt, like so many students have here in New Hamp-shire, we will help you refinance it. It is absolutely outrageous that you cannot refinance student debt, and it is even worse that you're being charged interest rates that are so much higher than anything that anybody else is paying to buy a house, to buy a car, to borrow money for a business. I don't know how we got to where we are, but we are going to fix it. This is wrong. It's wrong for students, it's wrong for families, and it's wrong for our country."", ""I also have met a lot of young people who want to start a business. They want to be entrepreneurs. It's the classic American story; start that business in the garage or the basement; get going. But they can't get credit because they have student debt. Nobody will help them out, no matter how good the idea is. So we're going to put a moratorium, so you don't have to pay your student debt back for a couple of years while you try to get your business started, and you get the chance to get the credit you need."", ""We are also – we are also going to provide loan forgiveness for people willing to go into public service or national service. And in Florida on Friday I'll give a speech about why that is so important."", ""Now, when you add it up, our plan will help millions of people save thousands of dollars. Our campaign has built a tool to help you see how our college plan will actually help you, not in general, but really specifically you, the situation you're in. To check it out, go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator."", ""Now, we have an example right here, and this presentation is what you can see when you go to our website. You can say, 'I have student debt,' you can say, 'I am planning for college,' you can put in what your annual household income is, how much you will save, and we are trying to make it as specific as possible because I don't want anybody to miss out on what this plan can do for you. You can choose whether you have student debt."", ""I met a young woman just yesterday in North Carolina who said, 'Nobody really ex-plained to me and my family what I was getting into.' I hear that so much. You know, these financial aid forms, one is called FAFSA, it takes forever to fill out, and at the end of it you really don't know what it means? Well, we're going to be really explicit. You know, we do have technology in America. And we ought to use it more to help people understand what they're getting into and to provide alternatives so that they don't make the wrong decisions for themselves."", ""So, please, use this, you know? You will save $60,640 if you're in one of these categories. But there is a way to understand the choices you have to make for everybody. So I hope you will go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator."", ""But I have to say this: none of this will happen if you all don't turn out and vote. None of it. You know, I see all the signs saying, 'I will vote.' There is also a website. Please go to iwillvote.com to make sure you're registered. All the information is there. You put in your name, you put in your address, and through the miracle of technology you can find out if you're registered, or maybe because you moved you were purged from the records and you have to register again. New Hampshire makes it easy. You can have same-day registration."", ""So both Bernie and I are excited about what we can do together. I am really looking forward to working with him and other strong Democrats and Republicans who want to help solve problems again in America. Bringing people together is what I'm going to spend a lot of my time doing as your president. And if you've had a chance to see or meet my running mate, Tim Kaine, you know how hard he'll work to get things done and make it a high priority to produce results."", ""So we're going to move now to the panel, and I'm very pleased to have Mary Jo Brown moderating, along with Doug Martin, who you heard from earlier. I know they have collected up questions from the crowd. But I will end by saying that I'm excited about what we can do to make college affordable, and especially as Bernie rightly said, open the doors to families and young people who have been left out. We also want to make Pell grants once again available year-round, and we want to make sure that we have – specific help for certain groups of students."", ""I'll end with this story. I taught at the University of Arkansas Law School some years ago, and I met a lot of students, not only in the law school but students on campus. I'd go and eat with them and go to events with them, and I met a lot of students who scraped together the tuition money, but then something happened. You know, maybe they were already parents and their childcare fell apart. Maybe they had to drive to and from school; they lived out in the country and their old car finally broke down and there was no public transportation. Or maybe they had a health emergency. And they would come and they would say to me, 'What can I do? Where can I get the $300 to fix the car? Where can I find childcare? How can I pay the doctor's bills?'"", ""And I realized that we've got to take care of tuition, making sure that you can go and be able to start and finish school. We've got to make sure costs and expenses, Pell grants and other ways of helping. But we also have to fill the gaps that exist for a lot of students. So I helped to start something called the Arkansas Single-Parent Scholarship Fund, because the people who had the most unexpected expenses were young parents, mostly, but not always, single moms, young, divorced, pretty much on their own, trying to improve their lives and prospects."", ""And we started a fund to help fill those gaps, and, you know, we did it over so many years now, about 35 years, and we've helped thousands of people, so they didn't have to drop out. They didn't have to cut back. That's what I want for our country again, where we're helping each other, where we're reaching out and giving everybody a chance, and, yes, sometimes a second or third chance, to make the most of their lives, to pursue their dreams. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody, and education is absolutely essential to it."", 'So please make sure you come out and vote in this election. Thank you, all.""']"

And I especially want to thank Janelle for her intro-duction. And I so appreciate that Janelle and Nora and her husband Stu are here today. I remember so well when I met her back in 2015, and I saw that sign. And my best friend from sixth grade was also going through breast cancer and being treated. And when I saw Janelle\'s sign, it just made me think about my friend, and I wanted to go over and meet this woman who had been through 13 chemo treatments already. And we just clicked. And I have been so grateful to be able to get to know her better and spend time with her when I see her. And I got to introduce her to my best friend when my best friend came to Iowa. So the circle is completed, and more people are reaching out and finding ways to help each other.', ""Now, before I came out, I had the great, great privilege of saying hello to someone, Ruline Steininger, who is – is Ruline still here? I know she was going to try to stay. There she is. Hello, Ruline! Hello, Ruline! Ruline is a 103-year-old resident of Pleasant Hill who was born in 1913. I am so grateful for her support, and I don't know if any of you have seen the videos, both about Janelle and about Ruline. But I really do recommend that you see them both. Ruline talks about this long, active life that she's had and everything she has seen happen in America and the world. And I think it's important to have that perspective. So it's a great honor to have Ruline supporting me. I am so pleased. And she's going to go vote early today to make sure her vote counts."", ""I want to thank Dr. Andy McGuire for chairing the Iowa Democratic Party, fighting so hard to elect Democrats. And I want to lift up and thank our Democratic Senate candidate, Patty Judge. Where's Patty? Patty's out there fighting hard every single day, and she can use your help to make a strong case for her to go to the Senate. And Jim Mowrer, the 3rd District congressional candidate. Jim is running a great campaign, and we are really looking forward to having him in Washington. But that really depends upon everybody here and everybody across the great state of Iowa."", ""Now, while we're meeting on this beautiful day here in Des Moines, I know our friends in Cedar Rapids and the region are once again facing the potential of flooding. I talked with the mayor. I talked with city council members and other leaders over the last day or so. They hope that they will not have the flooding. They took a lot of good precautionary measures. Our campaign, along with thousands of people, came out and helped to put the sandbags in to try to prevent flooding. And I told them that if I'm so fortunate enough as to be president, we're going to have a big infrastructure program, and we're going to help prevent flooding in places like Cedar Rapids."", ""Now, I also just want to say on a personal note I was terribly upset this morning to learn about a train crash in New Jersey. That's very personal to me. I live in New York. People commute into New York from New Jersey. We had about a hundred commuters injured and one died. I just want to send our thoughts and prayers to them because it's a horrible accident that ran into the depot and caused all kinds of damage. So I want to lift up the people of New Jersey and New York today."", ""Now, we are starting to vote in Iowa today! And I saw my good friend Ruth Harkin, and she told me she was the first person in line to vote today. And we have, what, 40 days, 39 days, left. And each and every one of you have the chance to make sure that we keep our country on the right path. We have 40 days to win an election that's going to affect the next 40 years of our country. And you, every one of you, can make the difference in this election."", ""Now, how many of you participated in the caucuses? Well, we've got a bunch of active Iowans here. Are you ready to go to the polls? Well, luckily, in Iowa you can start today. Lots of folks don't have that opportunity across the country. And a lot of our campaign volunteers are going to direct people right from this rally to early voting sites. We've got one right down the street. So when you finish here, you can go vote. And we can be on the path to victory here in Iowa."", ""Any of you see that debate on Monday night? Well, one down, two to go. Well, I have to tell you, it was an extraordinary experience because I did get to say a few things about the positive agenda that we want to have for our country because I want this election to be about something, not just against somebody. And so I am going to close this campaign the way I started decades ago, fighting for kids and families because it's been the cause of my life. It will be the mission of my presidency because I know from my own experience that strong families are the base of a strong America. And I know from personal experience how important it is to give people the tools they need to make sure that they can go as far as their hard work, their talent, will take them."", ""Now, you may have heard me say this. I started talking about this way back in the be-ginning of the campaign here in Iowa. But I was very fortunate. None of us picks our parents. But I really was fortunate. My dad was a Navy veteran, a small businessman, and he worked hard every single day to build a good life to provide financial security, a good, solid, middle class life. And I know how hard he worked because occasionally I'd go down to his print plant where he printed fabrics for draperies. And it was not a very big building. It didn't have any natural life. There were no windows in it. It's what he could afford."", ""And there were two long tables. And he'd roll out the fabric, and then he would take a silkscreen. Any of you ever seen a silkscreen, an old-fashioned silkscreen? Not far from here there's a wonderful t-shirt store. Right? And they still use silkscreens for some of their printing. So he would take that silkscreen, and he'd put it down, and he would pour the paint in. Then he'd take a squeegee and he'd go across it. And then he'd lift it up, and he'd go all the way down the table. And if there was going to be more than one color, he'd do it all over again. And then when he finished, he would gather it up and put it in his car and he'd go deliver it to the customer who had ordered it."", ""That's how I was raised to think about doing business. You do your best. You enter into a contract or an agreement. Somebody orders your goods or your services. And then they pay you for it. Right? And as I said the other night, one of the things that we have found out is that as his own campaign manager said about him, Donald Trump has built a lot of businesses on the backs of the little guy. Her words. And I have met people who have been the victims of his refusal to honor contracts, to pay what had been bargained for. I just am grateful that my dad never did business with him or somebody like him because we couldn't have survived all that."", ""All that work, and then to be told we're not going to pay you, or maybe we'll pay you 10 cents on the dollar, or 20 cents? That's just wrong. What kind of person does that, takes advantage of dishwashers and painters and architects and glass installers and so many people? We've been looking into the records, and there's a long list of people who have been mistreated. I just don't believe that's the way we're supposed to treat each other in America. And that sure is not the way our president should be treating our citizens in our country."", ""Now, my mom had a very different story. My dad's father was a factory worker, but they had a strong family. My mom was abandoned by her parents and then sent to live with grandparents, and they didn't want her. So she was out on her own by the age of 14. She was working as a housemaid and a babysitter. And it may sound harsh, but I will quickly tell you that it was the first time in her young life that she ever was in a family that showed love and respect for each other. So for her, it was a gift."", ""And then she got another gift. The woman she worked for knew that my mom wanted to go to high school. And so the woman said, 'If you can get up really early and you can get your chores done and get the little kids off to school, you can go to high school. But you'll have to come right back.' That may sound harsh for a 14-year-old, but for my mother it made all the difference. And that's exactly what she did for four years, and most days she had to run – run – to get there. But she didn't care because she wanted to get an education."", ""So when I learned more about my mom's life, I knew that what I wanted to do was to stand up for kids and families, and especially for kids who've been left out or left behind in some way. That's why I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund and learned quickly that kids with disabilities were not in our public schools back then, and we worked to put together a coalition and convince Congress to pass the law, and boy, every day I am so thankful for your former Senator Tom Harkin, who made the rights and opportunities of people with disabilities the centerpiece of his distinguished career."", ""So that's been my mission: How are we going to do more to help kids and families? And so when I talk about the economy – because I think we have three big issues facing us. Number one, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, right? We need to keep our country safe and we need to lead the world with strong and steady leadership, in accordance with our values. And we need to bring our country together. We have to heal these divides."", ""But when I think about the economy, yes, I want more new, good jobs with rising in-comes. I see my friends from the laborers here. We need to do work that builds our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, our tunnels, our water systems, our sewer systems. This is good, honorable work, and boy, do we have a lot of it in America. We are living off the investments that our parents and our grandparents – and sometimes even great-grandparents – made. If we're going to have a competitive economy, we need to be building America again. And we also need to do more advanced manufacturing. And some of the most exciting developments I saw throughout this whole campaign were right here in Iowa. I saw in your community colleges some of the most advanced training that I've seen anywhere in the country. And I met young men and women who were getting credentialed to be able to leave high school to get good jobs as machinists and tool and die makers, and as designers using 3-D printing. I was so impressed. And I think we need to do that across America. And we need to bring technical education back to our high schools. It was a mistake when we took vocational education out of our high schools."", ""Another way that Iowa has influenced and inspired me is what you've done with clean renewable energy. Now, it wasn't a partisan issue in Iowa. It really got a big boost from your wonderful former governor, Tom Vilsack. But it's been continued over the years. And look at the results. Look how much energy you are getting here in Iowa from clean renewable sources, most particularly wind. Right? And look at the number of jobs – it's nearly 10,000 jobs now that are related to that. Plus the renewable fuel standard, which has motivated people to be creative about using biological material and experimenting with cellulosic material. I was in the forefront of moving toward a clean renewable energy future, and I'm excited by that."", ""I'm running against someone who thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I know it's real. I believe in science. But I'll tell you what else is real. What's real are the economic opportunities, the new jobs and businesses we're going to create by assuming the responsibility to combat climate change, and the young people of our country are going to lead the way to doing that. Now, we also need to help small businesses. Iowa is filled with small businesses. It should be easier to start one, it shouldn't be so cumbersome to deal with all the multitude of regulations. We're going to try to streamline that process. Being the daughter of a small businessperson, I believe in giving people the chance to have their destinies in their own hands. And we're going to work hard. I want to be a first-class small business president, in honor of my dad, and I'm going to do everything I can to help you get started, and grow small businesses."", ""But while we're growing the economy, we need to make it fairer. And here are a couple of things I want to do. Let's raise the national minimum wage, so people who work full-time are not still in poverty. I've met – you know, two thirds of the people on minimum wage are women – and I've met a lot of minimum-wage workers right here in Iowa and across America. Sometimes they have to take two minimum-wage jobs, because a full-time minimum wage job will earn you $15,000 at the end of a full-time year of work. We also could give the biggest boost to incomes, and particularly family incomes, if we finally guaranteed equal pay for women's work."", ""And the other thing I want to do is make sure more companies adopt profit-sharing, so if you helped to create the profits, all of you, not just the top executives, will be able to share in those profits. You know, at the debate the other night, one of my well-known supporters, Mark Cuban, was there in the front row. And he really, I think, unsettled my opponent. But I'll tell you, Mark Cuban's a real billionaire who actually uses profit-sharing, and not only while the business is ongoing, but one thing I really appreciate: first business he sold, he shared the profits with all of his employees. 300 employees became millionaires, because they had a boss who rewarded them for the hard work they did to make it a successful company, all together."", ""And the final point I want to make about this is about family economics. You know, let's tackle the cost of childcare. Between 2000 and 2012, childcare costs went up 25 percent. Incomes barely budged, right? So we're going to increase federal investment, and provide more tax relief to working families, so no parent has to pay more than 10 percent of their income for quality childcare. Now, if you don't have small children or grandchildren right now, you might not realize the cost of childcare in a lot of states is more expensive than tuition at public colleges and universities. A lot of families are just so stressed out."", ""The other thing I want to do is to finally have our country join the rest of the advanced economies, and provide paid family leave, so you can take care of your family members. Now, a lot of people think this is primarily about newborn babies, adopted babies, and of course that's a big part of it. Last year, in Newton, a mom said to me, I'm counting on you to know what it's like trying to take care of a newborn and having to go right back to work. Right?"", ""That's a lot of you. There you are. Okay. And I've got to tell you, I hear that all over. When my granddaughter was born and I was in the hospital with my daughter, I was talking to one of the nurses, and I said, so what is your biggest worry? She said, well, my biggest worry is that so many of these new moms have to go right back to work. Right back to work. But it's not just for babies. It's for sick children, sick spouses, elderly members of your family who are having health problems. There is nothing more important than caring for each other. And I will tell you, it is wrong to make it so difficult for American families."", 'The other big expense for family economics is education. Every one of our children deserve good teachers and good schools, no matter what zip code they live in, right? And we also have to make college affordable. Yesterday in New Hampshire, I was with my friend and my former opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders. I am very proud of the campaign that Bernie and I ran. It was a campaign about issues, not insults. And we shared a lot of the same goals, even though we have different ways of getting there. And so after it was over, he and I sat down and we began to hammer out some ideas about what we could do together. And one of them was to make college tuition free for any family whose income is $125,000 or less. And to make it debt-free for everybody else, so that you only pay what you can afford to pay, without going into debt.', ""Now, right now, Iowans hold more than $12 billion in outstanding federal student loans. An education should give you a boost, not hold you back. And we're going to offer relief to those of you who already have debt. We have 40 million people who already have student debt in America, 300,000 of them right here in Iowa. We're going to help you refinance. It is outrageous that you can get a home mortgage at 3 percent, a car payment at 2 percent, and I met people in Iowa who were paying 8, 10, 12 percent interest on their student loans. I'll tell you what. I am not going to let the federal government make a profit off of lending money to young people to get their educations."", ""And college is crucial, but this is not said often enough. Four-year college is not, and should not, be the only path to a good job that supports a middle-class life. So we're going to have real apprenticeships, not the kind where you're told, 'you're fired,' but the kind where you're told, 'you're hired.' We're going to help more people in high school and community college on the job learn a skill."", ""So I'm excited about what we can do together. I know so much of this campaign has been about, you know, whatever my opponent says, and who he attacks, and who he derides and denigrates. And the list is long. But it's not about that. It's about you. It's about your families and your futures, and each of us should be telling you what we intend to do in the job. Now, I have this old-fashioned idea. I'm asking for your vote. I should tell you what I'm going to do, what my plans are. So Tim Kane and I have actually put out this little paperback book. And I see somebody holding one in the front row. It's called, not surprisingly, 'Stronger Together.' You can pick it up at a bookstore or an airport, wherever they sell paperbacks. And you can see what we're trying to do, and where we're going to get the money to pay for it. And the simple answer to that is, we're going to make the wealthy and corporations finally pay their fair share to support America."", ""Now, my friends, my opponent has a very different vision for America. He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share in taxes, maybe not paying any taxes at all. And what I really find so disturbing about this is he spends all of his time just dumping on America. Calling us a third world country. Saying our military is a disaster. That everything about America is in bad shape. But then it's probably true, he hasn't paid a penny in federal taxes to actually support our military, or our vets, or our schools, or our roads, or our education systems. He actually is proud of the fact that he lets everybody else pay taxes. He says that makes him smart."", ""Well, I'll tell you what, if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make the rest of us? My husband and I have put 40 years of our tax returns out into the public. You can go and look at them, and you can see that we've been blessed, and we're grateful for that. But we have paid the highest marginal tax rates, and we are glad we could, because we have both benefited from this great country of ours, and we want to pass that on to the next generation and the one after that."", ""Donald Trump is also proud that he rooted for the housing crisis back in 2008 and -9. Think about that. Five million families lost their homes. And he rooted for it because he said he could make money off of it. He even said that it is just business. Well, what kind of person believes that – that throwing people out of their homes, foreclosing on them, destroying the dreams of hardworking people is just business? Well, I'll tell you, that's a person who should never be president because they don't understand the American dream and how hard it is for people to make it."", ""So look, I think after – Thank you. I think after what we saw Monday night, we'll have two more debates to be able to contrast and compare. I have no idea what he's going to say the next time. But you know, I will spend some time preparing for it."", ""But we can't do any of the things that I just talked about or anything that you see in our book without your help. The future of our country, the future of our economy and the future of our society will be on the ballot. It breaks my heart to see all the mean-spirited, divisive, bigoted things that are being said in our country. We can have our differences, for heaven sakes. We're Americans; that's in our DNA. But we should respect one another. We should listen to one another. That's the way we're going to get things done together."", ""And so I want you to join this campaign. The election will be close, but we can win Iowa and we're going to win on November 8th. So if you can, text 'Join,' J-o-i-n, to 47246, or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer.

Because we will prove that we are stronger together. And you know what else we'll prove? We will prove that love trumps hate."", 'Thank you all very much.""']"
61,            Hillary Clinton          ,"September 30, 2016","['""Hello! Thank you! Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so very much. Wow, what – what a wonderful welcome. It is great to be here in Fort Pierce in this beautiful theater. I love being in the Sunshine State. I really want to recognize a few people: U.S. Congresswoman Lois Frankel is here as you saw, Randy Perkins, a candidate for Congress, Kim Johnson, chair of the St. Lucie County Commission, Larry Lee Jr., state representative. Everyone, all of the elected officials, all of the students and young people, it is wonderful to be with you.', 'And I want to thank Eileen for her introduction. We know how hard that nurses like Eileen work, and now that she is retired, she is volunteering for our campaign. This woman never quit, and Eileen, we are so glad you are on our team.', ""I am grateful to all of the elected officials, all of the commissioners, the county commissioners, Martin County, St. Lucie, for all you do for the community, but especially for all you did this summer to clean up the algae that polluted the water, that threatened wildlife and made life hard for local residents and businesses. This is a serious and complicated problem, isn't it, for the entire Treasure Coast. And it is a reminder, if we needed it, how important good leadership is. So, I thank all the leaders for their commitment."", 'Now, there are just 39 days between now and November 8th. Just 39 days left in the most important election in our lifetimes.', ""We've got to make every single day count. We have to get more people registered to vote, get more people committed to turn out to vote. We have to drive home the stakes in this election: stronger families, safer communities and an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. And underneath all of the rhetoric and the coverage and the back and forth, this campaign really comes down to two questions. What kind of future we want for ourselves, our kids and our grandkids, and how do we make it a reality?"", 'Now, as I said it the other night – how many of you saw the debate?', 'Well as I said, I now have two grandchildren, and no offense to anybody, the two most wonderful, amazing, extraordinary. A little girl and a little boy. So I think a lot about the future. And you may have noticed that my opponent and I have different views about – well, nearly everything when it gets right down to it – not just about what makes America great, because I think America already is great – but about what we should do to make it even greater, and about that basic question about how progress happens at all.', ""My opponent believes in what I call a 'strongman approach.' He stood on that stage at his convention and described a hopeless, broken nation. I am sorry, I am looking at you. I don't see that. That in no way resembles the strong, vibrant America I know. And here's what he said. He said, 'I alone can fix it.' I alone?"", ""Well, we have learned that that's his way. One person getting supreme power and exercising it ruthlessly. That's why he admires dictators like Vladimir Putin so much. But that's not how change happens in America. It's never just one person, not even someone as powerful as the president. Every good our country has ever achieved has always happened because people have worked together to make it a reality. Not just the wealthy or the powerful – all of us."", 'We see that every day across America, and I bet many of you have been a part of it. Maybe you taught kids to read, right? Or cleaned up your local park, or the beach, maybe you have organized a cancer walk, or you have run a food drive. Whatever it is, chances are you have done something to serve your community. And by extension, your country.', ""How many of you – just think back over your lives – how many of you have performed some kind of service of some sort for your community, for other people. The reason I know you have is because tens and tens of millions of Americans do some kind of volunteering in your hometowns every single year. It's one of the best things about the American people. We are doers. We don't just shrug our shoulders when we see something that needs fixing, we don't get resigned or pathetic, or blame other people and turn on each other to find scapegoats. We roll up our sleeves, we get to work to try to make things better in our neighborhood, our community, our city, our state, our country."", 'This has been our story, the American story, since the beginning of our nation, and it is still going strong today. Now, for many Americans, including a lot of you here, serving our country has included serving in our Armed Forces.', 'People are starting to call out their services!', ""There is no greater service or sacrifice, and we are grateful to our men and women in uniform, to their families and our veterans every single day. But what's so great is that national service can take many different forms, and it's something that I believe in so deeply, that every stage of our lives gives us the chance, from grade school through grandparenthood, to find a way to give back."", ""We've got folks here today from AmeriCorps, which my husband created back in 1993, and I'll tell you, to this day, it is one of his proudest achievements. Because very day, AmeriCorps volunteers are out there. They're building houses, responding to natural disasters, helping people with disabilities find jobs, find safe places to live, and next week, on October 7th, AmeriCorps will celebrate a major milestone: their one-millionth member. I'll tell you, Bill is really excited about this and so am I. And by the way, AmeriCorps has one of the best swearing in pledges I have ever heard. Here's how it starts: 'I will get things done for America.' Isn't that great? I think we should make that a national slogan."", ""Now we also have folks here today from City Year, which is part of AmeriCorps. And every day, they're working with students who are risk of dropping out of school. They're tutoring and mentoring and running after school clubs – all to help young people really discover how capable they really are and to be empowered and to stay in school. I'm really grateful to them."", 'We also have people here today from the Peace Corps, which represents the best of America to the world. Peace Corps volunteers are teaching English in Kosovo, staffing health centers in Nicaragua, supporting farmers in Nepal, distributing malaria nets in Uganda. Both as First Lady and as Secretary of State, I got to see the results of their work first hand. They are making the world a healthier, more prosperous and more peaceful place. Now, maybe not all of you have been a part of one of these programs, but I know you serve in different ways.', ""Maybe you volunteer through your school, or with your church or synagogue. Maybe you find through faith-based opportunities, as I did when I was a teenager, service opportunities. Because for many Americans, service is part of our faith. My running mate, Tim Kaine, volunteered in Honduras with Jesuits as a young man, and it changed his life. Or maybe your whole family volunteers together, Bill and Chelsea and I, every holiday season, would work at a food bank back in Arkansas. However you serve, it feels good, doesn't it? To be part of something bigger than ourselves. To take our time and labor, and put it towards something good that can happen in our country and the world."", ""And you know something very interesting? Service makes us happier, it makes us healthier, and there are studies proving that. It's not just how we feel, they've actually followed people. It can also help us find our next job, or our true calling in life. It's a smart way to use our greatest asset in life, our people. And service does something important for us as a society. Too often, we Americans can become separated from each other, and I think a lot of people are feeling this way during this election."", ""It's easy to surround ourselves with only those that think like us, talk like us, look like us, read the same news as us, that's understandable to an extent. But it comes with a cost because it magnifies our differences, which then makes it harder to put those differences aside when our community or country needs us. There aren't many places where people of all ages, all races, all backgrounds, all beliefs come together in common cause. But service is one of them, and that's one of the reasons I think it's so valuable, because in addition to the good work it does, it helps us reconnect with each other to feel more a part of our shared American life."", ""I believe that one of the jobs of President is to encourage more service, to help more Americans answer President Kennedy's call. You know it: Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country.'"", ""But sometimes it's hard to figure out. How do you make a difference, especially with everything else going on in our lives? And too often volunteering becomes something only people with lots of time and financial security can do. But that's not how it should be. Everyone should be able to contribute."", ""So what if we, as a country, made it easier for everybody to do that, for everybody to give back? What if we created more service opportunities for Americans of all ages, invested in programs that work and encouraged entrepreneurs to add a social component to their businesses? What if we strengthened the culture of service in America so it wasn't just something that we did one day a year, but it became a regular part of our lives. I think that would reflect our values and would tap into something so great about America."", ""I talk a lot about how America is an exceptional nation. We're not exceptional just be-cause of the size of our military or the size of our economy. We're exceptional because of the generosity and ingenuity of our people."", ""Way back, nearly 200 years ago, a Frenchman came to the United States, his name was Alexis de Tocqueville. He was travelling around, trying to figure out, 'What is this new place called America? They fought a revolution. Who are they?' And he saw how we had set up our government, and we had three branches, and everything that our founders really put into place. But the thing that made the biggest impression on him was our spirit of volunteerism that made a democracy as diverse and ambitious as ours possible. If I'm elected president this fall, I want to build on that strength by making a major push in support of more national service. So here's what I plan to do."", ""First, let's triple AmeriCorps. That was the goal of my friend and the great Senator Ted Kennedy. It was laid out in a law named in his honor, the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. It's finally time we get it done. Every year there are hundreds of thousands of more applications for AmeriCorps than there are spots in the program, so if we grow the program from 75,000 annual members to 250,000, we're going to give more people who already want to serve the chance to do so."", ""Then I want to double the college scholarships that AmeriCorps members earn through their service, and I want to find ways for more students to get college credit for service because I know too many talented, committed young people who pass up serving with AmeriCorps because, with their student loans, they can't afford it. So let's lighten that burden. If you do national service, we will begin a program to forgive your loans, because you are giving back to your country. And let's keep working to the ultimate goal of making it possible for any American to serve full time if they want to."", ""Now second, let's grow the Peace Corps. Since President Kennedy launched it 55 years ago, it's given nearly a quarter of a million Americans the experience of a lifetime, and it's fostered friendship and cooperation between Americans and people in more than 100 nations. We've got to do more of that in the world today. We need more Americans of all ages around the world showing our values, serving people. So let's make it possible for more Americans to be a part of this extraordinary program."", ""Third, let's expand service opportunities for people of all ages. Right? Now, let's be fair, the younger generation is way ahead on this. I've talked to so many young people who are deeply thoughtful about how your lives impact others and the world. Service isn't just something to do to check a box before graduation, it really is woven into your lives. And many who are just getting started in your careers, say that having a social impact is more important to you than getting a job that yes, may pay a salary but doesn't give you any meaning or purpose in your lives."", ""Now I also want to get older Americans more involved. Service isn't something only students and young people do. I know that. So I intend to make sure that 10 percent of AmeriCorps slots go to Americans over the age of 55. Let's give people an encore opportunity after they've ended their formal careers so they can apply a lifetime of knowledge and experience to a stronger community."", ""And finally, I want to create a new means for people to serve in serious, meaningful ways without a full time commitment. AmeriCorps is a full time commitment. The Peace Corps is a full time commitment. The Armed Forces are a full time commitment. But the Armed Forces has another model. The Reserves – right? It gives people the chance to make a high impact contribution while still building careers and pursuing their dreams in other ways. So let's do something like that in the civilian space. Let's call it the National Service Reserve."", ""And here's the idea. If you join the National Service Reserve, you will receive some basic training, just like you would in the military reserves, and then when your city or state needs you, you'll get the call. Say a natural disaster strikes and the Red Cross needs all hands on deck. Or maybe, like the crisis in Flint, and clean water has to be distributed every day to a lot of families. Or maybe your city launches a major public health campaign to reduce drug abuse or promote mental health. You will then be sent into action. Now some of these assignments maybe just be for a few days, a month, some might be longer term. But they will directly address a vital need in your own community."", ""And one of the other advantages is you can help meet that need while still being a full-time student, having a job, taking care of your family. You won't have to make service your only priority. Our goal is 5 million people spread across all 50 states, and we will have an open door to people of all ages, but we want to put a special focus on people under 30 who've said again and again they want to have a bigger impact in their communities, but they can't leave their jobs, understandably. We'll work with governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats, because I want this to be a true bipartisan, public-private partnership."", ""I also want to include businesses, colleges and universities who have unique resources to offer. And because we want workers and students to know that as they make this contribution, their schools and their employers will have their backs. I really think a National Service Reserve could make a difference for cities and states. There's so much work to be done and so many people who want to help do it. So let's bridge that divide, get people working together in ways that can help communities."", ""Now, I don't think you'll hear anything about this from my opponent. And you know what? I think that's a shame, because national service has always been a bipartisan goal. Of course, President Kennedy started the Peace Corps and my husband started AmeriCorps – but President Nixon signed the Domestic Volunteer Service Act. President George H.W. Bush created the White House Office of National Service. And both President George W. Bush and President Obama have been huge champions of service. This should be something that we all can get behind. And when you listen to what's being said in this campaign, it can be discouraging, right? It can seem hard to find any common ground so it makes it even more important that we come together where, whenever we can. Now, I am well aware that candidates don't usually focus on national service in the final stretch of a hotly fought presidential election. Some might say, 'Well hey, my gosh, you've only got 39 days to go. Why aren't you just out there beating up on your opponent and doing everything to get the vote out and all the rest of it? Well, I'll do that, but – I've been thinking about this for a long time, and I did not want this campaign to end without talking about it because it means a lot to me. I'm trying to end the campaign focusing on issues that are really close to my heart – and this is one of them."", 'Thank you!', ""For me, service is really all about fulfilling the instruction of my Methodist faith, and you can see part of the creed I like to follow behind me: 'Do all the good you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all the times you can, to all the people you can, as long as ever you can.' Now, I've carried those words with me ever since I heard them as a little girl, and it's an idea that really got into my head and my heart. But you know what's kept me going are the people that I've met. And in a country founded on liberty and equality, I can't think of a more important notion than every one of us is valuable. We all deserve respect. We all should listen to each other. We all can make our mark on the world. And when we come together in common purpose, we can do so much more than we could ever do on our own."", ""That's why 'Stronger Together' is more than just a slogan. It's a course of action. So here's what I want to do. I want you to hear me pledge that this will be a vital aspect of my presidency. And I want you to help me bring our nation together – to solve our problems, strengthen our communities. To join with people across America who care about service, because this speaks to both what is great and good about the United States. America is great because we are good. There are lots of examples. We are going to be putting examples up on my website of people who have served and who are inspirations. But I want everybody here to know that it can be done. We can do more, and we can provide the opportunities to enlist more people."", ""There are so many examples in this community and communities across America – 39 days left. This is the choice: do we lift each other up, or do we tear each other down? Do we listen and respect each other, or do we scapegoat, point fingers, and insult each other? Well, I'll tell you what side I'm going to be on, and with your help, we're going to demonstrate on November 8th, what kind of country we really are."", 'Thank you and God bless you!""']"

We really are stronger together, and that starts in families and neighborhoods and communities."", ""Well, you heard from a lot of my friends who represent you, starting with my great friend and former colleague, your Senator Bill Nelson. And I am looking forward to working with Bill as we make sure to continue the progress that will move us all forward together. And I sure hope Florida sends some reinforcements to the Senate and elect Congressman Patrick Murphy. I think Florida deserves a full-time senator, don't you? And I want to thank my friend, someone who has just worked her heart out not just for her constituents but for Democrats across America – Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. And another great friend of mine going back more years than we care to remember – I'm so pleased he's here with us – Congressman Alcee Hastings. And I know that Congressman Ted Deutch, who represents this district – is over in Israel for the funeral of a great, great man, Shimon Peres, and I want to thank Ted for all of his support and his hard work."", ""Before I get started and really talk about everything that's at stake and what we have to do the next 39 days to make sure we win this election, I wanted to say a few words about the tragic passing of Jose Fernandez. When he left Cuba, he did not speak a word of English. He didn't let that stop him. He pursued his dreams. He wanted to and he became one of the best baseball players that Miami has ever seen. And he never forgot where he came from. He worked hard to give back to the community that had given so much to him. Jose's life really embodied the American dream, and at 24 years of age, he was just getting started. I'm sure you join me in saying that our thoughts and our prayers are with his family, with his fans, and everyone whose life he touched during his extraordinary career."", ""I also want to mention another resident of Coral Springs, and that's a man named Bob Levinson. My heart goes out to Bob's family. He disappeared in Iran more than nine years ago, and it is long past time for the Iranian regime to provide us information about his whereabouts and let him return home to his family."", ""Now, did any of you see the debate the other night? Well, I think it was pretty clear there are two very different choices for our country based on two very different visions of the kind of America that we want to have. My view is we are already great, and if we work together, we will become even greater in the years ahead. I believe America is an exceptional nation. My opponent believes America is in decline. I've never heard such a dark and divisive, terrible image of our country coming from someone running to be president of the United States. When he talks, I lots of times don't even recognize the country he's talking about. And why are we already great? Well, it is not just because of the size of our economy or the size of our military. It is because of our generosity; it is because of our ingenuity; it is because of the diversity of our country. I think our diversity is one of our strongest assets."", ""This morning, I laid out my plan for more national service so that more people of all ages can serve America, serve their communities. Because America is great, when you really strip it all down, because America is good. And we can't ever forget that."", ""I have laid out specific plans about how we're going to make our country even greater. I've actually got a book here with Tim Kaine, my running mate. I have this old-fashioned idea: if I'm asking you for your vote for president, I should tell you what I'm going to do. I shouldn't just talk in generalities and use rhetoric and never answer questions about what we can do, but to lay out how we're going to make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top."", 'That means new jobs – new jobs with rising incomes, jobs in infrastructure, jobs in advanced manufacturing, in innovation and technology, and yes, clean, renewable energy jobs.', ""My opponent's only infrastructure plan is to build a wall. I love that he went down to Mexico and he choked. He didn't even raise it. He's been going around telling people for months, 'We're going to build a wall and we're going to make Mexico pay for it.' So he's sitting with the president of Mexico and he doesn't even bring it up. He finds it a lot easier to insult women than to talk to the president of Mexico about building a wall. I mean, really, who gets up at 3 o'clock in the morning to engage in a Twitter attack against a former Miss Universe? I mean, he hurled as many insults as he could. Really, why does he do things like that? I mean, his latest Twitter meltdown is unhinged, even for him. It proves yet again that he is temperamentally unfit to be president and commander-in-chief. I have said it before and I'll say it again: A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not be anywhere near the nuclear codes."", ""So I'm going to keep talking about what we can do together after this election. Getting those new jobs. And I'll tell you, another area I want to emphasize is small business. As I said the other night, my dad was a small businessman. He made a lot of sacrifice and he worked really hard to give us a good, solid, middle-class life. I'm really proud of that. And I'm sure glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump, who stiffs small businesses, doesn't pay his bills to people like my dad. But we need to do more to get small business started and growing – here in Broward County, throughout South Florida, across the state, and beyond."", ""So as we grow the economy, we also have to make it fairer. I want prosperity to reach everyone, not just the privileged few. So we are going to raise the minimum wage be-cause if you work full-time, you should not still be in poverty. And you know, two-thirds of all minimum wage workers are women, most of them supporting kids. And if you work full-time on a minimum wage job, at the end of the year you've made $15,000. I think we can do better. And I think we should because we want everybody to have a chance to get ahead and stay ahead and go as far as their hard work and talent will take them."", ""Something else we're going to do is we are finally going to guarantee equal pay for women's work. Now, this is not, my friends, just a women's issue. If you have a mother, a wife, a daughter, a sister, who is working, it's your issue, too, to make sure she is paid fairly. That will raise family incomes."", ""And then the third thing I want to do is to make sure – to make sure – more companies share profits with the workers who helped to create those profits in the first place. The other night at the debate, one of my guests was Mark Cuban. He was sitting in the front row. And one of the reasons I was proud to have him there is he believes in profit-sharing. He's always, in his companies, shared profits. And by the way, he is a real billionaire. And when he sold his first company, he shared the profits from the sale and 300 people who worked for him, who helped to make him a success, became millionaires. I want to lift up and use as examples business leaders like that, not somebody who stiffs contractors, who doesn't pay dishwashers and painters and plumbers and glass installers and architects and marble installers and so many else, but somebody who has the right attitude, that we're stronger together in business just like we are in government and America."", ""And the other thing we have to do more of is to make sure that we help deal with some of the stresses that American families are facing. It is hard to balance family and work, isn't it? I think we can do better. I want to see us have paid family leave, earned sick days, affordable childcare, and affordable college that includes tuition-free and debt-free college."", ""Now, after the primary was over – and Senator Sanders and I ran a tough primary, but you know what? I was really proud. We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults. He and I got together and we said, okay, what are we going to do to make sure that more young people can actually get a college education? Because right now, it's way beyond what a lot of families can afford. And if you go into debt, you come out of it with so much debt that remains a burden on you."", ""So the other day Senator Sanders and I were up in New Hampshire together, and we were rolling out our plan. And it's pretty simple. You can go to my website, but let me just tell you briefly. If you are in a family that makes less than $125,000, you will not pay tuition to go to a public college or university. And if you make more than that, you will pay what you can afford, but you will not have to borrow money because it will be debt-free for you to go. And we put together a calculator on my website. You can go to hillaryclinton.com/ calculator and you can see how much you will save, how much your child or your grandchild would save under this plan."", ""But I also believe a four-year college degree, which is an important part of getting an education to get ahead, should not leave you mired in debt. So we are going to help you refinance your debt, get the interest rates down, and if you're willing to do public service, national service, we're going to forgive your debt over time."", 'But not everyone has to go for a four-year degree. I want every person, not just young people but people who are looking for a different opportunity or may have to retrain – I want to everybody to have a chance for a good, solid job. I think we made a mistake when we took vocational education out of high school. We need to put technical education back into high school.', ""And we need to make sure that community colleges are free so that young people starting in high school can take courses at community college to get the training they need for a good job. And I want to see business and labor unions working together for real apprenticeship programs – not the kind that lead to being told, 'You're fired,' the kind that lead to being told, 'You're hired.'"", ""Now, I'm excited about this. I really am. I am confident and optimistic about our country. We never get anything done if all we do is get down in the mouth and feel bad and complain and try to blame somebody for something else. That's not who we are as Americans. We need to lift ourselves up, and we need to roll up our sleeves to get to work to make sure that future is what it should be for our country."", ""And while we're doing that, we're going to make sure that our country's safe and that America provides strong and steady leadership around the world. Sometimes, when I listen to my opponent, it kind of seems he doesn't know who our friends are versus our adversaries. He has this weird fascination with dictators. He's kind of signed up for the Vladimir Putin wish list. He doesn't care whether NATO falls apart, and he is really cavalier about other countries getting nuclear weapons. He said he doesn't care. Let Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia, get a nuclear weapon. Whoa! That's the kind of dangerous, reckless talk that people around the world pay attention to."", ""As I told him in the debate – he actually said, 'Well, we may or may not defend our allies in Asia.' Words matter. And America's word matters. We have to be reliable and trustworthy. People have to count on us. And we've got a lot of work to do around the world. We need to work hard for peace and prosperity. We need to tackle climate change together."", ""Climate change is real. Florida knows that. My opponent thinks it's a hoax created by the Chinese. And what that means is he would not be able to take advantage of the economic opportunities that climate change presents. You see, some country's going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st Century. I think it's going to be either China, Germany, or us. I want it to be us, and it can be us if we make up our minds for that to happen. Let's deploy a half a billion more solar panels. Let's produce enough clean energy so that every home in America can be powered by it. There's so much we can do together. And that means we've got to work with other countries and we've got to demonstrate that we support our allies, whether they're in Europe, the Middle East with Israel, or Asia, that we stand with those who stand with us."", 'And then, finally, one of the next priorities that I have if I am so fortunate enough as to be your president is to bring our country together. I\'ve got to tell you, look, disagreements, political disagreements, that\'s fine. That\'s who we are. I don\'t know any two people in America who agree on everything politically with each other. And I\'ve known, been fortunate enough to know, a number of our more recent presidents. I didn\'t always agree with them either, including my husband. But I\'ll tell you this: Republicans and Democrats alike, I never doubt they were trying to put the country\'s interests first. They were trying to bring people together, not pit us against each other. And one of the things I will do from the very beginning, the very first day of my administration...""', 'Audience Member: ""Day one.""', 'Clinton: ""...is to make them day one – you\'re right – is to make sure everybody in the country knows I\'m the president of every American, every single per-son.', ""Now – so in order for me to do any of this, anything that's in this book and making sure that it's paid for by the wealthy and corporations who have to pay their fair share finally, all of that, depends upon whether we win in November. The stakes could not be higher. So here is what I am asking all of you. How many of you know you are registered to vote? So we need to get everybody to be registered at your current address by October 11th. If you've moved, you may need to reregister. Here's how you can find out if you are registered. You can go to iwillvote.com, iwillvote.com. You put in your name. You put in your address and make sure you're registered. If you need to get registered, we have volunteers here. Right? And they will – they have – they have clipboards. We're kind of low-tech about it. They have clipboards. They can help you get registered right here and now or, as I say, you can go to iwillvote.com and check your registration. And, remember, you can vote by mail starting October 24th here in Broward. And the other thing you can do is convince everybody you know to make sure they're registered and to help them know how to vote by mail so they could get their vote in without making any fuss or inconvenience."", ""So make no mistake. This election is going to be close. They always are. So every call you make, every door you knock on, every person you register could make the difference. So I'm asking you to go ahead and text JOIN, text JOIN, J?O?I?N, to 47246 to get involved or go to hillaryclinton.com. And you can volunteer and become involved. If we win Broward County by as big a margin as we should win it, we win Florida."", ""And, like I say, I'm not just excited about winning an election. I'm excited about doing the work. I'm excited about listening to Americans. I'll continue to travel our country. I'll be here in Florida so much you'll get sick of me because I want to be a good partner for Florida. I mean, Florida is already suffering from climate change, and you have a governor who ordered the state government never to say the word or write the phrase. That's kind of hard to believe. So there's a lot we're going to do together: jobs, rising incomes, opportunities. And that's what gets me excited."", 'So here\'s what I hope you will do. When you leave here, if somebody says, \'Where were you this afternoon?\' you say, \'Oh, I went to a rally for Hillary Clinton.\' If they say, \'Oh, that\'s great,"" get them registered. If they say, \'Oh, my gosh. How can you do that?\' if they\'re seriously thinking about voting for my opponent, stage an intervention, really, because, remember, remember, friends don\'t let friends vote for Trump. And what we believe and what we\'re going to prove on November 8th is love trumps hate. Thank you all so much.""']"

Twelve days since his wife Rakeiya Scott watched her husband die, and seven children lost their father. Now we don't yet know all the details about the shooting, but we do know this family and this community is in pain. And therefore we pray for them and we pray for all families who have suffered similar losses. But we do more than pray. As Ms. Bradford said, 'We do what each of us can do.' Not everyone can march, but everyone can talk, and everyone can reach out and everyone can vote."", 'Too many African American families have been in the same tragic situation that the Scott family has found themselves. In fact, the day before Mr. Scott died, another father, Terence Crutcher, was killed in a police encounter in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And there have been many others. So many fathers and sons and even mothers and daughters who have died either after encounters with the police or at the hands of civilians with guns while they were doing things that were ordinary, everyday activities. Walking home from the store with iced tea and Skittles, listening to music in their car with friends.', 'And we also know -- and we must not forget -- that violence has touched the families of police officers. Men and women who put on the uniform and put their lives on the line to protect others. From Dallas to Baton Rouge to Philadelphia, the families of fallen officers have also been dealt a great blow and they deserve our prayers as well.', ""It's been a hard year, hasn't it? Think about how many times President Obama has had to console our nation about another senseless tragedy, another shattered family, another distressed community. And our children are watching, and they feel it too. You've seen that right here in Charlotte. Last Monday at the city council meeting, 10-year-old Taje Gaddy said, 'I wake up every morning scared that I won't get to grow up because I am black.'"", ""A nine-year-old, Zianna Oliphant, who's here with us today, along with her brother Marquis and her family, also spoke at that city council meeting, with tears pouring down her face. And when I read what she had said, I had tears in my eyes too. She said, 'We are black people and we shouldn't have to feel like this. It's a shame that our fathers and mothers are killed, and we can't even see them anymore. It's a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side.' What courage and clarity that young lady showed to the world."", ""But can you imagine, nine years old. She should be thinking about happy adventures, dreaming about all the wonderful things her future holds for her. Instead she's talking about graveyards. Our entire country should take a moment to really look at what's going on here, and across America, to imagine what we see on the news, and what we hear about, imagine through our children's eyes."", ""I'm a grandmother, and like every grandmother I worry about the safety and security of my grandchildren, but my worries are not the same as black grandmothers. They have different, and deeper fears about the world that their grandchildren face. It makes my heart ache, when kids like Zianna, are going through this and trying to make sense of the absolutely senseless. I know how I would feel. I wouldn't be able to stand it if my grandchildren had to be scared and worried the way too many children across our country feel right now. But because my grandchildren are white, because they are the grandchildren of a former president and secretary of state, let's be honest here – they won't face the kind of fear that we heard from the young children testifying before the city council."", ""You know, every child deserves the same sense of security, every child deserves the same hope. They should not be facing fear, they should be learning and growing, imagining who they can be, and what their contributions to our country could be as well. We've got to take action, we've got to start now, not tomorrow, not next year, now. We know we can't solve all these problems over night, which means we don't have a moment to lose."", ""Proverbs tells us, 'Where there is no vision, the people perish.' So let's hold on to a common vision. Let's come together to make America a place where every child, no matter who they are, where they're born or what they look like, has the chance to live up to their God-given potential."", 'Being stronger together with this common vision means rejecting those forces that try to pit us against each other. We can acknowledge that implicit bias still exists, not just in police departments but throughout our country, without vilifying police officers. We can call for reforms to policing, while still appreciating the many courageous and admirable officers out there who are doing their jobs with honor and integrity.', ""I think about an officer named Montrell Jackson. You might not have heard of him, but I want you to. He was one of the officers murdered in Baton Rouge. A few days before he died, he wrote on Facebook, he was black but he wore blue. 'In uniform,' he wrote, 'I get nasty, hateful looks. Out of uniform, some consider me a threat. These are trying times. Please don't let hate infect your heart.' And then he closed by saying that if anyone saw him on patrol and wanted a hug, 'I got you.'"", ""Montrell Jackson knew that making our communities safer and juster are not conflicting ideas. And most officers will tell you they can't do one without the other. I believe we need end-to-end reform in our criminal justice system, not half measures but full measures, with real follow-through. In America everyone should be respected by the law and have respect for the law."", 'That starts with being honest. Being unafraid to face the facts. Face the fact that black men are far more likely to be stopped, searched by police, charged with crimes and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for doing the same thing. We need to fix a system where too many black parents are taken from their kids and imprisoned for minor offenses. We need to make sure our police officers are trained in de-escalating tense situations. We need to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, and instead invest in education from early childhood through high school into higher education. And yes we have got to fight for common sense reforms to stop the epidemic of gun violence in our communities.', ""Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young black men, more than the next nine causes combined. We've got to make sure there are good jobs, equality affordable housing in every zip code in America. We need to make investments in communities that have been left out and left behind. I am a strong supporter of Congressman Jim Clyburn's plan to put 10 percent of our federal funds into 20 percent of the communities that have generational poverty for 30 years or more."", ""Now, there are some out there who see this as a moment to command the flames of resentment and division. Who want to exploit people's fears, even though it means tearing our nation even further apart. They say that all of our problems will be solved simply by more 'law and order.' As if the systemic racism plaguing our country doesn't exist. Now, of course we need safe neighborhoods, no one is against that. Of course, we need communities that are free from the epidemic of gun violence, of course we need that. But we also need justice and dignity and equality, and we can have both. This is not an either-or question for America."", ""I want us to commit ourselves to this common vision. That is where I will build on the work that President Obama has done. And I will be sure that this is not just about a campaign or an election. This is much bigger than an election. These are issues I've been fighting for since I was a young lawyer working for the Children's Defense Fund. Going to South Carolina to try to get young teenagers, 13, 14-year-olds out of jails with adult offenders. I care deeply about this because it's not just personal to so many of us, it's about the kind of country you want to be and the future we want for all of our children and grandchildren.

To fight for each other\'s children, each other\'s dignity, each other\'s opportunity as if they were our own. Now, make no mistake, this is not easy work. You\'ve been doing this since Adam and Eve came here. But it is righteous work. Protecting all of God\'s children is America\'s calling.

I'm obviously delighted to be endorsed by someone who has demonstrated such leadership and such extraordinary ability. But I'll tell you what really moved me the most is he's given back to his hometown. He has advocated for small businesses, for kids, giving kids more opportunities. He's spoken out on behalf of criminal justice reform. He is someone who uses the platform he has earned because he has worked so hard over so many years to speak out and speak up for those who may not have a voice.

If you're willing to work for it and do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in America."", ""Now, my opponent and I have a really different view about what it takes to get ahead and stay ahead, and that may be because we have very different life experiences. And that's okay. People have different families, different views of the world. But here's what I have noticed. I have noticed that he always puts himself first. And maybe that's because he was born into a millionaire family. He started his business with a $14 million loan from his father. His father bailed him out; apparently that's a pattern, you got to be bailed out when you do business with him. And he then has taken advantage of every single element of our tax code, of our economy, that he could."", ""And along the way, along the way, he has stiffed people – small businesses and workers and contractors. And that's part of the reason I take this election so seriously. My dad was a small businessman. My grandfather was a factory worker. And so my dad, when he got out of the Navy in World War II, he started a small business. He started a printing business. He printed fabrics for draperies. And he worked really hard. He had a print plant in Chicago – no natural light, no windows, just a long room where there were two big, long tables, and the fabric would be laid out on them. And then if you've ever seen silkscreens, that's what he did. You take the silkscreen. You put it down. You pour the paint in. You take the squeegee. You go across. You lift it up. You go down to the end of one long table, you start on the end of the other long table. And then, if it was going to be two colors, you would add another color, doing exactly the same thing. It was before there was machines. My dad couldn't have afforded that anyway. But he worked really hard, and he produced a good middle class life for our family."", ""And so when I think about the way that my opponent has taken advantage of people, I got to tell you, I am really grateful my dad never got a contract from him, because I have met people he stiffed. I have met people. I'm talking painters and plumbers. I'm talking dishwashers, marble installers, glass installers, architects, a man who sold him pianos for one of his casinos. He wouldn't pay them. Now, you got to stop and ask yourself, what kind of person does that? Somebody who works hard and has a contract which they expect to be honored."", ""And so I met one of the men. I met a man who had a small family business, installed the glass in one of those casinos, submitted the bill, and Trump said, no. we're not going to pay it. And the man was stunned, as so many hundreds and hundreds of people have been. And then they come back, the Trump organization or Trump himself, and say, okay, we'll give you 10 cents, 20 cents, maybe 30 cents on the dollar. Now, some of those small businesses, they couldn't afford that. They had bought the material, They had provided the services. Trump didn't care. He basically just walked away from them, made them feel like they had failed even though they had done the work they'd been asked to provide. I got to tell you, that is not the way we're supposed to do business in America. And I can't imagine having a president who believes that that's the way you're supposed to treat people. But you're going to help me make sure he never gets near the White House."", ""Now, earlier today, earlier today in Toledo, I talked about all of the changes I want to make in how we can protect Americans from the kind of corporate fraud that we have seen too much of. Now, the most recent example is Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo actually had people, thousands of their employees, putting customers into accounts they either never asked for or they did not understand. And then every time they put somebody into a new account, they got fees, which then gave them the chance to get a bigger bonus – a really crummy game that hurt people. So thankfully, we have an organization now, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau in Washington, who looks out for people who get [...]. That is an important part of how we're going to protect. And it's run, you may know, by Richard Cordray from Ohio."", ""Now, will it surprise you that Donald Trump wants to eliminate that agency? Well, we're not going to let that happen. That agency has already recovered $11 billion for consumers who've been taken advantage of by corporations. And the behavior of Wells Fargo shows clearly that we have got to keep the pressure on these big banks so they can never wreck the economy again the way they did back in 2008."", ""I have said we're never going to let Wall Street wreck Main Street again, and I mean it. Contrast that – contrast that with my opponent. He wants to do away with the rules that have been imposed on Wall Street. He basically wants to let Wall Street, the banks, the hedge funds, all these other institutions basically do whatever they want again. Well, I'll tell you what, we're not going to let that happen. We need more rules, not fewer rules on them."", 'I want us to make it easier to start a small business, to get rid of the red tape, to make credit available, to make it clear that most new jobs are going to come from small businesses in America, so we should have a big, dynamic small business economy. But we are not going to let big business and big corporations call the shots anymore. That is not working for us.', ""But Trump's whole economic vision is really trickle-down economics. It's the same – the same idea that has failed us before. You see, he believes that all you do is cut taxes on the wealthy and then it trickles down. Well, we know that doesn't work. We've been down that road. And what he wants to do is, I think it's fair to say, trickle-down on steroids. What he has proposed would slash taxes on the wealthy."", ""Now, I'm a little confused about this because for a long time we've been saying, 'Hey, where are your tax returns?' A lot of us wondered what he was hiding. Because you know, if it was something that would make him look good, he would put them right out there. Everybody who's ever run for president in at least the last 40 years has released their tax returns. My husband and I have about 40 years of tax returns out there. You can go and look at them and you can see that we paid a lot of taxes, and frankly, we were grateful we could. We are grateful for the blessings that we've had over the last 15 years."", ""So did any of you see the debate last Monday? Well, I raised it. I said, 'Well, maybe he doesn't want us to see that he owes hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign banks and foreign lenders, or maybe he hasn't paid any taxes.' Now, shortly after the debate, it was discovered that, indeed, back in the 1990s he apparently lost a billion dollars on bad investments and failing casinos. Ask yourself this: Who loses money on casinos? Really. And yesterday some of his supporters said, 'Well, it just shows he's a genius that he didn't pay any taxes.' Well, what kind of genius loses a billion dollars in the first place?"", ""In the debate, he said not paying taxes made him smart. But think about what that means. It means that all the rest of us who pay our taxes, right – what's he saying about us? But more than that, zero taxes means zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for Pell Grants to send young people to college, zero for health, zero for education. And you stop and ask yourself, this is the same person who's been going around really just dumping on America. He says our military's a disaster. Well, he could not be more wrong, but thank goodness the rest of us paid to support our men and women in uniform who have done so much for us."", ""Today in Colorado, he claimed he brilliantly used the laws to avoid paying taxes. Well, that just shows, number one, he is the poster boy – the poster boy – for the same rigged system that he would make even worse. Just think about it. He paid zero at least for about 20 years, we believe now based on what we know. And he's advocating for huge tax cuts that would help him and his family even more. What's he want us to do, pay him to lose money? Really?"", ""There's a lot more to this story, and we're just slowly getting it into the public eye. So we know he's stiffed people, didn't pay his bills. We know he took bankruptcy, depending on how you count, four or six times. You know that he paid no taxes for probably 20 years. We don't know what his taxes would be after that. He's always talked about how he can't release his taxes because he's under audit, but he admitted everything before 2009 is not under audit, so Donald, release everything up until 2009. Show the American people your taxes."", ""I'll tell you another thing. If I'm fortunate enough to be president, we're going to pass a law requiring anybody who is a nominee of a major national party to have to release their taxes."", 'So what did we find out today? Well, a story just came out saying that Donald Trump used Chinese steel and aluminum for two out of the last three construction projects. So instead of buying his steel and aluminum from American plants here in Ohio and Pennsylvania, instead of supporting hardworking families and American jobs, he once again stiffed us. He sent that money overseas.', 'Now, he spends a lot of time bashing the Chinese, right? You hear that all the time when he talks. Well, it turns out he bought his steel and aluminum from the Chinese. It turns out he owes big money to the Chinese. So this is another one of the episodes of his reality television show, where he is saying one thing and doing something else.', ""Now, for years, China has been undermining American businesses and workers by illegally dumping cheap aluminum and steel into our markets. You know that, right? And it sounds like Donald Trump has been buying that dumped steel and aluminum. How can he make America great again when he won't even buy American products in our country?"", ""And I'll tell you, this is personal to me, because as a senator I went before the International Trade Commission on behalf of steel workers in New York who I represented. And as Secretary of State, I went toe-to-toe with the Chinese. I have put forward an agenda to crack down on trade abuses from countries like China, to stand up for American workers, and to rebuild American infrastructure with American materials like steel and aluminum."", ""And today in Toledo I pointed out, because Chrysler just announced an expansion of the plant there for the new Jeep Wrangler – about 700 more jobs, right? I pointed out when the automobile industry was flat on its back and 850,000 workers in Ohio could have been absolutely out of a job – more than we can even imagine in terms of the long-lasting impact on the economy here – Donald Trump said he didn't care. Save it, don't save it; didn't matter to him."", ""Well, I'll tell you where I stood. I stood in favor of saving the American automobile industry. And look what we got. Last year, our auto industry had the best year they've had in a really long time. And so we've got to keep building it. We've got to keep making sure that there are good jobs. And we've got to protect good union jobs against the kind of assault that is coming from all sides."", ""So now, I know that Ohio is a tough, tough state. You've got to get out there. You've got to talk to people, answer questions, make your case. That's what we've been doing. That's what we're going to do all the way to the end of this election. But I need your help to talk to anybody you know here who thinks they might be voting for Trump. I know you know people. I know you do. And you've got to stage an intervention. You've got to sit them down and point out how everything he says he wants to do is absolutely opposite of what he has done, and how everything he has proposed will help people like him and his family but not the vast majority of families in Ohio. In fact, if you look at his tax proposals, they benefit him and other wealthy people – hedge fund managers and the like, and they would actually raise taxes on middle-class families."", ""Now, that's the kind of contrast we're getting out in the campaign, but that's why we need your help – to make sure you go out and talk to everybody. And I know people want change. That's part of the American dynamic spirit. We want change. Well, I'll tell you, one thing that is certain is we'll have change – it's just what kind of change. It's whether or not we have change that helps the vast majority of Americans, hardworking Americans, middle-class families, or continues to only help those at the top. I want an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. And that's exactly what we're going to fight for, and that is what we're going to get."", ""I'll tell you, I've been called a lot of things. Right? I've never been called quitter. If I tell you I'm going to get up every day and fight for you, that is exactly what I will do."", ""But I know I can't do it – I can't do it alone. Donald Trump stood on the stage of his convention and just once again painted this dark and dire picture of America. And then he said, 'I alone can fix it.' He gets confused between leadership and dictatorship. He has a hard time remembering who our friends are and who our adversaries are. He has a weird fascination with dictators like Vladimir Putin. We have a lot of people living in this part of Ohio who either themselves or their parents or grandparents came from countries that were under the yoke of oppression, and we're never going to let that happen again."", ""And so when Trump basically signs up for Putin's wish list, that's bad enough. But then, when he's cavalier – and I'm not talking about basketball – when he is cavalier about nuclear weapons, saying that, oh, he doesn't care if other countries get them; in fact, you know, if there were a nuclear war in East Asia, if Japan got nuclear weapons, if South Korea got nuclear weapons, hey, just go at it, folks. He even said he wouldn't care if Saudi Arabia got nuclear weapons. One thing that has been a bedrock of American foreign policy through Democratic and Republican presidents going back to the dawn of the atomic age is we were committed to trying to keep other countries from getting access to nuclear weapons, to be able to stop proliferation. And now it's even more important because it's not only states that we have to worry about, like North Korea; we've got to worry about terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons. The last thing we want to do is just act like it doesn't matter, because it does."", ""I was involved in putting together the sanctions against Iran that drove them to the negotiating table. And what I learned – if you use diplomacy and you're tough about it, you can actually get an agreement that put a lid on their nuclear program. And we're going to make sure they follow it to the period, the comma, everything in that agreement. I'm going to enforce. And we still have challenges with Iran, but I think we're in a stronger position given the fact that they are not racing for a nuclear weapon because we have intrusive inspections."", ""So I know diplomacy can work because I've done it, and I know that – we can defeat ISIS and the terrorists if we work with other nations, if we have a coalition that actually takes them out from the air, takes them out on the ground, and fights them online where they are doing so much damage by radicalizing and recruiting young people. I've been laying out my plan for what I think it will take to defeat ISIS, and I have no doubt we will. And Donald says he has a secret plan. That he won't tell us about. Well, there's no secret; he has no plan."", ""And we've got to do more – we've got to do more to make sure we protect our country. We need the best intelligence we can get, the best cooperation among law enforcement at all levels of government. I will not rest. As a former Senator from New York on 9/11, I take this as a personal responsibility. I will do everything I can to keep our country safe and to work with others to defeat the threat posed by terrorism."", ""And finally, my friends, we've got to bring our country back together. There is too much divisiveness, too much finger-pointing and scapegoating. Our diversity is one of our strengths. We have to listen to each other. We don't have to agree; that is not required. But we need to be respectful. We need to listen. And then we need to roll up our sleeves and get to work."", ""When I was First Lady, Senator, Secretary of State, I worked to find common ground with everybody. I worked when I was First Lady with Republicans and Democrats to create the Children's Health Insurance Program that insures eight million kids. When I was in the Senate, I worked with practically every Republican I served with. And they all have nice things to say about me when I'm not running for something. And I will work again to move our country forward and to change the [...] of that. And we had to get 13 Republicans, and I worked tirelessly and we got them. We did that. There is a lot we can do if we start listening and respecting each other and avoid the kind of name-calling and insults that we see too much of."", ""So I'm excited about the campaign, but I'm even more excited about getting to work for you – being able to get up every day and find a way to try to help somebody. I mean, that is how I was raised in my church and by my family, and that is what I have done through my advocacy work and my legal work on behalf of people who needed a voice. And I will do everything possible to make sure I deliver results for you. And the reason that I have published a book with my great running mate, Tim Kaine – it's right here – is real simple: I want you to know what we say we're going to do, because I want you to hold me accountable. I don't believe in bait and switch, where I say, oh, we're going to do something and then I really am over here doing something else. That kind of reminds you of somebody, doesn't it? No, here's what we're going to try to do. We're going to pay for it by raising taxes on the wealthy and closing loopholes on corporations. And I am the only candidate who ran this whole campaign saying I will never raise taxes on the middle class. That is not going to happen when I am president."", ""So please join this campaign in the last 36 days. Talk to your friends. Remember, friends don't let friends vote for Trump. I am motivated every day because now I'm a grandmother – two beautiful grandchildren – and I think about their future, I think about their lives, I think about our country. I want our country to be the land of opportunity. The place where dreams do come true if you're willing to work for them. Not just for my grandchildren, but for every child. I want every child in this country to have a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. And if you will help me win this election, and then help me work to make it come true, we will have a country that delivers on our dreams and a future we can all be proud of."", 'Thank you and God bless you!""']"
65,            Hillary Clinton          ,"October 03, 2016","['""Hello, Toledo. I am – I am very happy to be here today and – I am so grateful to have this chance to talk to you about what we can do together to have the kind of economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.', ""I want to acknowledge – we have an overflow crowd in another room, and I know they can hear us, but we're glad they're here. I want to thank your Congresswoman, Marcy Kaptur, for her leadership and her grit. I want to thank Mayor Paula Hicks-Hudson. And the mayor told me there's a young man here who just won a boxing championship, Robert Easter. Where's Robert Easter? There you are, Robert Easter. Congratulations. I know Toledo is proud of you; we all are. I want to thank Kenyetta for that introduction. Do we have any other UAW members here?"", ""It's a great day to be here in Ohio for a lot of different reasons. One is I am so thrilled that LeBron James has endorsed me and joined our campaign. I know – I've gotten a lot of wonderful endorsements over the past year and a half. I'm grateful for each and every one of them. But I got to say, there's something special about this one. And it's a real honor in part because of why he chose to endorse me. Now, not everyone knows this. I mean, you all know what an amazing athlete he his – MVP, winner of championships – but he's also – LeBron is also a dedicated advocate for children. And this afternoon I'll be in Akron, where he's done so much for the kids in that community."", ""It's a deep, personal commitment that he has that I share with him. We both believe every single child should have the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. I could not be prouder to have LeBron joining our team as we head into the homestretch."", ""Now, one thing I know – I'll just say it because I know it's for sure – I hope to be elected president, but I know here in Ohio LeBron will always be the King."", 'I was listening to Kenyetta introduce me, and I really appreciated what she said, because Toledo is the kind of place where people work hard, look after one another, and yes, pay their taxes, right?', 'You recognize that we all have to do our part because we are all in this together, and it matters.', 'We believe honest work deserves honest pay. We believe everyone should have the right to join a strong union that will always have your back.', ""It's personal for me. I'm the granddaughter of a factory worker from Scranton, Pennsylvania. He went to work in the same lace mill every day for 50 years. He believed he passed it down to my dad, who passed it down to me that if he did what he was supposed to do, he'd have a good life and his kids would have an even better life. That is the American dream. That is what we believe in. That's what we've got to keep going generation after generation."", ""And because of my grandfather's hard work, my dad made it to college. And then after serving in the Navy during World War II, he started his own small business, printing fabric for draperies."", ""As a young girl, I'd sometimes go to his print plant. It was a long building, no natural light, no windows, but he had these long tables where he'd roll out the fabric and then I'd watch him work with silkscreens, if you've ever seen that. He would take the silkscreen, he'd put it down, he'd pour the paint in, he'd take the squeegee, go across all the way down to the end of one table, then over to the next table, all the way back. And then if there was a second color to be added, he would do that. He sometimes let me help with the squeegee. That was my favorite part."", 'And I know he worked really hard. He worked really hard. He believed in hard work. He passed that on to me. He provided a good middle-class life for us. So I am proud to stand with hardworking families all over Toledo, Ohio, and America, who should have the same chance that I did to share in the American Dream, which should be big enough for everybody.', ""Fighting for kids and families has been the cause of my life, as Kenyetta said, when I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund all those years ago. And it will be the mission of my presidency, because I want to focus on what are called kitchen table issues, the ones that keep you up at night – like the cost of child care, and college, and prescription drugs, and so much else."", ""And that means we've got to create more good jobs with rising incomes. That means we've got to have good schools in every zip code. That means everybody willing to work – and I say that very clearly; you've got to be willing to work – and if you're willing to work, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead. That is the basic bargain."", ""Now, I don't know about you, but you wouldn't think that the theme of my campaign, 'getting an economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top' would be controversial – and yet this is one of the defining debates not just of this election but of our time."", 'Now, I will say, most American companies – most – are run by honorable, patriotic people who care about their employees and communities. But there are still too many powerful interests fighting to protect their own profits and privileges at the expense of everyone else. [Applause.] And they are aided and abetted by the rules and incentives in our economy who actually encourage people at the top to take advantage of consumers, workers, small businesses, and taxpayers.', ""That makes it tougher for the well-meaning CEOs to take the high road. And it gets even harder when we don't aggressively enforce the rules, when we don't enforce trade rules that allow other countries with lower wages and standards to get an unfair leg up, when we don't enforce rules on Wall Street, which exerts enormous pressure on publicly traded companies to prioritize boosting share prices in the short term over building real value, investing in workers, plant, and equipment over the longer term."", ""And let's be honest, the tax code rewards corporations for outsourcing jobs and their profits overseas instead of investing here in the United States. And it is riddled with loopholes that let the rich get even richer and make income inequality even worse. It tilts the playing field further against small businesses that can't afford lawyers and lobbyists."", ""So with all these pressures pushing in the wrong direction, it's even more important that we have an election about these very issues. Because what I know will happen – if we have an election where we have an agenda that actually would begin to level that playing field, we will rebuild the middle class, we will make work pay, we will create greater opportunities for a great percentage of Americans."", 'Now, I know how hard this, but I think we are on the cusp, if we win this election, to be able to get these things done, right?""', 'Audience: ""Yeah.""', 'Clinton: ""That means pursuing reforms that unleash the enormous positive potential of the American private sector. We\'ve got unmatched talent, innovation, entrepreneurial spirit.', 'So when we work together, we can all benefit.', ""Now, I believe corporations that benefit from everything America has to offer should feel some sense of responsibility not just to their biggest shareholders – but to their workers, to their customers, to their communities, and yes, to our country, to the United States of America.

But it is time to get back on track."", ""And you can ask anybody who's ever worked for me or worked with me, who's ever served with me, when I tell you I'm going to try to do something, I will get up every single day and work my heart out for you."", ""So let's begin by making it clear that for most businesses, America is the most important asset on their balance sheet. This country of ours, this system of ours, the rule of law, the opportunity to get an education and go as far as your hard work and ambition will take you. And we created the biggest engine of economic growth in the world, the American middle class. So when we middle class thrives, the country thrives. And when it doesn't, we don't, right?"", ""And I'm going to use the White House and every tool at my disposal as your president to make the case that patriotism is profitable. Standing up for America, investing in America will pay off."", 'Now, we have always had innovators and entrepreneurs who build great companies and create real value. But we should not and we will not respect those who get rich by cheating everybody else.', 'So today I want to send a clear message to every boardroom, every executive suite across America: If you scam your customers, exploit your employees, pollute our environment, or rip off taxpayers, we will find ways to hold you accountable.', ""But on the other side – on the other side, if you do the right thing and you invest in your workers and your communities and our country's future, we will stand with you. That is the choice. Our goal is to make it easier for everyone to do better."", ""Now, to understand why this is so important, consider the recent examples we've seen of egregious corporate behavior."", ""Look at Wells Fargo. Really shocking, isn't it? One of the nation's biggest banks bullying thousands of employees into committing fraud against unsuspecting customers, secretly opening up millions of accounts for people without their consent, even their knowledge, misusing personal information, and then sticking customers with hidden fees. It is outrageous that eight years after a cowboy culture on Wall Street wrecked our economy, we are still seeing powerful bankers playing fast and loose with the law."", ""And then in a category by himself, there's Donald Trump. Well, you may have heard that he has long refused to release his tax returns the way every other nominee for president has done for decades. You can look at 40 years of my tax returns. I think we need a law that says if you become the nominee of the major parties, you have to release your tax returns."", ""Now, a lot of us were wondering, what is he hiding? It must be really terrible. Well, The New York Times has discovered at least part of the answer. Back in the 1990s, Trump apparently lost a billion dollars in a single year on bad investments and failing casinos. Now, how anybody can lose a dollar, let alone a billion dollars, in the casino industry is kind of beyond me. It's just hard to figure. But as a result, it doesn't look like he paid a dime of federal income tax for almost two decades."", ""Now, while millions of American families, including mine and yours, were working hard paying our fair share, it seems he was contributing nothing to our nation. Imagine that. Not fair. Nothing for Pell Grants to help kids go to college. Nothing for veterans. Nothing for our military. And you know, he has been dissing America in this whole campaign. Right? He talks us down. He makes disparaging comments about our country. He calls our military a disaster. Well, it's not, but it might have been if everybody else had failed to pay taxes to support our brave men and women in uniform."", ""I saw a newspaper article. A gentleman named Steve Crouse, who owns the Glass City Café here in Toledo, summed it up pretty well in this article. He said, 'I would feel guilty if I didn't pay anything. It's flat-out cheating the government.' Now, my friend Bernie Sanders was right yesterday when he said Trump reflects a distorted view of the American people and what this country is all about."", ""Trump represents the same rigged system that he claims he's going to change. The whole story tells us everything we need to know about how Trump does business. After he made all those bad bets and lost all that money, he didn't lift a finger to help and protect his employees, or all the small businesses and contractors he'd hired, or the people of Atlantic City. They all got hammered while he was busy with his accountants trying to figure out how he could keep living like a billionaire. And all the while he was using his political connections to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in government subsidies and extra tax breaks for his companies. In other words, Trump was taking from America with both hands and leaving the rest of us with the bill."", ""Now, he says that he's the one who can fix things, but that is like letting the fox guard the henhouse. Right? And here's what I really am just stunned by. I get stunned every day in this campaign. But here's one of the many things that I'm stunned by. He has put forth a tax plan that would cut his own taxes even more. It would be like you're paying zero. You expect us to pay you to stay in business, all the rest of us in America? He'd open the loopholes even wider. And according to a new independent study, he would actually – listen to this, people, because this is a real shocker – his plan would actually raise taxes for millions of middle class families. And you know the people it would hit the hardest? Are single parents, whose lives and challenges he doesn't care about, certainly doesn't understand."", ""Now, many have likely already spent years paying more than he did, and he now would make that even worse. And what does he say about it? Well, did you all see the debate last Monday? Well, in the debate – in the debate – well, then you all know that in the debate he said it was smart to avoid paying taxes. Yesterday his campaign was bragging it makes him a genius. Here's my question: What kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year?"", ""This is Trump to a T. He's taken corporate excess and makes a business model out of it. He abuses his power, games the system, puts his own interests ahead of the country's. It's Trump first and everyone else last. And there are lots of principled, law-abiding business leaders out there who are horrified by all of this. Not a single – not a single CEO of a Fortune 100 company supports Trump's campaign. Think about it. I've been endorsed by very successful people – Warren Buffett, Mike Bloomberg, Mark Cuban. I loved what Mark Cuban said when he endorsed me. He said, 'Look, I've been successful.' He actually is a real billionaire. And you know what? He used profit-sharing to help his employees, not bankruptcy to fire people. And when he sold his first company, he shared the profits with his employees, and 300 of them became millionaires. That's the kind of business practices I want to see more of in our country."", ""But here's what we've got to do. Even if Trump is like one of a kind, we've got to reverse the broader trends he represents. It's time to rewrite the rules and make this economy fair for everyone. And today I want to briefly share with you my plan for protecting taxpayers, consumers, small businesses, and workers. We're going to crack down on the worst corporate abuses and empower companies willing to take the high road and invest in good jobs, in higher wages, and in stronger communities."", ""First let's start with protecting taxpayers and making sure we have more fairness in the system. It is wrong that corporations and the super-wealthy play by a different set of rules. A Wall Street money manager should not be able to pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a nurse. And I'll tell you something else. Our largest companies should not be able to get away with paying hardly anything at all. It is insulting when they engage in these games, like moving their headquarters over to a foreign country – on paper, not in reality – just to take advantage of lower tax rates. And it is infuriating when they take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips in America with the other hand."", ""So here's what we're going to do. We're going to close those loopholes. I've got a list of them we're going after. We're going to make Wall Street corporations and the super-rich start paying their fair share of taxes. We're going to pass something called the Buffett rule, which means multimillionaires cannot lower rates than their secretaries and other people working for them. We're going to put in place a new exit tax. If companies try to leave our country to avoid paying their fair share, if they try to outsource jobs, they're going to have to give back every tax break they ever received in our country. And then we're going to put that money to work creating opportunities here in America."", ""Second, we're going to protect consumers. No American should ever be taken advantage of, like thousands were, by Wells Fargo. And this isn't a new fight for me. As a Senator, I raised the alarm about subprime mortgages. I fought to hold reckless managers accountable for toxic toys and household products that threaten our kids. I introduced legislation to protect Americans' personal data and combat identity theft. So as president, I will make consumer protection a top priority across the entire government."", ""And that starts by defending and empowering the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-reau, which was created after the financial crisis. And the principal person who got it created was Senator Elizabeth Warren. And under the leadership of Ohio's Rich Cordray, the agency has already returned more than $11 billion to more than 15 million Americans who were ripped off by predatory lenders, credit card companies, and others. And it is the one making sure that the defrauded Wells Fargo customers get their money back."", ""Now, I got to say I am so proud of what this new agency has done. Sometimes people say, well, what does the government really do? Well, there's a lot of examples, but this is a primary one, standing up and making sure consumers get paid back when they are ripped off. And because of its success, Republicans in Congress keep trying to shut it down. And Donald Trump agrees with them. In fact, he wants to scrap all the tough new rules imposed on Wall Street after the crisis. Well, not on my watch, Donald. We're never going to let that happen."", 'Now, instead of gutting consumer protection, we should be expanding it. And we should build on the Dodd-Frank financial reforms and go even further because Wall Street can never, ever be permitted to threaten Main Street again. And the Wells Fargo scandal sheds light on another threat to consumers that we have to address. When the scam\'s victims, people like you and me, who had accounts there tried to sue, they were shocked to learn there was a provision in the very fine print of their contracts that kept them from going to court to sue the bank for being cheated. Instead, they are forced into a closed-door arbitration process without the important protections that you get in a court of law. We are not going to let corporations like Wells Fargo use these fine print ""gotchas"" to escape accountability.', ""And in fact, this is now common practice across a lot of industries – from nursing homes, nursing homes that mistreat seniors, to for-profit colleges that defraud students. Who reads all that fine print? I don't. And you get defrauded or you get mistreated, and then all of a sudden they say, 'Well, you can't sue us.' So we're going to rein in that abuse across everybody."", ""We also see a similar problem in some international trade agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It sets up a dispute resolution system that favors large corporations over everyone else. It's one of the reasons I'm against it. I've warned about this for years, I've written about it, and I oppose TPP now, I will oppose it after the election, I will oppose it as president – because it is one-sided and unfair to American workers."", ""And what about all those pharmaceutical companies that jack up prices for no reason? We're going to have to protect ourselves against that too. And when we find unjustified spikes in the prices of longstanding, life-saving drugs, we should slap penalties on companies trying to cheat people who need those drugs."", ""And let's finally import safe alternatives from other countries, like Canada, and speed up approvals to get more generic drugs on the market. And it is long past time to allow Medicare to negotiate for better prices for drugs and get the cost down for Medicare recipients. And I believe we should cap the amount working families pay out of pocket every month for medicine. No one should ever have to choose between paying the rent and filling their prescriptions."", ""So let's stand up for taxpayers. Let's stand up for consumers. And let's stand up for small businesses, which create most of the jobs in America. I take this personally be-cause of my dad's very small business. We need fair rules of the road so big corporations can't use their power to gain unfair advantages."", ""Now, when it comes to bullying small businesses, Donald Trump is the poster boy. I have heard so many stories of contractors, and I've met some too, who worked for him, produced the goods and services, and never got paid for what they were owed. I'm talking about painters, and plumbers, piano sellers, architects, glass installers – he stiffed them all. Not because he couldn't pay them, but he wouldn't pay them. And he told them, 'You want to get your money? Sue me.' My dad could never have done that. I'm just grateful my dad never got a contract with Donald Trump, because I don't know what we would have done."", ""More than 60 percent of small businesses face payment delays. That can cause a serious cash flow crisis. So as president, I will explore new ways to arm small businesses with the tools to fight back and level the playing field. Part of the problem is large corporations are amassing so much power in our economy. Sometimes it's called market concentration or even old-fashioned monopolies, but either way it threatens businesses of all sizes, as well as consumers. With less competition, corporations can use their power to raise prices, limit choice for consumers, cut wages for workers, crowd out startups and small businesses."", ""I mean, look what's happening right now. In most of the country, the three largest health insurance companies in each state control 80 percent of the market. No wonder premiums are going up. As president, I will appoint tough, independent authorities to strengthen anti-trust enforcement and really scrutinize mergers and acquisitions, so the big don't keep getting bigger and bigger."", ""I want every business to compete and thrive, and then I also want to do something else. Let's protect and empower workers who actually drive our economy. Everyone who works hard should be able to share in the rewards, not just senior executives. So we're proposing new tax credits to encourage more companies to share profits, on top of, not instead of, higher wages."", ""We need to support new organizing strategies for employees who too often have never had the benefit of collective bargaining. And we have to resist the assault on workers' rights. Let's say loudly and clearly: 'right to work' is wrong for workers and wrong for America."", ""Let's also, my friends, let's raise the minimum wage and support the Fight for 15 so you don't live in poverty. Let's defend overtime and go after wage theft. Let's provide family leave that is paid and access to affordable, high-quality childcare. And of course you know what I'm going to say: let's finally guarantee equal pay for women."", ""Now, my opponent and his chief surrogates like to say I'm playing the woman's card. And I'll tell you – right? – if fighting for working families is playing the women's card, you know what? Deal me in!"", ""And then finally, I've got a lot on my mind, but finally, we need to make it easier for companies to invest in good jobs here at home. As president, I will ramp up enforcement of trade rules by appointing a new chief trade prosecutor and tripling the number of enforcement officers. We will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. I want to direct $10 billion to create a 'Make It in America' partnership to support American manufacturing. And I want to take some of the ideas that worked when my husband was President and we ended up with 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody."", ""That includes incentives like the New Markets Tax Credit for creating good jobs in poor or remote areas, from inner cities to rural communities ravaged – ravaged – by hollowed-out factories, ravaged by mines that have been shut down, ravaged by opiate addiction. It all comes down to this: When I say our economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top, I mean it. And we're going to do everything we can to make sure workers are treated like assets, not costs. And we're going to bring back infrastructure jobs, advanced manufacturing jobs, clean, renewable energy jobs, innovation, technology, small business."", ""Now, you don't have to look any further than right here in Northwest Ohio. Just a few years ago, as you heard Kenyetta say, in 2009 you were in the eye of the storm. Jobs, homes, savings, wiped out. The auto industry on the verge of collapse. A lot of people were ready to give up on it. Well, that would have meant giving up on 850,000 people across this state whose jobs were tied to the industry. Donald Trump, for one, said rescuing the auto industry didn't matter very much. Either way would have been acceptable, he said. 'We could have just let it go,' and that's a direct quote from him. Everybody in Ohio who's thinking about voting for Trump needs to hear that. At the time of the worst financial crisis in Ohio in 2009, he would have let you twist and fall. And for his running mate he picked Mike Pence, an ardent opponent of the auto rescue. Well, thank goodness the people of Northwest Ohio weren't ready to let it go. You never gave up. You didn't lose faith. And now, after a lot of hard work and sacrifice, the auto industry just had its best year ever."", ""But that's not all there is to the story because in addition to that hard work, America, America, came to the rescue. Taxpayers like all of us, not him but us, provided the funds for the rescue. Union workers stepped up. Communities like Toledo came together to make it work. And now that the industry's back on its feet, the auto companies have a responsibility to give back."", ""So I was delighted to hear that Chrysler is doubling down on Toledo, investing $700 million here to start building the next generation Jeep Wrangler, which could create about 700 new good jobs. And tens of thousands of UAW workers at Chrysler plants should see a big increase in profit-sharing payments above and beyond wages and benefits. Now, that's the way it's supposed to work, when we all help each other out. When we stand together, we are stronger together."", ""So what I want you to know is if you join me in this campaign, I will always stand up and fight for you and fight for your jobs and fight for your families. And I guess we have about 36 days left. The election's going to be close. Every call you make, every door you knock, every friend you register to vote, could make the difference. You can text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246 right now or go to hillaryclinton.com to sign up and volunteer. Here in Ohio you have until October the 11th to register to vote. And there are people with clipboards around, and you can go actually register today on your way out the door."", 'So we have just over a week to register, and then early voting starts October 12th. Let\'s prove – let\'s prove – that the American dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise. Let\'s prove that we\'re going to stand together, make the smart decisions that we get the economy going and growing for everybody, not just those at the top; that we will stand up against special privilege and special interest; that we will be ready after this election to have an agenda that will really make a difference here in Toledo and across Ohio. So I\'m here asking for your help, asking for your work, asking for you to be part of this campaign, and then when we win on November 8, be part of changing our country for the better! Thank you all and God bless you!""']"

And I want to thank Tony for his introduction. He made the greatest case against my opponent, didn\'t he? Thank you, Tony. And thanks to Mayor Ginther and Congresswoman Beatty and to my great friend, your former governor, and with your help, the next senator, Ted Strickland.', ""Any of you see that debate last night? I'll tell you what, I'm not sure you'll ever see anything like that again. At least I hope you won't. It was such a clear display of what's at stake in this election. And I am thrilled to have the chance to talk with all of you about what we can do together, because I truly believe we are stronger together. To move our country forward."", ""Now, the one thing I thought about last night and said was, as I was standing there on the stage with my opponent, was to remember what Michelle Obama had said. To paraphrase her, one of us went low and one of us went high. I want you to understand, I want to be a president for all Americans. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody. And I am honored to have support, not just from Democrats, but from independents and Republicans, because we've got to pull this country together if we're going to move into the future together, creating what we need for ourselves and our children."", ""Now, I got to tell you, tomorrow is a big day in Ohio for this election because tomorrow, October 11th, is the last day to register in Ohio. And I hope every one of you will take your phones out, go to iwillvote.com, to confirm that you are registered. Because we want everybody to vote and we particularly want young people to vote because this is your election more than anybody else's."", ""When I think about the challenges that we're facing, I don't think any one person has all the answers. I think we have to listen to each other and respect each other and celebrate our diversity, because that makes us smarter as well as stronger."", ""Donald Trump spent his time last night attacking me when he should have been apologizing. We all heard on that tape what he thinks of women and how he treats women. And last night he doubled down on his excuse, saying that, well, it's just locker room banter. You know what's happened today, which is so interesting, is that a lot of athletes and coaches from the NBA, from Major League Baseball, from the NFL and more, have been coming forward, tweeting, they've been saying, no, that's not what happens in our locker rooms. And I just happen to think that our athletes and our coaches know a lot more about what happens in locker rooms than Donald Trump does."", ""But it wasn't just this one video that was so disturbing, even shocking. We have seen this kind of behavior throughout this entire campaign, and it's not just about women. Yes, he's insulted and demeaned women; we've seen it over and over again. But he has targeted others as well. He's disrespected and denigrated African Americans and Latinos, Muslims and POWs, people with disabilities and immigrants. He is an equal-opportunity insulter if there ever was one."", ""That is not what we are in America. And it may be who he is, but this election is our chance to show who we are. We are better than that. We are bigger than that. And I want to send a message to every boy and girl, every man and woman in our country, indeed, to the entire world, that that is not who America is. And we can do that by making sure that we turn out in the biggest numbers ever. Some analysts are saying we may have the biggest presidential election than we've had in a really long time. And the main reason is because your generation, the young people of America, are the most tolerant, open and generous generation in American history."", ""You know what's at stake, but you also know what you believe. And you don't want someone who says that he's going to appoint Supreme Court justices who will reverse marriage equality; who will – who will keep Citizens United, one of the worst decisions ever made, that allowed dark, unaccountable money in our electoral system; that will reverse a woman's right to make her own health care decisions; who will defund Planned Parenthood. You know better than that. You are helping us move toward a more perfect union. That has been the story of America at our best. We keep widening the circle of opportunity and inviting more people in. If you're willing to do your part, you're willing to make your contribution, there is a place for you in this nation of ours."", ""We don't have to make America great. We've got to do what we can to make sure it remains great and it becomes greater because we keep broadening that circle of opportunity."", ""And please, never forget America is great because America is good, and if we deviate, if we deviate from our fundamental values – and that's indeed the kind of campaign my opponent has run. He has said he would order our men and women in uniform to commit war crimes. He has said he would impose a religious test on who could come into our country – a nation founded on religious freedom and liberty. This is turning the clock back, not just a few years, but centuries. The only way to rebuke this is to vote. Use the single most important, fundamental right you have as citizens of America."", ""And when you do, I want you to know what you're voting for, because I don't want you just to vote against something. I want you to vote for something. And here's what we're going to do."", ""I believe our economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top. So I am ending this campaign the way I started my career all those years ago when I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund. As soon as I got out of law school, I said, I don't want to do anything else other than work hard and advocate for kids and families. So I was fortunate to have the chance to be really on the front lines of a lot of change, helping to get the law that enabled people, kids with disabilities, to go to school. Now, most of you may not have any reason to remember this because you weren't born, but – there was a time in our country not so long ago when if you had a disability, if you lived in a school district, there was no requirement that they make accommodations for you. And literally millions of kids were denied an education. I went door to door getting information about what was going on with these children so that I could contribute a report to a big national effort to go to the Congress and say, this is wrong – in America, we're better than this. Open the doors of our schools to kids with disabilities."", 'And then I was privileged to work to make sure that we got young people out of adult jails and prisons where they had no reason to be in the first place.', ""So when Donald Trump talks about what I've been doing for the last 30 years, I welcome that. I welcome it because in the 1970s, I was working to end discrimination and he was being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination against people in his apartments. And in the 1980s, I was working to improve the schools in Arkansas to make sure that teachers were well paid and that the coursework was going to prepare kids for the future, while he was getting a loan for $14 million from his father to start a business. And in the 1990s, I went to the UN Conference on Women and said women's rights are human rights – while he was insulting Miss Universe, Alicia Machado. And on the day – on the day that I was in the Situation Room watching the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting Celebrity Apprentice. So if he wants to talk about what we have been doing the last 30 years, bring it on."", ""So we've got to make up our minds about what kind of economy we want. And I'm pretty clear about that. I think we want new jobs with rising incomes. And I want us to have the biggest new jobs effort since the end of World War II. And I have some specific ideas in mind. We are going to have a big investment in infrastructure: our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems. They need to be upgraded and maintained and built. That is a question of competitiveness. We have to have a competitive economy. Our airports are so rundown we don't even have one airport in our entire country in the top 25 in the world because we're not using the newest technology. We're not really prepared to do what we need to to invest in you and invest in those new jobs."", ""I do want to bring advanced manufacturing. I heard Ted Strickland talking about that. I think we can have a manufacturing renaissance. There is no reason that we cannot own new manufacturing. I'm not interested in a race to the bottom, in competing for low-wage jobs. I am interested in competing for the high-wage jobs. So let's lead in precision machining, 3D printing."", ""And let's be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. Some nation's going to have that title. I think it's either going to be Germany or China or us. It should be us. No question it should be. We're going to fight climate change. And we're going to lead the world in fulfilling the requirements of the Paris agreement."", ""I'm running against somebody who doesn't believe in climate change or at least he says he doesn't , who has even said he thinks it's a hoax created by the Chinese. Well, right now the Chinese have twice as much renewable energy as we do. So maybe they think it's a hoax, but they're investing. And they're creating. And they're going to want to export. And what a shame it would be. We have innovated. We have made the technology that could bring us into the forefront of this. And we're going to do it."", ""When I am president, I want all of you who care about science, technology, engineering, mathematics, I want you to be part of it. And while we are growing the economy, we are going to make it fairer. We are going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works full-time should be left in poverty. And don't you think it is finally time to guarantee equal pay for women's work?"", ""You know, back in the spring, I was at a town hall in Las Vegas. And the little girl raised her hand. And I called on her. And she said to me, 'If you're elected president, does a girl president make the same as a boy president?'"", 'I said, ""Well, that\'s one of those jobs where they have to publish what you make."" So we\'re going to have more transparency so people have more incentive to make sure that everybody is treated fairly.', ""And I'll tell you something else. I want to do more to promote profit-sharing. If you help to make the profits, it shouldn't all just go to the executives and the shareholders. You should be able to share in that."", ""Now, there's a lot we can do. And people say, 'Well, how are you going to pay for it?' Well, I'm going to go where the money is. And all the money is going to the wealthiest in our country. I have made a pledge, and you can hold me to it. I will not raise taxes on the middle class. Nobody who is working hard to get ahead should be asked to pay more in taxes when we have so many people who have done so well and are not paying their fair share."", ""Now, Donald Trump is the poster child for this. Last night he finally admitted he hasn't paid a dime in federal income tax for years. Now, he claims that's because back in the early 1990s, he apparently lost a billion dollars running casinos. Who loses money running casinos? Really. Now, one of his supporters said, 'Well, the fact that he lost a billion dollars and that meant he didn't have to pay taxes made him a genius.' Well, I guess you do have to be a genius to lose a billion dollars in a year. But I'll tell you what. What that meant was he paid zero, zero for the military, zero for our vets, zero for Pell Grants to help a lot of you afford college and get through college."", ""And then he did something that, in retrospect, seemed both odd and not very smart. He brought in Warren Buffett. He said, 'Well, everybody does this. Warren Buffett does this.'"", ""So Warren Buffett, who, by the way, is a real billionaire, Warren Buffett, heard that, pretty hard to miss. And so he put out a statement today. And here's what he said. He said, 'I have paid federal income tax every year since 1944, when I was 13.' He said, 'I have copies of all 72 of my returns. And none uses a carryforward.' That was the gimmick Trump used to avoid paying his fair share. And then Warren Buffett ends by saying, 'Finally, I have been audited by the IRS multiple times and am currently being audited. I have no problem releasing my tax information while under audit.' 'Neither would Mr. Trump. At least he would have no legal problem in doing so.' Well, if you take a shot at Warren Buffett, you'd better be prepared."", ""And in fact, Warren Buffett actually agrees with me that wealthy people ought to pay more. He says no person in his fortunate position in life should be paying a lower tax rate than people who work for him. And he has proposed what's called the Buffett rule, and I am absolutely behind that, and I've said that's one of the changes I want – so that the wealthy have to pay their fair share."", ""Now, there was a lot about last night that was hard to believe. And so, don't. But one of the things that really struck me was he had not answer. You know, he's not usually tongue-tied, but he had no answer when confronted about the report that he's been buying cheap Chinese steel for his construction projects instead of American-made steel that supports good American jobs. Now, I know you've seen reports and you've probably seen a lot of the visuals coming out of his rallies. He's had a lot of them across Ohio. He claims to be on the side of workers. He especially likes to talk about how he supports American steelworkers. He even had the nerve – this is what kills me about him – he even had the nerve to brag about how American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring. And the whole time he was hiding the truth. Hiding the fact that he chose to buy illegally-dumped Chinese steel instead of American steel."", ""You know, when China illegally floods our market with steel at below-price, and people like Trump buy it, that kills jobs. It kills jobs in this state, including right here in Columbus. This May, Columbus Castings, the biggest single-site foundry in America, just seven miles from where we are tonight, filed for bankruptcy and announced that 800 workers would be laid off. Now, when I think of that and I think of the way Trump has been playing people, it really – it really gets me upset. There's no justification for it. But it fits him to a T. For all his talk about putting America first, he's made his products in at least 12 other countries. Trump's suits and ties were made in Mexico and China. They could have been made right here in Ohio. In fact, he could have made his ties three miles from the Trump Tower in New York."", ""So we've got to figure out how we have an economy that really does produce growth and rewards companies that do the right thing. And that for me means we need to have a tax system that rewards investment in our country, investment in workers, investment in plant and equipment, investment in research and development, and give the good guys a chance to get ahead instead of being taken advantage of by Wall Street and others."", ""We are going to end the cowboy culture on Wall Street and what happens in too many boardrooms. We're going to defend the tough new rules on Wall Street that President Obama got passed, the Dodd-Frank rules. Trump wants to do away with those. He also wants to do away with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, something that was designed and created by my friend Senator Elizabeth Warren to protect consumers. He wants to do away with that. And yet he claims to be on the side of working people and the middle class."", ""Well, we're going to crack down on corporate fraud, like we've seen at Wells Fargo. We're going to crack down to make sure that Wall Street can never wreck Main Street again. And we're going to do it in part by imposing some penalties on companies that try to pick up and leave America. If they try to leave, we're going to slap an exit tax on them and make them pay back every single penny they ever got in tax benefits from anybody in America."", ""We're also going to end the carried interest loophole. I've been trying to get that done for years. We're going to get it done. We've got a couple of different ways of doing it. I hope that Congress along with us, but if they don't, we're going to figure out a way to finally put an end to what is one of the most unfair parts of the whole tax code, hedge fund managers and others paying a lower tax rate, not for investing but just for moving money around. That's going to end. I want to reward the productive economy. I don't want to keep rewarding the financial economy. That is not the way we're going to grow new businesses, and create new opportunities and more jobs for Americans."", ""Now, people in Ohio often ask about, 'Well, what are we going to do about trade?' Well, we're going to have smart and fair trade. That's what I love about your Senator, Sherrod Brown. He is one of the best advocates for the kind of trade deals we should have. Look. We've got to trade with the rest of the world. We're only 5 percent of the population of the world. We've got to trade with the other 95 percent. When I was Secretary of State, we really bore down on this, and we increased American exports 30 percent, and in particular, 50 percent to China, because we stood behind every American business. We helped them knock down every barrier so that they could get into those markets and sell."", ""And I've gone toe-to-toe with the Chinese over trade. They have tried to slap unfair tariffs and prevent American companies from doing business without having to pay some kind of big fine or make some big deal. So we're going to stand up. I'm going to have a trade prosecutor who will report directly to me to make sure every trade deal we're already in is absolutely followed to the letter so nobody takes advantage of us."", ""And I've always had three tests for trade deals: Does it create American jobs? Does it raise American incomes? is it good for our national security? And when it comes to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the TPP, it fails my tests. Once it was finally negotiated, I don't think it will do what I want it to do, so I oppose it. I oppose TPP now. I'll oppose it after the election. I'll oppose it as president. But I'm going to keep fighting to open markets so that we can get more jobs and rising incomes by exporting into those markets and doing business with the rest of the world."", ""I also saw a sign or a t-shirt out here about Social Security. And that may not always be something that people on a great university campus think about, but I'll tell you what. I am never going to let anybody privatize Social Security. That is off the table forever."", ""So let's say yes to good jobs, but here's what else we need to say yes to. Let's say yes to good education from preschool all the way through college and university. I want every kid to be able to attend this great university to do well. And for a lot of kids, they're not prepared when they get to kindergarten and first grade. There's an achievement gap already. There's also a digital gap; we have five million homes, mostly poor homes, without access to the internet, so they're behind. I want this to be a true meritocracy. I'm tired of inequality. I want people to feel like they can get ahead if they work for it."", 'So I want to have universal pre-kindergarten so every child can be prepared to be successful. I want good schools and good teachers in every zip code so every child has the best possible public education. And I think we made a mistake when we took what used to be called vocational education out of high school. We need technical education for more young people. Not everybody needs to or wants to go to a four-year college, but everybody should have the opportunity to get the skills that he or she needs to get ahead and be successful. I want us to have our community colleges working with our high schools and our businesses. We have a lot of job openings for machinists and tool and die markers, for coders, for all kinds of skills.', ""And then when it comes to college, I want everybody who goes to a public college or university to understand what I am proposing that is a joint proposal from Senator Sanders and myself. We both remember that college was affordable. And it isn't for a lot of people now, and a lot of states have disinvested in their great public colleges and universities. So here is our proposal."", ""We want anyone from a family that makes less than $125,000 a year to go to Ohio State University tuition-free. And for families over that line, we want you to go debt-free. So yes, you pay what you can afford, but you don't have to go into debt to go to Ohio State. And I'll tell you, the other big problem – how many of you already have student debt? Oh, wow. Practically every hand. Well, here's what we're going to do. We're going to make it possible for you to refinance that debt. If you can refinance your home mortgage, your car payment, or if Donald can refinance his airplane, you ought to be able to refinance your student debt."", ""And then we want you to pay it back as a percentage of the income you make, and have a limit on that, 10 percent, so that – I feel personally about this because that's what I did after law school. My dad was a small businessman, and he really was a saver. He didn't even have a credit card. Didn't believe in that. So he saved the money for me to go to college. I had to work if I wanted to buy a book, but that was okay. That was the arrangement. And then I told him I wanted to go to law school. He said, 'You're on your own. I don't have any money for that.' So I worked, I got a small scholarship, and I took out loans. But boy, was I lucky, because I got into one of the earliest income repayment programs. In other words, when I got out of law school, I could go to work for the Children's Defense Fund and make, I don't know, $14,000 a year because I could pay it back as a percentage of my income, not on an interest rate of 8, 10, 12 percent like I see from young people across America."", ""So that's what I want, but I also want to make it possible, if you do public service or national service, to have a lot of your loan, and maybe all of it, forgiven because you're going to be paying back to our country. And I've got this idea about something I'm calling the National Service Reserve. It's kind of like if any of you have ever been in the military reserve. You get the training and you're kind of on call and you practice and train. And then if you're needed, you're called up. I want a civilian national reserve, and I want people of all ages in it. And we would train you so that if there's a natural disaster or some other problem that has to be dealt with, we could call you up to go do that. And it's a way of making sure that people are giving back all the time to this country because that's how we build solidarity. That's how we get to know each other better."", ""So I'm pretty excited about what we're going to do together. And I can't do any of this without your help. I really am asking you to do everything you can to make sure you're registered, to tell your friends and anybody else you can talk to make sure they're registered. As I said, go to iwillvote.com. You can find it out right there on that site.

So please, if you're not registered, get registered by tomorrow, and then you can start voting October 12th. And whatever issue, whatever issue you care about, imagine that that is on the ballot. Imagine if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage, if you believe – if you believe that we finally should have paid family leave in this country like every other advanced economy, if you believe climate change is real and we could save our planet by creating a lot of jobs at the same time, if you believe diversity is America's strength, not a weakness, if you believe women should be able to make our own health care decisions and that LGBT Americans should be treated equally across America, and you should be able to live up to your potential, no matter who you are or where you come from, then start voting October the 12th!"", 'And I promise you this. Together we\'re going to prove that we can make the future what it should be for all of you; that there is a positive, optimistic, confident America out there; that America\'s best days are ahead of us, not the dark and divisive vision of my opponent, but one in keeping with what I see as I travel across America – the energy, the dynamism, the entrepreneurial spirit of all Americans, but particularly young Americans. So please, join this campaign. Be part of it for the next 29 days. And together we will prove that we can have the future that we want and that yes, love trumps hate! Thank you, Ohio State!""']"
67,            Hillary Clinton          ,"October 11, 2016","['""Hello, Miami Dade College! It is so great to be here with all of you.', ""And I want to thank everyone for gathering and in particular, I want to thank all of the elected officials. Thanks to Congressman Patrick Murphy who I hope is the next senator from Florida. Thanks to Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Thank you to Mayor Phillip Levine of Miami Beach. Thanks to Mayor Phillip Stoddard of South Miami. Thanks to all the others who were part of the program. As we were coming in, we heard lots of energy coming from this crowd, and I was told as I was coming out, there's an overflow, but they can hear us in the overflow, and we're so happy you're here as well! So thanks to the overflow crowd. But what I am most excited about is to be here with one of the world's most foremost leaders on climate change: Al Gore."", ""About a decade ago, Al made a movie called 'An Inconvenient Truth.' Now, maybe some of you have seen it, but if you haven't, I hope you'll watch it tonight. It doesn't have a lot of special effects – but it does have a lot of drama."", ""And here's the main message: climate change is real, it's urgent, and America can take the lead in the world in addressing it. Right? We here in America can develop new clean energy solutions. We can transform our economy. We can rally the world to cut carbon pollution. And above all, we can fulfill our moral obligation to protect our planet for our children and our grandchildren."", ""Now, let me just say – so, so let's remember, let's remember what's at stake. I'm running against a guy who denies science, denies climate change, claims it's a hoax created by the Chinese. So this is something that Al Gore's been working on for a really long time. And I want you to know how far back he goes. It was in 1982 when he held the very first hearing on climate change in the House of Representatives with the world-famous climate scientist Jim Hansen. And then when Al became a senator, he continued to raise the alarm and look for solutions, and as vice president, he led America's efforts to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol to cut greenhouse gas emissions. You take all this together, those 30 years of leadership led Al Gore to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007."", 'I was very proud because he had been determined and persistent, and in the face of a lot of people – in public life, in business, in elsewhere who were trying to diminish the importance of the science – he never wavered. And in the years since, the climate challenge has only grown more stark. And I will tell you this, it is one of the most important issues at stake in this election.', 'Look at it this way. Our next president will either step up our efforts to address climate change, to protect our planet, to protect our health, and to create good jobs that cannot be outsourced by growing our clean energy economy. Or in the alternative, we will be dragged backwards and our whole future will be put at risk.', ""So we've really got to get this right. And if you need additional convincing, just remember what happened this week. Hurricane Matthew killed at least 26 people in our country, more than a thousand as far as we know right now in Haiti. North Carolina is still dealing with serious flooding and will be at least for the rest of the week, if not longer. We all need to support each other as our communities put the pieces back together and begin the long road back from this disaster."", ""That's why I've encouraged everyone to give what you can afford to the Florida Disaster Fund or to Team Rubicon, the veterans organization working to respond to Hurricane Matthew, or to UNICEF, helping children and families on the ground in Haiti."", ""Now, some will say, 'We've always had hurricanes. They've always been destructive.' And that's true. But Hurricane Matthew was likely more destructive because of climate change. Right now, the ocean is at or near record-high temperatures – and that contributed to the torrential rainfall and the flash flooding that we saw in the Carolinas. Sea levels have already risen about a foot – one foot – in much of the Southeast, which means that Matthew's storm surge was higher and the flooding was more severe."", ""Plus, as you know, the impact of climate change goes beyond extreme events like hurricanes. It's become a daily reality here in Miami. You have streets in Miami Beach and in Shorecrest that are flooding at high tide. The ocean is bubbling up through the sewer system. Sometimes, people call 311 because they assume a water main must have broken when actually it is the sea rising around them."", ""So, if you need proof that climate change is real and that it's costly, there you go. So at this rate, at this rate, my friends, my friends, please. Let's focus on what's really important in this election and in your future and the future of our country, because this is what I want you to hear and understand. At the rate we are going, one in eight homes in Florida could be underwater by the end of the century, and when kids – like that adorable young boy over there on his dad's shoulders – are grandparents, we believe that's more than $400 billion worth of property in Florida at risk, and nationwide, it's as much as $882 billion in property at risk."", ""But there's also health consequences. Mosquitoes that carry diseases like the Zika virus and ticks that carry Lyme disease are expanding their ranges. And hotter summers and longer pollen seasons are making allergies and asthma worse, which is especially bad for our children. And look at what is happening in California, a brutal five-year drought. Wildfires have burned more than 9 million acres in our country last year."", ""And it's also about national security. The Pentagon has identified climate change as a threat to our America's national security. The U.S. Atlantic Fleet is based in Norfolk, Virginia. It's the largest naval installation in the world. And because of rising sea level, the base is frequently flooded, even when it's sunny. So that's why the Pentagon is looking at how climate change will affect readiness and operations, not just in Norfolk, but at all of our military bases around the world."", ""So you would think if you look at the facts, if you listen to the science, that even the most committed climate skeptic would say, 'Ok, I agree, something's happening here. We need to take it seriously.'"", ""But unfortunately, there are still plenty of people – in Washington, on the campaign trail – who won't face what's happening right in front of us."", ""Donald Trump, is, quote, 'not a big believer' in climate change. As I said, he said it's a hoax created by the Chinese. And in our first debate two weeks ago, he tried to deny saying that. But that tweet is still there for everyone to see."", ""And I would wish that Donald would actually listen to people here in Florida, like Miami Beach's Mayor Philip Levine and others who are doing incredible work to address these 'Sunny Day' Floods. Or maybe, he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner John Elizabeth Alemán. Or maybe he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner, John Elizabeth Alemán. John Elizabeth is a Republican, but she's supporting our campaign—because she knows America can't afford a candidate who doesn't accept climate science. Or maybe Donald would listen to our military leaders who say climate change threatens our national security, or what about the ranchers in Colorado, or the mayors in Arizona or the community leaders in Alaska who say, 'Our lives and jobs and families are being affected – please, let's come together as a country and do something about it.'"", 'We cannot risk putting a climate denier in the White House. At all, that is absolutely unacceptable.', 'We need a president who believes in science and who has a plan to lead America in facing this threat, creating good jobs, and yes, saving our planet.', ""So here's what I want to do."", 'First, we need to do a lot more on clean energy. The clean energy superpower of the 21st century is probably going to be either Germany, China, or us—and I want it to be us. And I want you to be part of making it us.', 'And we need to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy and create high paying jobs, building and installing more solar panels and wind turbines. Modernizing our electric grid. Retrofitting buildings. Building resilient, 21st century infrastructure, and we have to make sure no community is left out or left behind—not our cities or our small towns or our remote, rural areas.', ""Now, you wouldn't know it if you only listened to my opponent talk about how terrible everything is. He has such a dark, divisive view of America, but that doesn't tell the story about what's really going on. It's actually pretty exciting. In red states and blue states, local leaders are stepping up. Rural electric co-ops are investing in community solar power and you see that across America – union workers in Michigan, union workers in Michigan are getting ready to build electric Chevys in a plant powered by clean energy. Iowa, Iowa is already getting a third of its electricity from wind. Wind turbines are going up in New England and on Lake Erie. Renewable energy is already the fastest-growing source of new jobs in America. I think that is so exciting – there are nearly 2 million people already working in energy efficiency."", 'And in Spartanburg, South Carolina, a project called ReGenesis is taking an old landfill and turning it into a solar farm. That landfill was a blight and a health threat, just 250 feet away from a residential neighborhood. Now, that same land will generate enough clean, renewable electricity to power 500 homes.', ""So this is what we can do. And I think Washington should back up and support doing more of that. As president, I want us to have 500 million solar panels installed across America by the end of my first term. And let's generate enough renewable energy to power every home in America within the decade. Let's make our buildings and factories more energy efficient and cut our oil consumption by one-third."", 'And we can get there by investing in cutting edge research, to keep developing cheaper and better clean energy technologies, investing in clean energy infrastructure and advanced manufacturing, putting big partnerships together between states, cities, and rural communities.', ""We can do all of this and create millions of good-paying jobs as we do. So I'm hoping that these good jobs will offer security and dignity while we produce the clean energy that will power the economy of the future. The clean energy solutions are being developed right here in America. We want them manufactured in America, installed in America, and putting people to work in America."", ""And while we do that, let's make sure our communities are ready for the impacts of climate change that are coming right at us. We need to invest in resilient infrastructure. Now, sometimes that will mean building a seawall; other times, let's be more creative – like in New York Harbor, where we are replanting oyster beds to form natural barriers to storm surge. Sometimes we'll overhaul an outdated sewer system to deal with flooding from heavy downpours. In Philadelphia, they're trying something else: green roofs, porous pavements, curbside gardens to help absorb storm water."", ""And here's something we don't talk enough about. Let's make sure our hospitals can stay open and operational in any kind of disaster. Because sadly, I saw what happened in New York during Hurricane Sandy, newborns who had been on respirators had to be evacuated down nine flights of stairs in one New York hospital, because the electricity went off. Nurses, I love nurses – heroic, courageous nurses were carrying those babies and manually squeezing bags of air to keep them breathing. Now, here in Miami, you know how important this is. You have retrofitted the Nicklaus Children's Hospital with a hurricane-resistant shell for exactly this reason. And every hospital in the country should follow your lead and build in more resilience."", ""And then finally, we have got to lead the world to confront the climate challenge. If we don't do it, nobody will do it. We must confront the climate challenge. There's no doubt about that. And so, let's move on with the kind of leadership that the world as well as our country deserves."", ""When I was Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to make climate change a top diplomatic priority. We fought to get China and India and other major polluters to agree for the first time in history to be part of the solution. In fact, we had to crash a secret meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark – slip past the guards – it was all very cloak and dagger. But for a really important purpose, and because of that breakthrough, and a lot of patient, persistent work, and because of American leadership, 195 nations signed on to a global agreement last December. It's called the Paris Agreement. And I am not exaggerating when I say it is our last, best chance to solve the global, climate crisis."", ""And what does Donald Trump want to do? He wants to cancel the Paris Agreement. He doesn't care what it would do to the planet. He doesn't care how much that would damage American leadership in the world. He doesn't care what it would do to the future we leave our kids and our grandkids."", ""Well, he may not care – but we do. And that's why this election is so critically important because on the ballot, it is not just my name. It's every issue we care about it's our values as a country."", 'Climate change needs to be a voting issue. We need to elect people up and down the ballot, at every level of government, who take it seriously and are willing to roll up their sleeves and get something done. Please, we cannot keep sending climate deniers and defeatists to Congress or to state houses—and certainly not to the White House.', ""And if you care about climate, your Senate race is also really important, and I'll tell you why. It is unacceptable, it is an unacceptable response for Marco Rubio, when asked about climate change to say, 'I'm not a scientist.' Well, why doesn't he ask a scientist and then maybe then he'd understand why it is so important that he, representing Florida, be committed to climate change? That's why I hope that you'll elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate."", ""Look, we need leaders who can get results. It's easy to stonewall. It's not enough to protest: we need creativity, we need hard work. And when it comes to climate change, we don't have a minute to waste."", ""So, I know it's easy to get cynical—especially about our politics. I get that. But this election matters more than any has in a really long time, and I believe that as strongly as I can, we've got to address this issue for our sakes, our children, our grandchildren. And it's so critically important when you think about how leadership can make a difference."", 'And just look, if you will – look at the difference between your state, the Sunshine State, which has less solar energy than New Jersey has right now. And do you know why? Because you have a governor who has ordered the state government never to use the words \'climate change.\' So my friends, this is a big deal in the election, and it is going to be a big deal for our country and our world. And there isn\'t anybody – there isn\'t anybody who knows more, has done more, has worked harder. I know he was in Miami just last year, training and educating people to be climate change activists. I can\'t wait to have Al Gore advising me when I am President of the United States. So please join me in welcoming our former vice president, a climate change leader and an all-around great guy, Al Gore.""']"

There were a lot of children in Ethiopia that were no longer able to live with families. Their parents, their grandparents were not around. And a lot of Americans have adopted children in need like that and this little boy named Felix is now ten years old. He's only lived in the United States. And his mother wrote me and she said that after hearing Donald Trump, he turned to her and asked, 'Mommy, will he send me back to Ethiopia?'"", ""That's the kind of fear and anxiety that I hear from immigrant families who are scared to death, especially the children, that Donald Trump is going to put together a big deportation force and go door to door, school to school, business to business, home to home."", 'And it is hard to explain to children.

We have a big difference about how best to get the economy going. You know, Trump wants to give trillions and trillions in tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires."", ""You know, that's called trickle down economics, but as with anything when it comes to Donald Trump, he wants to have the biggest tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations than we have ever, ever had.

Hillary!', ""Well, you know, you do have to feel a little sorry for them. They've had a really bad couple of weeks."", ""But you know, part of the difference in how we see the economy I think comes from our experiences. You know, Donald grew up the son of a millionaire. He got started in business by borrowing $14 million from his dad. So it's not a surprise he wants to keep giving back to the wealthy, because that's his own experience. I grew up differently. My father was a factory worker. Well, my grandfather was a factory worker. My father was a small businessman.

We are going to make public college tuition free for working families and debt free for everyone else.', ""If you already have debt because you're trying to get your education, we're going to help you refinance it.

I can't wait to work with Senator Bennet, I can't wait to have a chance to make sure that we are working on immigration reform from the very beginning. We're gonna finally help dreamers achieve their dream of following their future and becoming American citizens."", ""I also think it is past time, don't you, to guarantee equal pay for women's work?"", ""You know I started talking about equal pay years and years and years ago because it's not only a woman's issue it's a family issue. If you have a wife or a daughter or a mother or a sister it's your issue. Right? You know that."", ""So Donald Trump always says, you know I'm playing the woman card. And my response is pretty simple. If being for equal pay and affordable childcare and paid family leave is playing the woman's card, then deal me in."", 'You see I am very excited, I am very excited about what we could do. You know I give President Obama a lot of credit. He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. I remember, because he called and asked me to come see him shortly after the election.', 'And I didn\'t know why. He wanted me to be secretary of state but I didn\'t know that. But I got there and the first thing he says is, ""It\'s so much worse than they told us.""', ""And it was. You remember. It was terrible. Millions of people lost their jobs and homes were lost and it was just a horrible time. We have dug ourselves out of that ditch, thanks to everybody's hard work."", ""And we can't ever go back there because believe me, trickle-down economics and refusing to regulate Wall Street and the mortgage market is what got us into that mess in the first place."", ""And Donald Trump wants to get rid of the new rules on Wall Street. He wants to get rid of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which returns money to people who've been defrauded by big companies. Well I have a totally different view."", ""We're gonna keep those and then we're going to tell companies that try to move jobs out of our country that if they try to they're gonna have to pay an exit tax and return every penny, every penny, of tax benefit they've ever gotten."", ""And I've been very clear about how we're gonna pay for what I want to do. It is going to be going after the wealthy, closing the loopholes on corporations."", 'I can pledge to you, I will never raise middle class federal taxes.

And we thank you very much."", 'What - right now - thank you.', ""You know, I always feel so welcome when I come to Pueblo. I think I'll come here anytime it gets hard in the White House. What do you say?"", 'Finally I want to tell you that I want to make it easier for you to raise your kids. You know, there is nothing more important.', ""I'm now a grandmother of two wonderful grandchildren, a little girl, a little boy. And there are too many hard-working families struggling with the cost of raising children."", ""So right now most families with kids get something called the child tax credit. It gives a middle-class family $1000 per child to help you defray the costs. I'm going to double - I'm going to double the child tax credit."", ""That's another $1,000 for young kids to pay for the things you need, whether it's child care, housing, prescription drugs, groceries, or anything else, it is just one example of the tax relief I want to give to working families and we're going to make sure that it gets to the people who need it most."", ""We're going to lift families out of poverty. In fact, the changes I am proposing we think will automatically help more people get out of poverty and we're going to look for other ways to help you."", 'What I am interested in is your success, your futures, your possibilities, your dreams. I want to be a president who makes it possible for more people to feel like they are really moving and their kids are going to have better lives.', ""That is how I was raised. That's what I want for you and every single family, every single child in America!"", ""So we have about four weeks ago. It's going to be - it's going to be a race to the finish line, my friends. And here is what I want to ask you."", 'As I said in the beginning, think about everything that is important to you, whether it is jobs and rising incomes, whether it is education, healthcare, whatever it might be. Whether it is protecting our rights.', 'People who have fought so hard, whether it is immigration reform, whatever it might be, think about it because you know what?', 'Those issues will be on the ballot. They may not be listed there, but you could not have two more different people running for president than me and Donald Trump.', ""And I know that if people turn out, I know if people show up, we're going to win and we're going to be able to do everything I've talked about."", 'And so it call comes to down whether or not you take that ballot you get in the mail, you fill it in, you send it back, you do everything you can to make sure that your vote will be counted.', 'You know, when I think about this election, I do think about my grandchildren a lot. Yeah, you, too, right?', ""I'll tell you what, for those of you who aren't grandparents yet, it is an incredible experience. Right?"", ""And there is nothing I wouldn't do for them. As I like to say, face time was invented for grandparents, and you get to check in and see how they're doing. But more than that, what kind of lives are they going to have and what kind of country is going to be waiting for them?"", ""I know how important it is that families and communities and our country stand behind every child. Make sure every child has a good education, a good school, good teachers, and every zip code in America. Make sure every child -- every child has the healthcare that he or she needs. That's why I work to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, so we can take care of millions of children."", ""That's why every family deserves to have a good job with a good income to be able to be good providers for their kids."", ""I got into this work so many years ago. I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, right out of law school. And I spent my time trying to figure out how you even the odds for all kids. And the reason I did that is because of my own mother."", ""I didn't know it when I was just a little girl, but I learned as I got older that my mother was abandoned and neglected by her parents and pretty much left on her own, and then at the age of eight, holding her little three-year-old sister's hand, she was put on a train by themselves to go to California to live with grandparents."", ""It turned out the grandparents didn't really want her either. So by the age of 14, she was working in a house as a maid and a babysitter. But here's what I want you to know. It sounds pretty harsh. It was difficult. It made a profound impression on her life. I think my mom, who lived to the wonderful age of 92, I don't think there was a day that went by that she didn't think about being abandoned and being sent away and being pretty much left on her own."", 'But, along the way, people were kind to her. People helped her. The first grade teacher who brought lunch for her every day, because my mother never had any -- the woman whose house she went to work in all those years ago knew my mother wanted to go to high school, so she said to her, Dorothy, if you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school.', ""Now, you'll have to come right back home. That might sound kind of unfortunate, but for my mom, it was a gift, because she really wanted to go to high school."", 'And so my mother always cared about other people. And she taught me in every way she could that nobody is better than anybody else, right.', 'And we need to show each other more kindness and support. And the last thing we need in our country are more bullies making people feel bad about themselves and pushing people away, we should be drawing people toward us.', ""We should be creating the kind of future we want for every one of our children. That's what I think about when I imagine, if I'm so fortunate enough to become president, I think about waking up -- waking up —"", 'I think about waking up in the White House every morning trying to figure out what can I do to help somebody else and who can I work with? How many families and communities across America will work with us to come up with ideas that give every single child the chance to live up to his or her God given potential?', ""That's what I think we are called to do. Whether you're a person of faith or not, the American dream is really premised on people coming together to lift each other up. Nobody, nobody makes it alone. Everybody has somebody who helps them along the way."", 'So let\'s pull together, Pueblo, let\'s get out and vote for the kind of positive future we want for ourselves and our children.

69,            Hillary Clinton          ,"October 20, 2016","['Secretary Clinton: ""Thank you. Your Eminence, Your Excellencies, members of the clergy, Al and Nan Smith, Donald and Melania, and all the distinguished guests.', ""You know, earlier tonight, Al reminded me that when the first Al Smith ran for presi-dent, he chose as his running mate the progressive senator from Arkansas, Joseph T. Robinson, who was one of my husband's political heroes."", ""This work that you do through the dinner — Al, you've done it now for 30 — 30 years — is such a labor of love. You've been a hero for both the children of the archdiocese and for the city of New York. And I think we all owe Al Smith a great, great round of applause."", 'This is such a special event that I took a break from my rigorous nap schedule to be here.', ""And as you've already heard, it's a treat for all of you too, because usually I charge a lot for speeches like this."", ""But, for me, it was kind of ironic thinking about a fiery populist, Al Smith. If he were here today and saw how much money we've raised for needy children, he'd be very proud."", ""And if he saw this magnificent room, full of plutocrats celebrating his legacy, he'd be very confused."", 'It\'s a special honor to be here with Your Eminence. Now I know, Your Eminence, you were criticized for inviting both Donald and me here tonight, and you responded by saying ""If I only sat down with those who were saints, I\'d be taking all my meals alone.""', ""Now, just to be clear, I think the Cardinal is saying I'm not eligible for sainthood. But getting through these three debates with Donald has to count as a miracle."", ""So I guess I'm up against the highest, hardest stained-glass ceiling. But, Your Eminence, you deserve great credit for bringing together two people who've been at each other's throats — mortal enemies, bitter foes; I've got to ask, how did you get the governor and mayor here together tonight?"", ""Now, I've got to say, there are a lot of friendly faces here in this room; people that I've been privileged to know and to work with. I just want to put you all in a basket of adorables."", 'And you look so good in your tuxes; or, as I refer to them, formal pantsuits.', 'And, you know, because this is a friendly dinner for such a great cause; Donald, if at any time, you don\'t like what I\'m saying feel free to stand up and shout ""Wrong!"" while I\'m talking.', ""You know, come to think of it, it's amazing I'm up here after Donald. I didn't think he'd be okay with a peaceful transition of power."", 'And, Donald, after listening to your speech, I will also enjoy listening to Mike Pence deny that you ever gave it.', ""You know, I've had the privilege of being at the Al Smith dinners in years past and I always enjoy it. But, remember, if you're not happy with the way it comes out, it must be rigged."", ""And it's always a special treat for me to be back in New York; a city that I love and which I think truly embodies the best of America. You know — don't you think?"", 'People look at the Statue of Liberty and they see a proud symbol of our history as a nation of immigrants, a beacon of hope for people around the world. Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a ""four.""', 'Maybe a ""five"" if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair.', 'You know, come to think of it, you know what would be a good number for a woman? Forty-five.', ""But I digress. Now, I'm going to try my best tonight, but I understand I am not known for my sense of humor. That's why it did take a village to write these jokes."", ""People say — and I hear them, I know — they say I'm boring compared to Donald. But I'm not boring at all. In fact, I'm the life of every party I attend and I've been to three."", ""And when the parties get out of hand, as occasionally they do, it's important to have a responsible chaperone who can get everyone home safely. And that is why I picked Tim Kaine to be my Vice President."", ""Now, you notice there is no teleprompter here tonight, which is probably smart, because maybe you saw Donald dismantle his prompter the other day. And I get that. They're hard to keep up with, and I'm sure it's even harder when you're translating from the original Russian."", 'But every year, this dinner brings together a collection of sensible, committed, main-stream Republicans — or, as we now like to call them — Hillary supporters.', 'Now, some of my critics — and I hear that too —', 'Audience Member: Yeah.', 'Secretary Clinton: Yeah.', ""They think I only say what people want to hear. Well, tonight, that is true. And here's exactly what you want to hear — this election will be over very, very soon."", ""And look at this dais — we've got Charlie Rose, and Maria Bartiromo, and Chris Mat-thews, and Gayle King, and Norah O'Donnell, and Katie Couric — this counts as a press conference, right?"", 'It is great, also, to see Mayor Bloomberg here.', ""It's a shame he's not speaking tonight. I'm curious to hear what a billionaire has to say."", ""And look at the dais — we've got the Honorable Chuck Schumer, the Honorable Andrew Cuomo, the Honorable Mike Bloomberg, the Honorable Bill DeBlasio, the Honorable Dave Dinkins, and so many other wonderful elected officials. And we have Rudy Giuliani."", 'Now, many don\'t know this, but Rudy actually got his start as a prosecutor going after wealthy New Yorkers who avoided paying taxes. But, as the saying goes, ""If you can\'t beat them, go on Fox News and call them a genius.""', ""So as I've said, we've now had our third and, thankfully, final debate. Sharing a stage with Donald Trump is like, well, nothing really comes to mind."", ""There is nothing like sharing a stage with Donald Trump. Donald wanted me drug tested before last night's debate. And look, I've got to tell you, I am so flattered that Donald thought I used some sort of performance enhancer."", ""Now, actually, I did. It's called preparation."", ""And looking back, I've had to listen to Donald for three full debates. And he says I don't have any stamina."", 'That is four and a half hours. I have now stood next to Donald Trump longer than any of his campaign managers.', ""Now, look, I have deep respect for people like Kellyanne Conway. She's working day and night for Donald and because she's a contractor, he's probably not even going to pay her."", ""But I think the good news is that the debates finally allowed Republicans to unite around their candidate. The bad news is, it's Mike Pence. And it's been a long, long campaign. That should be one of our highest priorities, shortening the campaigns."", ""And whoever wins this election, the outcome will be historic. We'll either have the first female president or the first president who started a Twitter war with Cher."", ""And if Donald does win, it will be awkward at the annual President's Day photo, when all the former presidents gather at the White House, and not just with Bill."", 'How is Barack going to get past the Muslim ban?', ""Now, Republicans in particular seem frustrated with their nominee. Paul Ryan told the Republican members of the House, you — you don't have to support the top of the ticket. Don't worry about anyone besides yourself. Just do what's in your own best interests. So I guess Donald really has unified his party around his core philosophy."", ""And I don't understand their unhappiness. They say Donald doesn't have any policies. He has no policies. I keep hearing that."", ""I'd actually like to defend him on this. Donald has issues, serious issues."", 'Really, really serious issues.', ""And I worry about Donald's go it alone attitude. For example, at his convention, when he said I alone can fix it, you know, in the '90s, I said the same thing about America's health care system and it didn't work out so well for me, either."", 'But speaking of health, Donald has been very concerned about mine, very concerned. He actually sent a car to bring me here tonight. Actually, it was a hearse.', ""But I — but I kind of want to just put the information out there, so everybody can draw their own conclusions and you can judge our relative health. We've each released our medical records. My blood pressure is 100/70. His is unbelievably great."", 'My cholesterol is 189, his is presidential.', 'My heart rate is 72 beats per minute, his is the most beats ever, or the least beats ever, whichever sounds best.', 'But Donald really is as healthy as a horse, you know, the one Vladimir Putin rides around on.', 'But — but I can say without fear of contradiction tonight, that I will be the healthiest and youngest woman ever to serve as president.', ""But this has really been a strange campaign. You saw it last night. You saw it again tonight. Donald has attacked me for a life in public service and I didn't get that at first. I kind of get it now. As he told Howard Stern, he doesn't like it when women have been around for more than 35 years."", 'But Donald, we have so much more in common than, actually, you may realize.', ""For example, I tried to inspire young people by showing them that with resilience and hard work anything is possible and you're doing the same. A third grade teacher told me that one of her students refused to turn in his homework because it was under audit."", ""And here's another similarity. The Republican National Committee isn't spending a dime to help either one of us."", ""So tonight, let's embrace the spirit of the evening. Let's come together. Remember what unites us and just rip on Ted Cruz."", 'I hope you enjoyed my remarks tonight. I said no to some jokes that I thought were over the line. But I suppose you can judge for yourself on Wikileaks in the next few days.', 'Donald will tell us after the benediction whether he accepts that this dinner is over. He has to wait and see.', ""But there's nothing funny about the stakes in this election. In the end what makes this dinner important are not the jokes we tell but the legacy that we carry forward. It is often easy to forget how far this country has come."", 'And there are a lot of people in this room tonight who themselves, or their parents or grandparents, came here as immigrants, made a life for yourselves, took advantage of the American dream and the greatest system that has ever been created in the history of the world to unleash the individual talents and energy and ambition of everyone willing to work hard.', ""And when I think about what Al Smith went through it's important to just reflect how groundbreaking it was for him, a Catholic, to be my party's nominee for president. Don't forget – school boards sent home letters with children saying that if Al Smith is elected president you will not be allowed to have or read a Bible. Voters were told that he would annul Protestant marriages."", 'And I saw a story recently that said people even claimed the Holland Tunnel was a se-cret passageway to connect Rome and America, to help the Pope rule our country.', 'Those appeals, appeals to fear and division, can cause us to treat each other as the Other. Rhetoric like that makes it harder for us to see each other, to respect each other, to listen to each other. And certainly a lot harder to love our neighbor as ourselves.', ""I believe how we treat others is the highest expression of faith and of service. I'm not Catholic. I'm a Methodist, but one of the things that we share is the belief that in order to achieve salvation we need both faith and good works. And you certainly don't need to be Catholic to be inspired by the humility and heart of the Holy Father, Pope Francis. Or to embrace his message."", 'His message about rejecting a mindset of hostility, his calls to reduce inequality, his warnings about climate change, his appeal that we build bridges, not walls.', 'Now as you may know, my running mate, Tim, is Catholic and went to Jesuit schools, and one of the things he and I have talked about is this idea from the Jesuits of the Magis, the more, the better. But we need to get better at finding ways to disagree on matters of policy while agreeing on questions of decency and civility. How we talk to each other, treat each other, respect each other.', ""So I've taken this concept of Magis to heart in this campaign, as best as one can in the daily heat, the back and forth of a presidential campaign, to ask how we can do more for each other, and better for each other. Because I believe that for each of us, our greatest monument on this earth won't be what we build, but the lives we touch."", 'And that is ultimately what this dinner is all about. And it\'s why it\'s been such a great honor to join you all again. Thank you.""']"

What a year for Cleveland, you really are ""Believe Land.""', 'Now I, for one, am hoping for a Great Lakes series, I spent a lot of days at Wrigley field as a kid, so that would be a dream come true for me, to have Cleveland and Chicago in World Series, and for us to win Ohio.', ""I want to thank all of the people who are here today because you've heard from some great, great folks. I want to thank Governor Ted Strickland, our candidate to the United States Senate. I'll tell you, we could really use a Democratic senate to get things done for the people of Ohio and America."", 'I wanna thank Mayor Frank Jackson, County Executive, Armond Budish. I wanna thank my great friend from Youngstown, Congressman Tim Ryan.', ""And we need you all in. We need you all in. You're rallying together and we need to rally together because you know, I really believe we are stronger together!"", 'Anybody watch the debate Wednesday night? Well, that was the third and last time. That I will ever have to debate Donald Trump.', 'I have now spent four and a half hours on stage with Donald, proving once again, I have the stamina to be president and commander in chief.', 'Really, you -- you just have to be a good cheer when you find yourself in situations like that.', ""And because I love this country and I believe in the American people, I could feel so clear in my own mind and my heart about what we can do together. So no matter what he was saying, I just kept thinking of all the people that I have met throughout this campaign. And I had the chance to talk about some of the most important concerns on people's minds, what keeps you up at night. And as I said then and as I have said continuously, we're going to invest in the middle class."", ""We're going to invest in you and your families. We're going to make sure we produce enough good jobs with rising incomes that every single person, especially every single young American here today, will have the chance to go as far as your talents and your hard work will take you."", ""And we're also going to protect our children from gun violence. We are not going to tolerate the kind of gun violence epidemic that has swept this country and results in the deaths of 33,000 people a year. We can come together to meet our challenges, no matter what they are."", 'But on Wednesday night, Donald Trump did something no other presidential nominee has ever done. He refused to say that he would respect the results of this election.', 'Now, make no mistake. By doing that, he is threatening our democracy.', ""He is basically saying hey, we've been around 240 years and we've always had peaceful transitions no matter who won or who lost. Look, if you lose an election -- I've lost elections, you don't feel very good the next day, do you?"", 'But we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship, right?', ""And the peaceful transition -- the peaceful transition of power is one of the things that sets us apart. It's how we hold our country together no matter who's in charge. You know, I went to 112 countries as your secretary of state and I -- I saw the difference between what we do and what others do, I was in countries where people jail their political opponents or execute them or exile them. Or invalidate elections that they didn't win."", ""That can never be allowed to happen here. I believe that's true no matter who you support in this election, whether or not you support me. Or you support my opponent, together, we must support American democracy and the country that has given every one of us so many opportunities."", 'And the best way to do that, my friends, is to turn out and vote.', '[points to an audience member holding a sign]', ""Those are great. That is great. I'm excited because we are well on our way, there is an inspiring story being written right now by people across America, and many of you are getting involved in this election, some of you for the first time in your lives. We now have in America more than 200 million registered voters."", 'That is more than we have ever had in our entire history, and that is really good news for our democracy. More than 50 million millennials have registered.', 'You know what that means? Young people will determine the outcome of this election, which I think is good news. That means our future is in good hands.', 'And listen to this, because this is really exciting. More than 4 million people have already voted.', 'Including many people right here in Ohio.', 'In fact, in the first four days of in-person early voting here in Ohio, more people showed up to vote than they did at the same time in 2012, in our last election.', ""That is fantastic and it shows how serious people are taking this election. So numbers like that remind us that no matter all the negativity that's out there, there is something really exciting happening right now. People are coming together. Democrats, Republicans, independents, all of us to reject hate and division."", 'People are motivated to vote early, to defend core American values, to embrace a future where every person counts, everyone has a place, and everyone can contribute. That is my vision. I have a hopeful, optimistic, unifying vision for what our country will be. Because from the beginning, our campaign has been focused on ideas, not insults, on bringing people together, not tearing us apart.', 'And I want all of you to know that that is true not only for the campaign, but if I am fortunate enough to be your president, I want you to know, and I want you to tell anybody you know, any friends, or colleagues at school or work, or your neighborhood who may be planning to support the other guy, here is what I want you to tell them.', ""I want you to tell them that I want to be their president. I want to be every single American's president, whether you agree or disagree, whether you vote for me or against me."", 'I believe we can disagree without being disagreeable. I believe that. And I have seen that happen. I want to be a good listener. I know there are a lot of people here in Ohio who are discouraged, frustrated, even angry about what is going on in their lives, about losing jobs, they are upset about what they see happening around them. I get that.', 'But I think anger is not a plan. We need plans that will help us deal with the legitimate concerns and questions that people have here in Ohio. I think that is what the country needs now. And that is what I will try to offer.', ""CLINTON: I am not going to pretend that we can just snap our fingers and solve our problems. That would not be fair. It wouldn't be true. But I know we can make progress together and you deserve something to vote for, not just against."", 'So I want to speak directly to the challenges that a lot of people here in Ohio face, especially when it comes to our economy. You see I believe really simply that when the middle class thrives, America thrives. When we build the economy from the middle out and the ground up, not from the top down, we are more likely to provide better lives, better incomes, better opportunities for more Americans.', ""My opponent has a different perspective. He really believes if you give trillions, that's with a T, trillions in tax cuts to the wealthy, to millionaires and billionaires and corporations, everything will work out. It's really trickle down on steroids. I believe differently that we must invest in working families in the middle class, in small businesses, that will power the economy."", ""And that's what we're going to do. We're going to get the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top who have done pretty well over the last years. Now Donald likes to say he's on the side of American workers but his actions tell a different story. He has been buying cheap Chinese steel and aluminum for his construction projects when he should be buying good American made steel that supports good American jobs."", ""And this is a very important issue here in Ohio because you're one of the largest steel producing states in America so you understand how important this is to support the American steel industry so I'm going to let Donald try to explain himself to the steel workers filing for unemployment. He has put Chinese steel workers to work, not American steel workers and we're going to change that."", ""And for all of his talk about putting America first, he's made his products in at least 12 other countries. Trump's suits were made in Mexico. They could have been made in Brooklyn, Ohio. Trump's furniture is made in Turkey and it could have been made in Cleveland. Trump barware is made in Slovenia instead of Toledo. So if he wants to make America great again, why doesn't he start by making things in America again?"", ""And we also know that he hasn't paid a dime in federal income tax for years."", ""He says that makes him smart. Well, I don't know how smart you have to be to lose $1 billion in a year in the first place. But what that means is everybody else here, all of us, have paid more in federal income taxes than a billionaire, right? And that means he's contributed zero, zero for our military or our vets, zero for Pell grants to help young people go to college, zero for our highways or investing in clean energy or other ways to help us with new jobs for the future."", 'Now Tim Kaine and I, we have a different view. We want to make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II. Jobs in infrastructure and manufacturing, clean energy, technology and small business. We are going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.', ""And I've set some big goals. I want us to deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term."", 'And enough clean energy to power every home within 10 years.', ""We're also going to strengthen education at every level starting with universal pre-kindergarten education."", 'And we want good schools with good teachers in every zip code so that every kid gets a world class education. I want us to bring back technical education in high school. I think it was a mistake when we took it out of our high schools.', ""And let's remember, it's at community colleges like this that thousands and thousands of people in our country, of all ages, get such a good start."", ""And I'm going to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year."", ""Education should lift you up, not hold you back. And we're going to help you, we're going to help you pay back and pay down your loans. Too many young people are burdened by those debts."", ""It's going to be great to help you pay it back as a percentage of your income, so you're never on the hook for more than you can afford. Senator Bernie Sanders and I worked on this plan together."", ""It's going to help save millions of people thousands of dollars, and you can actually go to HillaryClinton.com/calculator to see how much money you and your family could save with our plan."", 'I also want to do more for apprenticeship programs. I thank all the unions represented here for the great apprentice programs that you have in place. Thank you.', 'I want to support apprenticeship programs and skills trainings with business and labor unions, because there are going to be good jobs out there for welders, and machinists, and health technicians, and computer coders, and so much more. I want everybody to have the chance to get your piece of the American dream, and I think the American dream is big enough for everybody.', ""And we're going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works full-time should still be in poverty."", 'As I said in the debate the other night, I want to make sure that we take care of people on Social Security who were low-income workers and women, particularly widows, who lose have of their monthly payment when their husbands die.', ""We've got to do more to make sure Social Security provides a decent income for our seniors. And, yes, don't you think it's finally time to guarantee equal pay for women's work?"", ""Now the equal pay issue is important in and of itself because, if you've got a mother or a wife or a daughter or a sister who's working, you want her to be paid fairly. I mean that's good for the entire family, right?"", ""But the equal pay issue gets at something even deeper. We've got to make sure that women and girls are treated with the dignity and respect in our country that they deserve."", ""We cannot -- we cannot tolerate the kind of behavior and language we've seen from my opponent. He thinks that belittling women makes him bigger. Goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there's a woman anywhere who doesn't know how that feels."", ""So we're going to stand up for everybody, men and women, retirees, the young, millennials, everybody deserves to be treated with respect and dignity."", ""And I have said repeatedly that we're going to reform the criminal justice system so that it works fairly for everyone. And we have to address systemic racism that is still too big a part of our lives together."", ""I want to give credit to all the young people, and really people of all ages, who've been marching and speaking out, doing everything you can to make sure that issues of policing and mass incarceration, environmental justice, economic justice, educational equity, gun violence, voting rights, that they get the attention they deserve. Because it's important that we lift these issues up and work to make sure that everybody in our country feels like they are seen and they are heard.

But today was a real opportunity for us."", 'I just want to make two quick points. First, as we are traveling in the last 17 days, we are going to be emphasizing the importance of electing democrats down ballot.', 'And in particular, as I said today, we are strongly supportive of Katie Mcginty in her race for the senate. We will be, I think, meeting up with her in Philadelphia tonight. So we will have a chance to do that with her. I will be doing the same as we go from state to state, as will Tim.', 'The other point is today, we are making our closing arguments. We are talking about what is at stake in the election we are drawing contrasts, but we are giving people something to vote for, not just against.', ""And I saw where our opponent Donald Trump went to Gettysburg, one of the most extraordinary places in American history, and basically said, if he's president, he will spend his time suing women who have made charges against him based on his behavior."", 'Tim and I are going to keep talking about what we want to do if we are given the great honor of serving as president and vice president. As we said in the book, ""Stronger To-gether"" we have very specific plans.', 'And we are going to get together after the election and do everything possible to be prepared on January 20th to start doing the business of the American people.', 'Reporter: Secretary Clinton, Trump today also suggested that democrats or the Clinton campaign were behind these women coming forward and making these accusations. What do you have to say to that?', 'Secretary Clinton: That is just not accurate.', 'Reporter: We have started to hear some republicans say that it if you win, it will not be because American voters have endorsed your platform, but rather that they have rejected Trumps. How would you respond to that, and would that get in the way of an effort to bring the country back together, and have a mandate for the presidency?', 'Secretary Clinton: Well clearly we are going to spend the next 17 days making the case to persuade as many Americans as possible across our country to vote for Tim and me.', 'We have close elections in America. You can go back and check that out for the last 4, 6, 8 of them. it is not unusual that the election would be close.', 'So we are not taking anything for granted. We are working our hearts out and covering as much ground.', 'We have great events planned. We have great surrogates coming out to support us that are both campaigning with us and campaigning on their own to try to convince as many people as possible to go vote.', ""As i said in pittsburgh, we are seeing some really encouraging signs about the turnout. the 200 million voter registration mark is huge, it's never been reached before. 50 million as the best estimate being young people is so encouraging."", ""And then what we are seeing from early vote returns, I think we are over 4 million already. So I am not going to speculate about the outcome of the election, people know what Tim and I want to do. We have been very clear about that. We've laid it out in every way that we could in every different kind of forum. And I am going to be reaching out to people on the other side of the aisle, to everybody that will possibly come together with us."", 'Reporter: Do you see any of the outreach you have done to republicans who have rejected Donald Trump as carrying over into your potential administration? And how would fishers in the party impact some of those big items on your agenda, particularly immigration?', 'Secretary Clinton: Amy, I am very encouraged by what I think we can get accomplished. I came into the senate in 2000 as you know, and I made it clear from the beginning that I wanted work with people.', ""I didn't have any expectations about being treated any differently than anybody else. And I think you can go back and look at the record that I compiled by working with practically every republican I served with."", ""I think, last time we had it counted, 400 bills have my name on them either as a sponsor or cosponsor. You don't get that done unless you work with folks on the other side."", 'So I have a record of doing that, not just in the senate, but as first lady and secretary of state. And people know that. And we will begin to get to work right away and reach out to everybody that we can possibly touch to start talking about what we can do together. And I think there is a big agenda where we can find common ground.', 'Reporter: Madam Secretary, have you thought at all about who you might put in your cabinet if you win?', ""Clinton: No I really haven't. I am a little superstitious about that. We have got a transition operation going, and I haven't really paid much attention to it yet because I want to focus on what our first task is, and that is convincing as many Americans as possible to give us the chance to serve."", 'Reporter: What kind of qualities are you looking for—', 'Secretary Clinton: I am not going to talk anymore about that.', ""Reporter: I was wondering, you touched on it earlier at the event, but what would your response be to trump's assertion that there is a vast media conspiracy against him supporting your campaign?"", 'Secretary Clinton: You know, I debated him for 4.5 hours. I am not even going to think about responding to him anymore.', ""I will let the American people think about what he offers and what we offer. He can say whatever he wants and he can run his campaign however he wants to. He can go off on tangents, he can go to Gettysburg and say he's going to sue women who have made accusations against him."", 'I am going to keep talking about what we want to do, what we think the country de-serves from the next president and vice president. And actually when it comes right down to it, that is what I think people end up voting on. Thank you all very much.', ""Reporter: Secretary Clinton, are you truly concerned that Donald trump would try to throw you in jail if he were elected? And one other issue, there was a Wikileaks email in which one of you top aids said that a Clinton Foundation conference, that's now being labeled by some of your critics as a pay to play scheme, was a mess of your own making. Would you comment on that as well?"", 'Secretary Clinton: No, I have nothing to say about Wikileaks, other than I think we should all be concerned about what the Russians are trying to do to our election and using Wikileaks very blatantly to try to influence the outcome of the election.

It is so great to be back here in Pittsburgh.', 'I do not think it gets any better than to be accompanied out onto the stage by Dan and Pat Rooney.', 'I am a big admirer of the Rooney family and I was so honored to serve with Dan when he was our ambassador to Ireland.', ""The Rooney family commitment to Pittsburgh is really extraordinary, and it's not just the amazing commitment to the Stealers. As special as that is, but to their roots, what they believe in, their values, and their deep concern for future generations. So I am incredibly humbled to be supported by Dan and Pat and the Rooney family. It means a great deal to both Tim and me."", 'I also want to thank congressman Mike Doyle who is here with us.

I am thrilled to be here with Tim Kaine.', 'I asked him to be my running mate because I knew he would be one of the smartest, toughest, most qualified vice presidents we have ever had. And I also knew he had never lost an election.', 'I kind of figured that might rub off on me a little bit. Now that I have gotten to spend more time with him, and with his wonderful wife Anne and their family, I am even more confident that he will be such an extraordinary leader for our country. He is not just smart, tough and qualified, Tim Kaine is as good and decent a person as you will ever meet.', 'I am deeply honored to have him by my side in this campaign. Tim and I are excited by all of the energy and enthusiasm we are seeing across the country, and particularly here in Pennsylvania.', ""But both of us, unlike our opponent, do not believe we can do this alone. We believe that we are going to do this by working with all of you. And that we are going to come together in the next 17 days and convince everybody you can to get out and vote because whatever issue you care about, it's going to be on the ballot. It may not be listed, but it will be on the ballot."", 'Whether you care about new, good jobs with a rising incomes or you care about better education or you care about what we can do to get the cost of prescription drugs down. What ever it is you care about, it is literally going to be on that ballot.', ""Now, my name and Tim's name may be the ones on the ballot, but we are going to be representing everything that we can do that you hope for our country. And we're going to need help doing that after the election, and that is why I hope you will do everything you can to elect Katie Mcginty, your next senator."", 'You know, Katie is the daughter of a Philadelphia police officer. I think she is one of 10 children, right? One of 10 children. She has devoted her professional life to protecting working families. I have known her now for more than 20 years, when she was really young, and I have seen that same can-do spirit. She just gets up every day, and asks what can she do to fight for healthier neighborhoods, to keep our kids and healthy, to fight for cleaner air and cleaner water, to help people make the most out of their own lives.', 'Now she is running for the senate, because like Tim and I, she believes our economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top.', ""Katie is exactly the kind of partner we need in the senate. But more importantly, she is exactly the kind of senator that Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania needs in the senate. We have got to get things done for the people of Pennsylvania and America, and Katie will help us break through the gridlock, actually make a difference in people's lives, help us create more good jobs with rising incomes, guarantee equal pay for women, defending planned parenthood."", ""And I think it is pretty clear when you look at Katie's opponent -- he still refuses to stand up to Donald Trump."", ""A lot of republicans have. They have had the grit to stand up and say 'he does not represent me'."", ""But Pat Toomey heard Donald attack a grieving gold star family who lost their son in Iraq. He heard Donald called Mexican immigrants rapists, he heard him say terrible things about women. He heard him spread the lie that our first black president wasn't really born in America -- how much more does Pat Toomey need to hear? If he doesn't have the courage to stand up to Donald Trump after all this, then can you be sure he will stand up for you when it counts against powerful interests?"", ""So, you know, when I look at this, I'm thinking to myself, we have work to do in Washington. And I know it's not easy. I understand we have some real challenges. I believe we can do it. I would not be standing here, Tim would not be with me -- but we need people in Washington who put you first, who get up every day thinking about middle-class families, who worry about where you are going to get the money to send your kids to college, how you are going to take care of your mom or dad because they are failing and what are you going to do for them? How are you going to deal with all of the challenges? That is what I try to do my entire life. That is who you should be electing, people who care about you, your families, your children."", 'Now, as Tim said, he asked if any of you watched the debate on Wednesday. Well, I will tell you, that was the third and last time I will ever have to debate Donald Trump.', 'I mean, think about this, I have now spent 4 and a half hours on stage with Donald, proving once again I have the stamina to be President and commander in chief.', ""And after every one of those debates, people have said, how did you do that? And really, you just have to be of good cheer when you find yourself in a situation like that. You are in front of 50, 60, 70, 80 million people. So, no matter what he would say, I just kept thinking of all the people I have met throughout this campaign. Just early today I've met Henry over there. Henry is on top of his dad's shoulders, and Henry gave me a note saying he hoped I would be president, and you know, I really want to be president for all of the kids in America to do everything I can to help you."", 'You know, I also did have a chance to talk about some of the important concerns people have shared with me. From the first day I started this campaign back in april 2015, people have been telling me what is on their minds, and it is one of the greatest honors.', ""You know, sometimes it is just fleeting. I will be in a coffee shop shaking hands or I will come down and shake hands on a rope line, just running into somebody. And that person, that man or woman or that young person takes a moment to stop, looks into my eyes. I can tell they are trying to take my measure, and I am grateful that they take their vote, their choice so seriously. And then they might say something like, I have a really terrible problem in my family. My son or my daughter has gotten addicted to opiates or to heroin. What are you going to do about it? Or maybe they will say, my brother has schizophrenia, and we can't afford to get him the kind of consistent care he needs . Or maybe they will say, I am a diabetic. And the drug company has just raised the cost of insulin, and I can't afford it. What are you going to do about it?"", 'That is the right question to ask anybody running for president, because at the end of the day, this is about you. As I said the other night, we are going to invest in the middle class. We are going to grow this economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.', 'And we are going to make sure that we produce a enough good jobs with rising incomes so that every single person, especially every single young person in America can go as far as your hard work and talent will take you.', ""Now, I've got to say, I believe in hard work. That is how I was raised. I believe you've got to work for what you get in life. But I think we have to knock down some of the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and going as far as they should. For me, that starts by believing in our country."", 'You know, there has been no other place in the history of the world that has given so much opportunity to so many. Do we have problems? We have problems. Do we have challenges? Of course we do. We are human beings. But boy, there is no more blessed place. And Donald Trump did something the other night that no other presidential nominee has ever done of either party. He refused to say he would respect the results of this election.', ""Make no mistakes about this, my friends. He is threatening our democracy. Look, I have lost elections. You don't feel very good the next day, believe me. But we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship, right?"", 'You know, the peaceful transition of power is one of those things that sets us apart, and whether you support me or my opponent, together we must show we support American democracy. And I believe both Donald Trump and I should be grateful for the opportunities that our country has given us. And the best way to demonstrate that we support our democracy is to turn out and vote. And there is an inspiring story being written by people across America right now. We have just reached a milestone, more than 200 million Americans are registered to vote in this election.', 'And you know what? That includes 50 -- more than 50 million young people. More than ever before. I find that a very hopeful sign. And here in Pennsylvania, hundreds of thousands of more voters are registered then were in 2012. What does this tell us? I think it tells us no matter how much negativity is out there, something exciting is happening right now. People are coming together -- democrats, republicans, independents -- all to reject hate and division.', 'And in the states where they can, people are motivated to vote early, to defend core American values, and embrace a future where every person counts, everyone has a place, everyone can contribute. You see, despite what Donald Trump may think, most Americans really believe we can do better. Most Americans really believe women should be respected.', 'Most Americans really believe that workers should be paid fairly. Most Americans be-lieve that the United States should work with our allies to lead the world and keep us safe.', 'The energy we are seeing in the final weeks of this campaign is about more than winning an election. It is about standing up to the kind of country that we want for ourselves and our children. And it is about the kind of lessons we want to teach our sons and daughters. I want you to know, if Tim and I are fortunate enough to be your president and vice president, we will work with everyone.', 'Now I imagine here in allegheny county and if you are from further west, you probably know people who are thinking about voting for Donald Trump. And here is what I want you to tell them. I want you to tell them that I understand that they need a president who cares about them, will listen to them, and I want to be their president, too.', 'Because whether you agree or disagree with me, whether you vote for me or vote against me, I believe we can disagree without being disagreeable. I have seen that. I know it can happen. And I know there are a lot of people here in Pennsylvania who have a lot of questions. They want to know, how do we move forward better. They want to know about their town where there used to be a lot of jobs and there are not as many any more. They are upset what they see around them. I get that. But anger is not a plan.', ""And we need -- we need to work together. We need plans that will help us deal with the legitimate concerns and questions that people have in Pennsylvania. I think that is what our whole country needs right now. That's what I will try to do. I am not going to pretend that we can snap our fingers and solve our problems. That does not happen in the real world. But I know we can make progress together. The choice we face in this election is stark, especially when it comes to the economy."", ""Tim and I believe when the middle class thrives, America thrives. And when we invest in working families, in the middle class, in small businesses, we can make the economy work again for everybody. I think it is fair to say that both Donald Trump and Pat Toomey have a different perspective. They believe -- and they believe this -- if you give trillions of dollars -- and they mean trillion with a t -- of tax cuts to millionaires, billionaires, corporations, it will all trickle down to everybody else. It has not worked before and it has caused us a lot of messes we have had to clean up, and I have been privileged to see presidents up close and personal -- right. Married to one, that's right. Worked for one."", 'And here is what I know. That when you focus on helping the middle class, you end up lifting everybody. When you focus on helping the top, you help the top. That is not good enough. Donald likes to say he is on the side of American workers, but his actions tell a different story. Yes, he has bought cheap Chinese steel and aluminum for his construction projects. He should be buying good American-made steel that supports good American jobs.', ""I would like to hear Donald explain to American steelworkers filing for unemployment why he put Chinese steel workers to work, instead of steelworkers here in Pennsylvania. And for all his talk about putting America first, he has made many of his products in 12 different countries. So if he wants to make America great again, why doesn't he start by making things in America? And we now know -- we now know he hasn't paid a dime in federal income taxes for years. He says that makes him smart. Well, I don't know how smart you have to be to lose a billion dollars in a year in the first place. Especially -- answer me this -- how do you lose a billion dollars when you are in the casino business?"", 'Never could figure that out. But what it means is that every one of us is paying more in federal income taxes than a billionaire has. That is wrong and we will end of those kinds of loopholes and gimmicks.', ""I will tell you what. It also means Donald has contributed zero -- zero for our military, zero for our vets, zero for pell grants to help young people go to college, zero for our highways, zero for everything. And yet he stands up on stage and criticizes America. Well it's unfair and it's wrong. With your help, we will make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II, jobs in infrastructure. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our water systems all need help, and those are a lot of good jobs waiting to be done, jobs that can't be exported out of Pennsylvania."", 'I believe we can bring advanced manufacturing back to the United States. That is why we will invest $10 billion in a make it in America partnerships that brings together workers and unions and businesses, universities, and community colleges.', 'Some countries are going to take the lead with precision machineries. Some countries is going to take the lead with 3-d printing. We invented both of those technologies. We should take the lead and we should have the jobs.', ""We are also going to fight climate change with clean, renewable energy jobs. And we are going to help small businesses which will create two thirds of all of the new jobs in America. And we are going to defend your right to organize and bargain collectively for higher wages and benefits. Don't let anybody fool you, my friends. assault on worker rights and unions is an assault on the middle class."", 'It is time to say loudly and clearly, right to work is wrong for workers and wrong for America.', ""So, I have set some big goals. I am excited about what we are going to do. And it's all going to put people to work right here. And sometimes folks say to me, how are you going to get that done? You go to the congress —well first of all, I hope we will elect some or democrats. That will be job number one. Number two, I think it will be a very simple question. Our members of congress, members of the senate going to be on the side of the rich, the powerful, and the wealthy, or on your side? And you know what? They are going to have to answer that question. Because if they stay beholden to the special interest, if they continue to do the bidding of the lobbyist and lawyers and others who stand outside their doors -- I have been in the senate. I have seen it. I know it. If they are going to continue to do the work of those who are already privileged in America, then I want to make sure that they don't come back to Washington after the next election."", 'We are in a great, great high school here, and I am so proud to be here.', 'And so, we are going to be a good partner with education, especially with educators. We are going to start with universal pre-k. We want good schools with good teachers in every zip code so every kid gets a world-class education.', 'And I want us to bring technical education back to high school. I think it was a mistake when we took it out.', ""There are a lot of good jobs that you can be prepared for in today's economy -- coming out of high school, maybe going to community college, going into an apprenticeship program, and I want to lift up that work. A four-year college degree should not be and is not the only way to have a good job with the rising income and a satisfying life."", 'We are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year. And we are going to help you pay down your college debt.', ""It's going to be great. To help you pay it back as a percentage of your income at your job, so you are never on the hook for more than you can afford. I worked on this with Senator Bernie Sanders, and it's going to help save -- it's going to help save people thousands of dollars."", 'In fact after a year, maybe after you are here -- you can go to hillaryclin-ton.com/calculator to see how much your family can save. We want you to know we are going to deliver results for you.', ""I mean, ultimately it's pretty simple. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody and I want everybody to have your chance to get your piece of the American dream."", ""So, there's a lot of work we are going to be doing. We need to raise the national mini-mum wage. People who work full-time should not be mired in poverty. We are, as Tim said, going to guarantee equal pay for women. You know, look, it's not just a woman's issue. If you have a mother, which all of us do -- if you have a mother, a wife, a daughter, or a sister who's working, it's your issue. It's good for the entire family, it's good for our economy."", ""So my friends, there is a lot for us to do in the next 17 days. Because we have got to get the word out. We have got to tell everybody what we are doing and why this election is so critically important. And that's where all of you come in. If you do know people who are thinking about voting for our opponent."", 'Audience Member: Nope!', 'Secretary Clinton: Well, you may. You know, I hope you will stage an intervention.', 'And I do hope you will talk about, you know, the reality versus the demagoguery of what we have seen in this campaign.', ""You know, we need to come together around all of the issues that are important to everybody and as I said in the beginning, whatever issue you care about, it's going to be on the ballot. I care a lot about making sure that women and girls are treated with dignity and respect that they deserve in our country."", 'I care a lot about making sure that we save social security and we ensure that everybody has the benefits that they need in order to be able to live a decent life in retirement.', 'And, boy, do I care a lot about our constitution.', ""And maybe it's because on your behalf I went to 112 countries as your secretary of state. And I met a lot of people who in the us because we have been so steady and so committed to our constitutional system and our values. And what I hope is that you care as deeply as our founders did, as our parents and grandparents did, because maybe they came from somewhere else where they weren't treated right. Maybe they saw firsthand what it meant to be deprived of the rule of law."", ""You know, every time Donald Trump says he wants to jail his opponent, meaning me, I think to myself, you know, we don't do that in America. We actually have laws and courts and an independent judiciary."", 'Or, you know, when he blows up at a journalist or criticizes the press and goes on and on and on.', ""You know, I get criticized by the press. I know that is part of our democratic system. We believe in a free press. And boy, if you go to countries where there isn't one, you will understand why that is so important."", 'And when he says there should be a religious test -- a religious test for people at our borders, a country founded on religious freedom. You have to ask yourself, who is going to conduct the test? Are we going to get a quiz? What if the border security official does not believe you? Who gets to decide whether you get to come in or out based on your religion?', ""And if you haven't seen it yet, I hope you will go and look at the extraordinary statement by Mr. Khan on Youtube in a new video that we have put out. You remember, he pulled out a constitution at our convention. And he reveres our constitution. And for good reason. Because he, too, came from a place where the was no rule of law to speak of."", ""So, whatever issue you care about, this is an issue that will be decided by this election, and that is why I'm reaching out to republicans, democrats, independents, everyone. I know if we bring our talent, our energy, and our ambition to the work of building our country, we are going to see the best days of America ahead of us, and when your chil-dren and your grandchildren ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, I hope you will say you voted for a better America."", ""So, here we go.

He believed in the kind of future he could get through his hard work. That is what I want everybody in our country to believe again.

73,            Hillary Clinton          ,"October 24, 2016","[""Thank you – Wow! Well, I don't know about you, but I could listen to Elizabeth Warren go on all day! It is so great to be back here in New Hampshire! I have a significant unruly group of women I went to Wellesley with back here.\n"", ""Oh, it is so wonderful to be here on this college campus, and to see so many young people here as Maggie and Elizabeth and I were walking up to the stage. And a lot of people were hanging out of the windows, and we're glad that you've got the best view of what we're doing here.\n"", ""It's also exciting to be here with two weeks left because this is the most consequential election of our lifetime, and to see the energy and enthusiasm that this crowd displayed – I saw it yesterday in North Carolina, I saw it the day before in Ohio, it really does demonstrate that Americans are really looking at what's at stake and are coming to the conclusion that we all have to be involved in the remaining days of the campaign. And that everyone needs to turn out to vote.\n"", ""In New Hampshire, you have a lot of reasons to vote – you've got great candidates for Congress, Annie Kuster and Carol Shea Porter, who deserve your support, and you've got a great candidate for governor, Colin Van Ostern, thank you!\n"", ""I know that Maggie, and Elizabeth and I have been out here giving the full dose, but I hope that you will know what is at stake in the governor's race, and in sending these two extraordinary women to the House, and boy, it is exciting to be here with Maggie and Elizabeth because they are people who fight for you every single day. I know these women, and it is a privilege to be on this stage with them.\n"", 'Now, Elizabeth Warren has a track record of making it her mission to stand up against Wall Street. And she is going to make sure that Wall Street never wrecks Main Street again!\n', ""But you may not know that she was the person behind setting up the agency that protects consumers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and it was set up to stand against and to do something about the kinds of fraud and abuse we've seen from Wells Fargo. And they are on the front lines of returning billions of dollars to Americans who have been cheated and defrauded by big companies, by banks and others.\n"", 'In fact, I think it is fair to say some of the best TV that you can see is on C-SPAN when Elizabeth is going after a bank executive or regulator. She is refusing— refusing to let them off the hook, and she is not just speaking for herself, is she? She is speaking for every single American who is frustrated and fed up. And I am so looking forward to working with her to rewrite the rules of our economy to make sure we both grow it and make it fairer for every single person working hard here in America.\n', ""I know we are up here without our phones so we cannot check tweets but – I kind of expect if Donald heard what she just said, he is tweeting away. She gets under his thin skin like nobody else. Whether she is calling him out of his mysterious tax returns, she exposes him for what he is – temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the United States. And Maggie is going to be a great United States senator for New Hampshire. You do not have to take my word or Elizabeth's word. Look at what she has already done. Under Maggie's leadership, New Hampshire has the lowest unemployment rate in the entire country.\n"", 'During her governorship, it was ranked as the best state in the country for business, and she has done it the New Hampshire way. She has brought people together, Democrats and Republicans, and Independents, and I think she has the biggest legislature, probably in the world, that she has to deal with. So she has really honed her skills – listening and trying to work with people, and she has taken issues that do keep families up at night. From the sky rocketing costs of college and prescription drugs , to helping students to figure out ways to afford to get their education to helping those suffering from addiction or mental health, to raising wages for hard working families. What I love about Maggie is that she is independent, she knows how to find common ground, and how to stand her ground. And that is exactly the kind of leader we need in the United States Senate.\n', ""Because we've got to break through the gridlock and dysfunction that has unfortunately marred Washington. We have to get back to listening respectfully. We can disagree without being disagreeable. And that is why we need leaders like Maggie, and unlike her opponent, she has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.\n"", 'She knows he should not be a role model for our kids or anybody else for that matter. So I hope in these next 14 days, you do everything you can to support her. And I want to say a word about Colin, who I have also known for a number of years now. And Maggie is leaving some big shoes. She does not look like it, but she is, she is leaving some big shoes to fill as governor. Colin is the person for that job. You know as a member of Executive Council, and I remember this because it took a lot of guts.\n', ""He helped lead the fight for funding Planned Parenthood in New Hampshire. Against his opponent by the way, and he has showed that he will stand up for women's health 100 percent of the time, not just when it is politically convenient. He also worked with Maggie to cross party lines to help expand Medicaid to more than 50,000 granted stators.\n"", ""And Colin wants to do more to invest clean energy like wind and solar to hold down energy costs to create more good jobs here in New Hampshire and to protect the beautiful environment of this state. And he will fight to put into action the promise of higher education within reach for more families. So please during these next days, make sure you're doing everything you can for Colin, for Carol, and for Annie.\n"", ""Now did anybody see the last debate? I stood next to Donald Trump in three debates for four and a half hours proving once again, I have the stamina to be president. I've tried to use the time I had in all three to talk about what people talk to me about, starting here in New Hampshire and going across the country, because I take it really seriously.\n"", 'I think that the problems that keep you up tonight, that stand in the way of your getting ahead and staying ahead, of providing the best opportunity of a good middle class job with a rising income for you and your kids, those are the problems that someone running for president should actually listen to, pay attention to and come up with solutions for.\n', ""So, you know, I do have a lot of plans, I do. And I get criticized for having so many plans. Tim Kaine and I have actually written a book – oh, there's one copy right there! It's called – oh, another copy! It's called 'Stronger Together,' and we lay out all of our plans for what we want to do if we're so honored as to be president and vice president. And, you know, I do have this old-fashioned idea that if I'm here asking for your vote to be your president, I should tell you what I'm going to do, and maybe, as I said yesterday in North Carolina, maybe it's a bit of a women's thing because we make lists. We do, we make lists and we try to write down what we're supposed to do and then cross them off as we go through the day and the week. And so, I want you think about our plans are as our lists – our lists as a country.\n"", ""We are going to get our economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. We are going to make college affordable. We are going to lower prescription drug costs, and we're going to do everything we can to keep faith with what we have said we're going to do. What a novel idea! We're actually going to try to deliver results for you.\n"", ""But I got to tell you. During that debate, Donald said something. Well, he said a lot of things that were troubling, but he said something truly horrifying. He became the first person running for president – Republican or Democrat – who refused to say that he would respect the results of this election. Now, that is a direct threat to our democracy. I'm not going to try to call it anything else because that's what it is. All this talk about the election being rigged, trying to stir up people who are supporting him at his rallies, that is a direct threat to our democracy. And I got to tell you – as your secretary of state, I went to 112 countries and I went to countries where people were jailed for being political opponents, where they were exiled, where they were killed. I take this really seriously.\n"", ""And for me, the peaceful transfer of power is one of the things that makes our country great – something that – something we can't lose, something we shouldn't even doubt. We cannot give in to cynicism, and I don't think we are. I'll tell you what's exciting to me is across this country, at the very moment Donald Trump is making this unprecedented attack on our fundamental values, our institutions, millions of people are standing up for democracy, registering, volunteering, voting early.\n"", ""So when you get a little discouraged or you get frustrated by what you see in this campaign, think of this: we have just reached a historic milestone. More than 200 million Americans are now registered to vote. And most exciting, that includes more than 50 million young people, the biggest number ever. Now you only see numbers like this when people are standing up for what they believe in and I'm proud to see Americans coming together – Democrats, Republicans and Independents – to reject hate and division. And we're seeing that in New Hampshire, too.\n"", ""We are more than our disagreements, we Americans. There is so much more that unites us than divides us. I'm proud to have the support of more than 150 Republican leaders in this state who put country before party. But this energy we're seeing is not just because of what we're against, as important as that is, it's because what we're for. It's about fighting for a future where everyone counts, where everyone has a place, and no one is left out or left behind.\n"", ""Because to me, and I hope to you as well, this is about more than winning an election, it's about the kind of country we want for our kids and our grandkids. That's what this has to be about. It's about the lessons we want to pass on to our sons and our daughters. You know, we believe we should honor the men and women who fight for our country and that America is safer when we work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence. Yet my opponent attacked a grieving Gold Star family whose son died in Iraq. He has no plan to defeat ISIS. And just last night he tweeted that the new effort underway to push the terrorists out of the key city of Mosul is already, and I quote, 'a total disaster.' And that our country is, quote, 'looking so dumb.' Imagine, imagine, this is a guy who says he knows more about ISIS than the generals. I don't think so. He's basically declaring defeat before the battle has even started. He's proving to the world what it means to have an unqualified commander in chief. It's not only wrong, it's dangerous, and it needs to be repudiated on November the 8th here in New Hampshire and across America.\n"", ""But just in case you think that this is new for Donald, it shouldn't surprise you or anybody else, and I'll tell you why. He has been denigrating America for decades. It started before he campaigned against me. It started before President Obama took office. In fact, back in 1987, he spent $100,000 on an ad in The New York Times criticizing President Reagan. He said, and I quote, 'The world is laughing at America.' Does that sound familiar? This is someone who roots for failure and takes glee in mocking our country no matter who our president is. Now that may be who Donald Trump is, but this election is about who we are. And I want us – I want us to remember, America is great because America is good, right? And as our wonderful First Lady Michelle Obama said right here in New Hampshire, 'When they go, we go high.'\n"", ""This election poses a very clear choice on the economy. When the middle class thrives, America thrives. As Elizabeth said, she is a perfect example of how that works in America. So am I. So are every one of you here. That's what I want for every single person, especially young person, in America. With your help, we're going to not only have Elizabeth back in the Senate, but send Maggie, send Carol, send Annie and then make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.\n"", ""What does that mean? That means jobs in infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our mass transit, our water systems. There is a lot of great work to be done here. And guess what? Those are jobs that can't be exported. They've got to be done, right here in New Hampshire and across America. I want us to invest in advanced manufacturing, and there are, I know, a lot of skeptics about that. They say, 'Well, we can't compete in manufacturing anymore.' Well, I'll tell you what. I don't want us competing with low wage jobs. I want us competing for the high wage jobs. Germany is a major exporter of advanced manufacturing products. I want to compete with Germany and countries like that, precision, machining, 3D printing.\n"", ""I want us to invest more in technology, innovation and research and yes, in clean energy, because we're going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. I think we can deploy a half a billion more solar panels within the first four years and enough clean energy to power every home by the end of 10 years. That's what I want people to be working on and thinking about and striving to achieve.\n"", ""And I am really excited about what we can do to make sure every young American is prepared. I want to start in the early years of life in early education, universal pre-K. I want kids to be prepared to succeed. Because we are in a competition, and you know what? I want us to step up and compete and win. And I want our schools – I want kids to have good teachers and good schools in every zip code, and I want to be a good partner with our teachers and our educators here in New Hampshire. And I want to bring back technical education to high school. I think we really – we really shut the door on too many young people who could've gotten skills that would've given them the chance to get ahead.\n"", ""And working with our community colleges, we need to make sure that every young person and every person coming back to upgrade or change skills can go to a community college. And yes, we are going to make four-year college affordable. Just this week, a new report came out showing that New Hampshire students have very high levels of debt, and I know Maggie has been fighting that. And she's had a moratorium, and she's done what she could at the state level. But we got to work together at the national level to make this happen for students in New Hampshire, families in New Hampshire.\n"", ""So after our primary was over – and you know what, I was really proud – I was really proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. And it was a campaign – it was a campaign about ideas, not insults. And that's what campaigns should be about. And after it was over, Bernie and I got together. We put our heads together. And we came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year. And if you make more than that, it will be debt free. In other words, pay what you can, but let's not have kids and families going into debt to get an education. This should be an investment that we make on behalf of them and our country's future. And no matter where you go, to a great school like this, or anywhere else, we will help you pay down your student debt. We will make is easier, because we a re going to make it as a percentage of you income, so you will never be on the hook for more than you can afford. And if your interested to see how much you and your family can save, you can actually go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator to see how much you can save under this plan that we are proposing.\n"", 'Now, I think in addition to growing the economy, we need to do a lot more on small business. Two-thirds of new jobs will come from small business so we are going to be just focused on how we are going to be able to start and grow your small business. And then we do have to make the economy fairer, and that starts with raising the national minimum wage, because if you work full time, I am talking about full time workers, you should not still be in poverty at the end. Work should provide a ladder of opportunity for people willing to work for it to climb. Right?\n', 'We are going to guarantee equal pay, we are going to make affordable child care so nobody pays more than 10 percent of your income for childcare. We are going to work for paid family leave. Because this is the way families are today. We are not living in the 1950s. Families are under new stresses and strains, and I meet so many who are really just at the edge. They are making all they can make. One parent working full-time, two parents working full-time, sometimes part-time on top of full-time.\n', ""The other day, Tim Kaine and I were in Pittsburgh. There was a long line of people, big overflow, which we couldn't get into the main room where we were. So, Tim was talking to the families there, and there was a woman holding her three-year-old child, a daughter, I think. Tim was shaking hands, and the woman looked and she said, 'I came here hoping that I could tell you or Secretary Clinton that I had my baby three years ago, and the day after, I had my baby, I was fired because I called and ask if I could have a few weeks because it had been a difficult pregnancy. But my baby was fine but not all that she needed to be. I got fired.' And Tim came in, and he is such a wonderful man. What a fine human being. And he said, 'To be there are the reasons everyday why I get so motivated in this election, and I just have another reason.' He told me that story. I think your president should care about that. I think your president should wake up everyday thinking, 'Okay, how do I help empower the most people to make the most out of their own lives, how to break down the barriers that give you the chance to go as far as your hard work and talent will take you?' Sometimes people say, 'How are you going to get all this done?' I have proposed plans that do not add a penny to the debt because I see some of my long time friends who back in the 1992 campaign – where my husband ended up, we had a balance budget and a surplus, and actually, we were on the way to paying down the national debt, but here is what happened.\n"", ""What happened is trickle-down economics came back. So here is what I am going to do. We are going to ask the wealthy to finally pay their fair share. We are going to – we are going to close the loopholes, we are going to end the fact that millionaires can pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer. We are going to make big banks pay for the risks they pose to our economy because Elizabeth is absolutely right. No – no bank is too big to fail, and no one should be above the law, and we are going to enforce that and contrast that with Donald Trump. He believes that if you give trillions and that is trillions with a 't' in tax cuts to the wealthy millionaires and billionaires and corporations, and everything will work out.\n"", ""Well, it will for him. That is trickle down economics on steroids. And he would wipe away the tough new rules that President Obama imposed on Wall Street. He would eliminate the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau that Elizabeth did so much to create. And you know that was bad enough, but then in the debates, we learned he hasn't paid any income tax for years. So he hasn't paid a penny to support our military, our veterans, Pell grants for kids to get an education, health or anything else. And his explanation was he lost a billion dollars in a year. Now, I've pondered this. I've really pondered this. He actually said it made him smart not to pay income taxes, but how smart are you to lose a billion dollars in a year?\n"", ""Has anyone here been to a casino? He lost a billion dollars running casinos. Who does that? I've never heard of anybody. So, we've got to make it clear that Donald is not on the side of America workers or American families. For all of his talk about putting America first, he makes his products in at least 12 other countries. He stiffs small businesses, mom and pop contractors who work for him. My dad was a small business owner. He worked really hard. I'm just glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump because it was hard work, and people who do that work should be rewarded, not taken advantage of.\n"", ""So we know a lot about how Donald Trump works, and today, today, we heard yet another story. It's about a maintenance worker at one of his golf courses. This maintenance courses told his co-workers he was gay, and they started harassing him. They used anti-gay slurs to his face, they threw rocks and golf balls at him, his supervisor saw it and did nothing, and it got so bad, he wound up in the hospital. Finally, he went to the police for help. He couldn't go back to work because he was too scared for his safety, and then he was fired by Trump's golf club. Now, this is a heart-wrenching story on a lot of levels. For starters, it's a painful reminder of the harassment, violence, and discrimination that too many LGBT Americans still face every day. And it is deeply disturbing that instead of stepping in to stop the tormentors, Trump's golf club turned on the victim for coming forward. If that's how Donald Trump runs his business, what does that say about how he would run our country?\n"", ""So my friends, there are lots of reasons, so many, to take this election seriously. But here's what I want you to know: of course, I want you to vote for all of us, but more than that, I want you to vote for yourselves, and for your families, and for your hope for our future together. Because if you believe women and girls should be treated with dignity and respect and women should be able to make our own health care decisions, and marriage equality should be protected, and that we have to take on the epidemic of substance abuse, disorders, and addiction. If you believe in a foreign policy where we work with our allies, not insult them, and achieve common goals towards peace and prosperity, then you have to vote. All of these issues are on the ballot this November, and I believe with all of my heart, that we will after this election, get together to help heal the divides that have sprung up and are so painful among us.\n"", ""So please register and vote on the same day. Go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place. Come help us these last two weeks. Go to hillaryclinton.com, sign up to volunteer, take out your phone, text 'JOIN,' J-O-I-N to 47246 and get everybody you know to come out and vote.

I'm going to work as hard as I can between now and the close of the election that's two weeks from today.\n"", ""And you know, it's so important for Florida. There are so many issues that we need to remind people about. Last time I was here, I campaigned with Al Gore and he said a lot about the climate crisis. And you know why? Because we're seeing the reality of climate change every day in Florida. We are seeing areas in Miami even on sunny days without a drop of rain where the streets are flooding. And the ocean is rising.\n"", ""And what we've got to do is make sure that this issue -- fighting climate change, creating clean renewable energy jobs -- stays at the top of the priorities, and that's why you need a new senator like Patrick Murphy.\n"", 'I have to say, nobody should want to wake up on November 9th and wonder whether there was more you could have done. I hope you will wake up on November 9th proud that you took a stand and voted for an America that belongs to all of us, where we set big goals and we work together to achieve them.\n', 'I got to tell you, I believe America is great because America is good.\n', ""And I want to tell you one other thing. I want to say one other thing that's really very important to me. We should honor the men and women in uniform who fight for our country.\n"", 'That\'s why I was so appalled when Donald Trump tweeted that the new effort underway to push the terrorists out of the key city of Mosul is already, and I quote him, ""a total disaster"" and that our country is, again a quote, ""looking dumb."" Really? He\'s declaring defeat before the battle has even started. He\'s proving once again he is unqualified to be commander in chief of our military.\n', 'Here\'s another example. He was asked if he would defend our allies. He said well, first he\'d want to know if they made any payments to us to defend them. And when asked specifically about Israel, he said, and I quote again, he would ""love to be neutral.""\n', ""Now, we can't have a president who says he's neutral on Monday, pro-Israel on Tuesday, and who knows what on Wednesday, because in his mind, everything is negotiable.\n"", 'I have a different view.

And with your help, we're going to make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II -- jobs in infra-structure and advanced manufacturing, and clean renewable energy, and small busi-nesses. I want us to make America the clean energy super power of the 21st century.\n"", ""We can create millions of jobs and protect our planet at the same time. And I've got to say no state, no state should care more about this issue than Florida. Right? And you know, I'll tell you something that it's kind of sad, to be honest with you. I've traveled all over the country. And in New Jersey and Massachusetts, they have more solar power than the Sunshine State.\n"", ""Why? Well, because you have a governor and a legislature who, like your current senator, doesn't want to believe the science of climate change; doesn't see the opportunity that Florida has to be literally the global leader in clean energy.\n"", 'And so I want to deploy a half-billion more solar panels by the end of my first term, and enough clean energy to power every home in America within 10 years.\n', ""And we're also going to strengthen education at every level, starting with universal pre-K, and working -- working with our teachers to make sure every child has a good school with good teachers in every zip code. And here's what I want all the students to hear, we're going to make college more affordable for everyone.\n"", 'You know, after our primary, which was hard-fought, and I was proud of the primary we ran because it was about issues. Senator Sanders and I got together, came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for any families making less than $125,000 a year.\n', ""That's the vast majority of families. And if you're over that, we're going to make it debt-free. So pay what you can afford. But I don't want to see young people and their families going into debt. I view this as an investment. And that's why we're going to make it easier for you to afford to pay back your college debt -- pay it down and pay it off.\n"", ""And I also want more pathways to good jobs that don't require a four-year college de-gree. Let's return technical education to high schools. Let's do more with our community colleges. Let's have more apprenticeship programs so that everybody has a chance at a good job.\n"", ""And you know, in addition -- in addition to making the economy grow and making sure people are ready with the skills to do these jobs, I want to make it fairer. That's why I want to raise the national minimum wage. If you work full-time, you shouldn't still be in poverty. And don't you think it is finally maybe past time to guarantee equal pay for women's work?\n"", ""And, you know, I always tell crowds, this is not a women's issue. It's a family issue. If you have a wife, a mother, a sister or a daughter working, it's your issue. And that's why we have got to get this fixed once and for all.\n"", ""And let's make childcare affordable. And let's have more profit sharing. And let's do the kinds of things that will lift everybody up. Now, you know, when I talk about raising equal pay for women as one of my primary issues, you know, Donald Trump or somebody always says, well, there she goes playing the woman card. And I've got to tell you, I don't believe that's what it is. I think we're paying -- playing the smart card.\n"", ""Because we want everybody's incomes to go up. That's how we're going to get this economy really moving forward, creating new jobs. And so if that's playing the woman card, you know what we say, deal me in.\n"", ""I've also said I will pledge not to do anything that would raise taxes on people making less than $250,000 a year, because we don't need to do that. We can go where the money is, the millionaires and the billionaires, the corporations, to make them pay their fair share to support the kind of growth that we need in our economy.\n"", ""We're going to close the loopholes and make sure no multi- millionaire can get away with paying a lower rate than a nurse or a police officer or a teacher.\n"", ""Now remember when we learned in one of the debates that Donald Trump hadn't paid any federal taxes?\n"", ""For about 20 years is the best guess we've got, and his excuse, I love his excuse, his excuse was well, he lost $1 billion in a year.\n"", ""I've been really pondering this. How does anybody lose $1 billion in a year, especially when you're running casinos? Think about it. Has anybody here ever been to a casino?\n"", 'Audience: Yes!\n', ""Clinton: Well, you know, usually they say the house wins, so Donald Trump said it was smart for him to avoid paying taxes. Well, if losing $1 billion is smart, I think that's kind of upside down and backwards. I think people should be working hard to make their incomes, to support their families, and that's what we're going to do because we don't want the kind of values that Donald Trump used in running his business to be in our government.\n"", ""He stiffs -- he stiffs small businesses. My dad was a small business owner. Donald Trump has refused to pay all kinds of folks, workers, small businesses installing drapes or marble or glass, or where he bought pianos, he didn't pay them. He just doesn't pay them and he gets away with it because he turns and he says to these small businesses well, go ahead and sue me.\n"", ""Well, my dad, because he was a small business man, I know he could never have afforded that, so I'm just glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump, because our family would have been hurt by that.\n"", ""So here's the bottom line and here's what I need you to do. We have got to get everybody you know to turn out and vote, and you have early voting now and it's going to be much easier for some of you to vote early.

Pay no attention to the polls. Don't get -- don't get complacent, because we've got to turn people out.\n"", ""So I'm asking you to vote for me, I'm asking you to send Patrick Murphy to the Senate, I'm asking you most importantly to vote for yourselves, because really, that's what is at stake.

75,            Hillary Clinton          ,"October 26, 2016","['Thank you so much! Thank you. Wow, thank you all. What a great way to celebrate my birthday being here in Tampa!\n', ""I am so, so grateful to José for that wonderful introduction. He's an incredibly talented chef, but more than that, I have to say he's a humanitarian. He just came back from Haiti, once again, where he goes periodically to help feed people. He's been doing it ever since the terrible earthquake, going to help people in remote villages – and he does that all over the world when it comes to making sure that there are clean cookstoves so that people can cook, primarily women and children, without fear of getting sick from inhaling all the smoke. I enlisted José's help when I was Secretary of State on the clean cookstoves initiative. And as you heard, he's also a proud immigrant and – he is standing up to Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, and he's doing it in a very courageous way because he sacrificed his business. He'd been asked by the Trump Organization to put a restaurant into the new hotel that Trump was talking about on TV today, in Washington, and after José heard the kinds of things that Donald Trump was saying about immigrants, he said, 'No, I refuse to open a restaurant in that hotel.' That is really gutsy.\n"", 'And today was a perfect time to have José be with us because, as I said, Donald Trump is taking time off the campaign trail to officially open the hotel. And yesterday, here in Florida, he took time out to invite the press to listen to his employees talk about what a great boss he is while he was watching and listening to them.\n', ""And today, in opening that hotel, I think it's important to note that he once again relied on undocumented workers. The same people he has been insulting and demonizing throughout this campaign. So, like with so much else that Donald Trump says, he says one thing and then he does something different. Many of the products in the hotel were made overseas rather than here in the United States, and he even sued the District of Columbia to pay lower taxes. That is the way that he does business.\n"", ""Now, we've actually learned in this campaign that Donald Trump is the poster boy for everything wrong with our economy. He refuses to pay workers and contractors from Atlantic City to Miami to Las Vegas. He stiffs small businesses. I take that one personally because my dad was a small businessman. And I've met so many people who did projects for Donald Trump – provided pianos for one of his casinos, installed drapes for one of his hotels, laid the marble, put in the glass, washed the dishes, painted – and then weren't paid. I just think that is fundamentally wrong and that is not the kind of experience we need in the Oval Office.\n"", ""So I'm grateful to José and I want to thank everyone else – my great friend, your United States Senator Bill Nelson. Congresswoman Kathy Castor. Mayor Bob Buckhorn, who's here with his two daughters. Governor Charlie Crist, soon to be Congressman Charlie Crist. I have to say, we've got two great candidates here: David Singer, candidate for the House of Representatives; and Rena Frazier, another candidate. And we have the great talent of Angela Bassett with us today.\n"", ""So, my friends, here's the advice that I got. It is a beautiful day in Tampa, but it's warm. And some of you have been here a while, right? And I'm watching the flags. So long as they're waving, I know there's a breeze. If they stop waving, I'm really going to cut this short.\n"", 'But let me start by thanking you – thanking you for being here.\n', '[Chants of ""Hillary!""]\n', ""Thank you. Thank you. Well, I'll tell you, if I ever need a pickup, I'm coming back to Tampa, Mayor. And with 13 days left in this election, we cannot stop for a minute. No complacency here. Nobody— nobody flagging. We've got to get everybody out to vote. And I hope in addition to the people that I've mentioned, someone who's not here I hope you will support – that is Congressman Patrick Murphy, to send him to the United States Senate.\n"", ""I think you'll be pleased because he's an independent voice. He's a problem-solver. He believes in comprehensive immigration reform. He has stood with Planned Parenthood against the attacks that it has suffered. He has even brought Democrats and Republicans together to try to protect our environment and fund Everglades restoration. He'll stand up to the gun lobby and advocate for common sense gun safety measures. He'll defend Social Security and Medicare, not cutting or privatizing those two essential programs. So please, do your best to make sure we send Patrick Murphy to the Senate.\n"", 'Now, I got to ask you, anybody see the last debate? You know, I have now stood next to Donald Trump for four and a half hours, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do the job.\n', ""And every time he says one of those outrageous things that he does have a – yeah, 'Wrong' – he does have a way of saying, I just keep remembering Michelle Obama's words: when he goes low, we go high.\n"", ""But I got to say, he said something in the last debate we've never heard from anybody running for president. He basically said that he's not sure – he refused to say that he would respect the results of the election. Now, this is a guy who said the Emmys were rigged, so you can't really take what he says very seriously. But this is a problem because the first thing a president does at noon on January 20th is to take an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. And if you are casting doubts, you want to keep people in suspense as to whether you will respect the outcome of an election, that is contrary to who we are as Americans. We have our elections; we've had them from George Washington forward. We're going to keep having them and show what a democracy looks like to the rest of the world.\n"", ""I believe strongly that the American people are going to reject this dark, divisive vision of America, and it's happening, my friends. We have reached a milestone. More than 200 million Americans are registered to vote. That's the biggest number ever. And that number includes 50 million young people. And you know what else? More than 10 million people have already voted, including 2 million right here in Florida.\n"", ""I'm hearing some great stories from people. Let me just tell you one. It's about Steven, from St. Augustine. He's been fighting a rare form of leukemia and heart disease. He's been in and out of the hospitals a dozen times in the last two years. But he knows how important his vote is. So I heard yesterday he ditched his oxygen tank, which I would not have recommended – clung to his walker, stood in line so he could cast his vote for a better America. And if Steven can do that, nobody has any excuses. And I think this extends not just to Democrats but to Republicans and independents, and I am proud to have support from Republicans and independents here, across Florida, and across America who agree with me that we should reject hate and division.\n"", ""We have seen Donald Trump insult nearly every person in America, and I just find that so intolerable. Because look at this diverse crowd; look at Tampa. It's a cosmopolitan city. Florida is paving the way for what our country will look like, and we need to be lifting each other up, listening to each other, respecting each other, not sowing seeds of hatred and bigotry. And I think one of my biggest jobs after this election will be bringing our country together, and I'm going to need your help.\n"", ""We're going to get the economy working for everybody, not just people at the top, with new jobs in infrastructure. That rail system, Bob, that you want, we're going to get it because it would help you so much. Think of the people we'd put to work – technology, innovation, research, advanced manufacturing, and yes, small business. I want to be the best small business president you can have, to help people start and grow their businesses. But we're also going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. I know we can create millions of jobs, and we can protect Florida, especially coastal Florida, and we can protect our planet at the same time. You're already seeing the results of climate change here in Florida. I was just in Miami, and they actually have flooding on sunny days with no rain. People are calling 3-1-1 because they think a water main broke, but it's the oceans rising. So I know there is no state that could benefit more from a clean energy agenda than Florida, and that's exactly what we're going to do.\n"", ""We're also going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. If your family makes less than $125,000, which is most families in America, you're not going to have to pay a penny to go to a public college or university. If your family makes more than that, you're not going to have to go into debt – pay what you can afford, and then we're going to make sure you can go without getting a big debt, because that drags people down. And for people who already have debt, we are going to help you refinance it and pay it off.\n"", ""And I want to say something to all of the teachers and educators. I want to work with you and be a good partner with you. And I think there should be more than one way, more than just a four-year college degree, to get a good job with a good middle-class life for you and your families. So let's invest in more technical education in high school, in our community colleges. Let's have more apprenticeship programs – labor and business together.\n"", ""But while we grow the economy, let's make it fairer. We need to raise the national minimum wage so that people who work full-time aren't left in poverty. I got to tell you, I was raised to believe in hard work. My grandfather was a factory worker, my dad had a small business, and we really believed you've got to work for what you get in life, right? But if you're working, you shouldn't be at the point where you cannot even afford food or clothes or rent at the end of the year.\n"", ""And isn't it finally time to guarantee equal pay for women's work? You know, this is not just a women's issue. This is a family issue. If you've got a mother, a wife, a sister, or a daughter working, it's your issue. And unlike my opponent, we're going to ask the wealthy, the millionaires and billionaires, to pay their fair share, because we're going to close the loopholes and make sure no multimillionaire ever pays a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer or a firefighter. And I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year.\n"", ""So when you go to the polls, vote to grow the economy, more jobs with rising incomes, vote to make the economy fairer. And compare that with what my opponent has proposed. He really believes if you give trillions – that's trillions with a 't' – trillions in tax cuts to the wealthy, millionaires, billionaires, big corporations, everything will trickle down. Now, we know that doesn't work; we've seen it. And it's pretty rich coming from a guy who claims to be so rich, who hasn't paid a dime in federal income taxes in 20 years. He says not making taxes makes him smart. Well, I don't know. I don't know how smart you have to be to lose a billion dollars in one year. And besides, what kind of genius loses money running a casino, for heaven's sakes?\n"", ""Actually, it sounds like a few people have been at casinos here. But this means he's contributed zero, okay? He actually has the gall to call our military a disaster. Not only is he wrong, but what right does he have to say that? He hasn't contributed a penny to our military, not a penny to our veterans, not a penny to health care or education, not a penny to highways or infrastructure. This is a false – false – charge that he makes about all the problems in our country.\n"", ""And I'll tell you something; we did a little research. He's been denigrating America for decades. This didn't start with his birther lie against President Obama. It didn't even start running against me. Back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in The New York Times criticizing President Reagan. He said our leaders were the laughing stock of the world. So this is a guy who criticizes everybody but himself. And at some point, you got to say, wait a minute, we're better than that. We are stronger than that. We want to forward – forward – into the future with confidence and optimism, and that's what we're offering in this campaign.\n"", ""I got to tell you, it is not just what we're against that should motivate you to go to the polls; it's what we are for. And I believe strongly that what we're for will make it possible for all of us, and especially our kids and our grandkids, to have the best future. America's best days can still be ahead of us. But we can't make any of this happen if we don't have you voting.\n"", ""Now, Donald Trump says he can still win, and he's right. That's why it's so important everyone gets out and votes.

In south Florida, it goes through Sunday, November 6 around the state.

After this election, if I\'m fortunate enough to be elected, we are going to reach out to everybody. Right? And ask. Ask the people you\'re talking to what kind of change they really want because I don\'t think most Americans want the kind of divisive and dark change Donald Trump is offering: mass deportations that will rip families apart, a repeal of gun-free school zones on day one, going back to the day when insurance companies could discriminate against us if we have a preexisting condition, letting Wall Street write its own rules, denying the science of climate change, rolling back marriage equality, defunding Planned Parenthood, the hugest tax breaks ever for the wealthy, and abroad abandoning our alliances and allowing more countries to get nuclear weapons.""\n', 'Audience: ""No.""\n', 'Clinton: ""Now, that may be change, but, boy, that\'s not the change we need.

And I want to thank our First Lady for her eloquent, powerful defense of that basic value. So I think you're getting the idea here that I think everything we care about is at stake in this election. So you've got to vote – and get your friends and families and neighbors to vote too.\n"", ""And don't just take it from me because I think you've heard some really compelling voices say the same thing, and one of them is here with us today, right? There are so many things I admire about our First Lady. Michelle reminds us to work hard, stay true to our values, be good to one another and never, ever stop fighting for what we believe in.\n"", ""She has spent eight years as our First Lady advocating for girls around the world to go to school and have the same opportunities as boys. She has worked for healthier childhoods for our kids here at home, better nutrition, more exercise. And we are seeing the results. We actually are seeing kids who are healthier, something that she was determined to try to achieve. She has encouraged more young people to go to college and follow your dreams, and she has supported America's military families, who serve and sacrifice as well for our country.\n"", ""Now, it hasn't been all hard work. She played a mean round of 'Carpool Karaoke,' and among the many real privileges I've had is to see the President and the First Lady dance. Wow, one could only hope. Now, she also planted an amazing vegetable garden at the White House – and I can promise you, if I win, I will take good care of it, Michelle.\n"", ""And boy – thank you! Boy, didn't she dazzle the world with that wise and beautiful speech at the Democratic National Convention this summer?\n"", ""And I have now, I have now stood on the debate stage for four and a half hours with Donald Trump, and if you see any of those debates, well, that has proved once and for all that I have the stamina to be President and Commander in Chief. But there were times during those three debates, the loop running in my head was what Michelle said at the convention, right? 'When they go low, we go high.'\n"", 'And on top of all that, just by being herself every day, never missing an opportunity to honor her parents for the hard work and sacrifice that set her on her way, she has shown every little girl and boy in America that there are no limits to what they can achieve if they work hard and do right and believe in themselves.\n', 'Seriously – is there anyone more inspiring than Michelle Obama?\n', ""And maybe, maybe it's especially meaningful to me because I do know something about being First Lady of the United States, and I'm going to state the obvious. It's not easy. You've got so many people counting on you. You've got the eyes of the world on you. And when you're trying to raise your children as she is and I did, and give them the space and support they need to have as normal and safe and fulfilling childhoods as possible – that makes it even harder. I used to hang out in the main hall on the second floor of the White House around the time Chelsea would come home from school just to be sure I got to see her and see what happened that day and try to figure out what I needed to be thinking about and doing for her.\n"", ""And let's be real – as our first African-American First Lady, she's faced pressures I never did. And she's handled them with pure grace. By any standard, she has been an outstanding First Lady who has made us all so proud.\n"", 'And she and the President, she and the President have been such wonderful friends to me and my family. It has just meant the world, the world to me, it really has.\n', ""I want to say just one thing about the First Lady's work. I mentioned military families. She's been their fierce champion. And military families have come up against a lot in this election. It just made me boil when Donald Trump disrespected a Gold Star family, Mr. and Mrs. Khan. He still hasn't apologized to them.\n"", ""He actually made it worse – just yesterday, he said again that if America had only made him President years ago, their son, Captain Khan, would still be alive. Honestly, I don't -- I don't understand how anyone would want to rub salt in the wounds of a grieving family.\n"", ""And he keeps insulting our military. Yesterday, when he heard that a retired Army colonel and former dean of the Army War College said that Donald doesn't understand military strategy, Trump said, 'I'll teach him a couple things.' Well actually, Donald, you're the one who's got a lot to learn about the military and everything else that makes America great. Starting by learning about the dignity and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and their families. And he should learn from Michelle Obama how a leader supports them, not disrespects them!\n"", ""No one knows the stakes in this election better than our First Lady. Because all the progress that we've achieved under President Obama's leadership is at stake – he pulled our economy out of the biggest ditch that it was in when he became president. He saved the auto industry, he cracked down on Wall Street, he has tackled healthcare, climate change, civil rights, and so much else.\n"", ""And all the work that we've done to strengthen our relationships with other countries and secure our leadership in the world is also at stake.\n"", 'Now, I for one, and I hope all of you, do not want all that hard work – by our President and our First Lady and by millions of Americans – to be wiped away. We cannot let that happen.\n', ""We've got to do everything in our power to get everyone out to vote. To understand no matter what issue you care about, it truly is on the ballot. Now, this has been a hard election at times. It's gotten pretty ugly, hasn't it? We've all felt it – especially our kids.\n"", ""I hear this from parents and children across our country – kids write me notes, they hand me little cards and notes when I shake hands with them. Their parents write to me, teachers talk to me. Kids are scared, kids are scared by the rhetoric they're hearing, right? I see the educators' heads nodding.\n"", ""Little girls hear the ugly things that have been said about women in this campaign, and it makes them feel terrible and doubt themselves – and that is why it is important for voices, like our First Lady's, to stand up and say, 'Wait a minute, respecting women and girls is so important,' and it is especially important for us to send that message to our children, boys and girls alike.\n"", ""Our kids are scared that they're going to be sent out of the country because their parents are immigrants or they're immigrants. They're scared if they're Muslim, or have a disability. I got a letter from a parent -- a mom from Wisconsin, I think, who adopted her son Felix from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He just turned 11 years old – he wrote my campaign to let me know he was now 11 years old. I love it when little kids do little birthday remembrances. America is the only country he's ever known. One day, he turned to his mom and asked, 'If Donald Trump becomes President, is he going to make me go back to Ethiopia?'\n"", ""Now that honestly breaks my heart. We've got to make sure all our kids know that America has a place for you -- the American Dream is big enough for you. And then, we've got to make sure they learn the right lessons about how to treat people. I saw that sign, I believe in love and kindness, right?\n"", ""Well, here's one place to start. We know that bullying is a real problem in our classrooms, our playgrounds and online – and teachers have reported that this election has made it worse. So I want you to know, we're going to launch a major new effort to help states and communities and schools and families end bullying wherever it takes places. And we will work together to make the internet a safer space for kids, invest in front-line professionals like guidance counselors and social workers and school nurses and psychologists to support kids who've been targeted, like the young woman I met in Iowa who told me she was bullied because of her asthma. This has got to stop. And I can't think of anything more important than making sure every single one of our kids knows that they loved just as they are.\n"", ""So ultimately, my friends, as Michelle reminded us this election is about our kids, and in my case, my grandkids. Their lives and their futures -- nothing is more important to me than that. I've been fighting for kids throughout my career. I will fight for them every single day of my presidency. So we have a job to do.\n"", ""Starting right now, let's come together. Let's work together. And let's be hopeful and optimistic and unified in the face of division and hate. Bring people together in a spirit of mutual respect to solve shared challenges. Let's have each other's backs, lift each other up, not tear each other down.\n"", ""Let's go out and win this election to make sure we do exactly that – for Roy Cooper, Deborah Ross, and all of us.

It starts with the story of a ribbon-cutting back in 1996 for a nursery school serving children living with HIV and AIDS in New York. Now, let me say, this is important in part to remember. This is a story about children with HIV and AIDS. So there was a big celebration honoring the donors who had supported the nursery school, and all the kids and their families, for whom this was the most important thing you can imagine. Because you know, back in the '90s, some of you remember. Right? Children weren't welcomed in school.\n"", ""And then, unannounced and uninvited, guess who barges in? Donald Trump. He walks right up to the stage. He sat down in the seat that was being saved for a local developer who had made a generous donation. None of the people working for the charity knew why he was there. He wasn't a donor at all. He had never given a single dollar to help build the school. He just wanted people to think he had. So he sat on the stage through the program, even posed for photographs, and when it was over, he got up and walked out. No explanation. No donation. Now really, who does that? What kind of person does that? Really? I mean, who pretends to help kids with HIV and AIDS in order to make themselves look good? Well, I'll tell you: The same kind of person who would pull a bait and switch on a high school chess team.\n"", 'Back in 1997, he was principal for a day at a public school. That was a program we used to have in New York. The chess team was holding a bake sale to raise money to travel to a tournament. They were $5,000 short. He walked up to them and handed them a fake million dollar bill. At first the kids and their parents were excited. Then they were devastated to learn it was a joke. So he gave them 200 bucks and drove away in his limousine. Now, this story does have a happy ending because a woman read the story about Donald Trump\'s behavior, called the school, and donated the $5,000. And the coach remembers this woman saying, ""I am ashamed to be the same species as this man.""\n', ""Now, I got to say, any of you see the debates? Well, you know, I stood next to Donald Trump in three debates for four and a half hours, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do this job. Right? But a lot of what we've heard him say is part of a lifelong pattern. And here's what the Washington Post concludes. 'For as long as he has been rich and famous, he has wanted people to believe he is generous. He spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public, even nationally televised promises, to give his own money away. It was in large part a façade.' And a months-long investigation by the Washington Post found that Trump had sought credit for charity he had not given or had claimed other people's giving as his own.\n"", ""Now, of course, because he's refused to release his tax returns, we don't even know if he's ever given anything. But here's what we do know. With Donald, it's always Donald Trump first and everyone else last. He abuses his power. He games the system, and he doesn't care who's left holding the bag.\n"", ""And here's what else we know. Donald Trump has a terrible record on LGBT rights. And this election will determine whether we continue the progress we've made or let it be ripped away. We know Trump has promised he'll appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn marriage equality and that he will repeal President Obama's executive actions to protect LGBT people from discrimination. And just this week, a new story came out that tells us a lot about how he treats LGBT employees. It's a story of a maintenance worker at one of Trump's golf courses. So I want you just to think.\n"", ""This guy works hard. Works with his hands. Probably there 12 hours a day, maybe more, when it's the summer season. After he told his coworkers he was gay, they started harassing him. They called him names. They even threw rocks and golf balls at him. It got so bad he ended up in the hospital. Now, his supervisor saw all of this and did nothing. So finally he went to the police for help. He was too scared even to come back to work. And what did the Trump golf course do? They fired him.\n"", ""Now, this is a heart-wrenching story on a lot of levels. For starters, it's a painful reminder of the harassment, violence, and discrimination too many LGBT Americans still face every single day. And it's deeply distributing that instead of stepping in to stop this unacceptable behavior, Trump's business punished the victim for coming forward. Now, if that's how Donald Trump runs his business, what does it say about how he would run our country? We've made a lot of progress on LGBT rights, but as that story reminds us, we still have work ahead, don't we?\n"", ""There is still no federal law that stops an employer from refusing to hire someone just because he or she is LGBT, or a landlord from refusing to rent an apartment to a transgender tenant, and of course there are still states where you could get married on Saturday, post your Facebook photos on Sunday, and get fired on Monday just because of who you are and who you love. So here's what I'll do as president. We will call on the Congress to pass the Equality Act. And we will then be able to protect LGBT Americans from discrimination in all aspects of our lives. We'll work together to achieve the AIDS-free generation that is within our reach. And we will take on homelessness, bullying, and violence, particularly youth homelessness, which disproportionately hurts LGBT kids. And we are going to end the harmful practice of so-called conversion therapy. LGBT kids don't need to be cured of anything. They just need to be accepted and embraced and respected. And yes, we're going to bring people together to reform our gun laws and keep guns from falling into the wrong hands so that what happened in Orlando can never happen again.\n"", ""Now, some of you know, Chad Griffin and others know, this issue is really important to me. I traveled to 112 countries as your Secretary of State. I saw how countries around the world treated lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. And I believe with all my heart America has to lead by example. I want – I want LGBT people in every corner of our country – because don't forget you all living in Wilton Manors have moved far away from a lot of the places where people are still scared today.

It's your future. It's who we are as a country. It's every issue we care about. And make no mistake: LGBT rights are at stake. Dignity and respect for every American is at stake. The future of our economy is at stake.\n"", ""I believe when the middle class thrives, Americans thrive. And we're going to make America the clean-energy superpower of the 21st Century, too. And if we're serious about supporting a middle class, we're going to be supporting families.\n"", 'The other day, I was in Pittsburgh. And there was a woman there with her young child. We\'ve got some folks from Pittsburgh. She was shaking Tim Kaine\'s hand. And she said to him, ""I came here hoping I could tell you or Secretary Clinton I had my baby three years ago. And the next day, I was fired. It had been a difficult pregnancy. I called to ask if I could take a little time to recover, and the answer was \'No. Don\'t come back at all.\' Nobody, no parent, should ever have to make that kind of choice, but that\'s also true when we talk about paid family leave, caring for a spouse or a partner, caring for an elderly relative.\n', ""I want us to recognize the way we live today. It is no longer the 1950s. We need to support people who are part of committed relationships, of families, of marriages, and give everybody the support you need to actually do what's the most important thing in life. And that is caring for each other. We're going to do everything we can to catch up to the rest of the world: affordable childcare, paid family leave, earned sick days, jobs with rising incomes. We're going to raise the national minimum wage. No one who works full-time should have to raise a family in poverty.\n"", ""And yes, we're going to guarantee equal pay for women's work. We're going to make sure. We're going to make sure that we not only grow the economy but we make it fairer. And I've got to tell you that's such a stark contrast with Trump. He believes if you give the biggest tax cut in American history to the wealthy – that's with trillions of dollars going to the top – that will somehow trickle down. It hasn't worked. It won't work. I believe that we could grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up. And that's exactly what we're going to do.\n"", ""So, my friends, we've got a guy who won't pay his income tax. I mean, I've got to just say when we learned in the debate that he lost a billion dollars and that meant that he didn't pay income tax for like 20 years, he said that was smart. And I thought to myself, how smart do you have to be to lose a billion dollars? I mean, really. And what kind of genius are you to lose a billion dollars while running casinos? But it's serious because it means he's paid zero, zero for our military, our vets, for healthcare, for Pell Grants, for our universities, our colleges, our highways. This is Trump to a T.\n"", ""The stories that I told you about him showing up and acting like he's done something, well, he shows up and criticizes our country. He shows up and discriminates against African Americans when he was denying them the right to rent apartments. He chose to make his products in other countries, not America. He's built a career on stiffing small businesses. I take that personally. My dad was a small business owner. I'm sure glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump.\n"", ""So, my friends, we've got work to do. And let's get to that work. We've got to make sure that we get everybody out to vote.

79,            Hillary Clinton          ,"October 31, 2016","[""Hello, Kent State! And Happy Halloween everybody! It's great to be back in Ohio – even if, even if the World Series is making life very stressful for Cubs fans everywhere.\n"", 'I want to thank Bruce Blair for that introduction, and for his service to our nation. I think every American should hear your story over the next 8 days before they vote. I also want to thank everyone who was part of the pre-program. In particular, let me thank Senator Sherrod Brown, such a great senator, my dear friend and great congressman Tim Ryan, State Representative John Boccieri, State Representative Kathleen Clyde, and let me thank the Kent Clarks, the acapella group that sang during the pre-program!\n', ""My friends, we are about to enter the final week of this election, so I wanted to come back to Ohio, one of the most competitive and consequential battlegrounds in the country, to talk about what's at stake in this election. But let me start with this. I'm sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go. That's a good question!\n"", ""And first of all, for those of you who are concerned about my using personal email, I understand and as I've said, I'm not making excuses. I said it was a mistake and I regret it and now they apparently want to look at emails of one of my staffers and by all means, they should look at them. And I am sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year. There is no case here. And they said it wasn't even a close call and I think most people have decided a long time ago what they think about all of this.\n"", ""Now what people are focused on is choosing the next President and Commander-in-Chief of the United States of America. And did any of you see the debates? Well, I think it was important because I had a chance to talk about my 30 years of public service and my plans for our country. And then people could weigh that against what my opponent has done and said. I am running against a man who says he doesn't understand why we can't use nuclear weapons. He actually said, 'Then why are we making them?' And he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. Imagine nuclear weapons smack in the middle of the Middle East.\n"", ""And if you're telling yourself he'll surround himself with smart people who'll stop these crazy ideas, remember this: When he asked who he consults on foreign policy, Donald Trump said he didn't need to consult because he said and I quote, 'I have a very good brain.' He said he knows more about ISIS than our generals do. No, he does not. And of course, the people Donald Trump has had around him include two men whose activities are reportedly being investigated for their ties to Russia -- Vladimir Putin and Putin's allies.\n"", ""So, in these last days, let's not get distracted from the real choice in this election and the consequences for your future. I started saying last June, I believe, that Donald Trump has proven himself temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be President and Commander-in-Chief. And I've got to tell you, I did not take any pleasure in saying that. I have known, I have known for years now people who ran for President, Republicans and Democrats. And I had my differences with Republicans and even with Democrats, but I never doubted their fitness to serve. Donald Trump is different. That's as serious as it gets.\n"", 'So today, I want to talk about our national security. Because when the election is over and people wake up on November 9th, we will have picked the person who will carry the responsibility for all these weighty decisions. And that should really convince anyone how high the stakes really are in this election. And I just want to focus on three of the most crucial questions facing the next President: Can you be trusted to command our nuclear arsenal and make literally life and death decisions about war and peace? How do you handle a crisis? And do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries?\n', ""We'll start with nuclear weapons. Now, I know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fear-mongering, but I don't think so and in part of what you just heard from Bruce Blair. When dozens of retired nuclear launch officers publicly state that Donald Trump should, and I quote, 'not have his finger on the button,' then this is a topic that can't be avoided. And as I've said, Donald has repeatedly suggested that more countries should have nuclear weapons. He must not realize or care that the more nuclear material there is in the world, the more likely terrorists are to get their hands on it -- or that someone will miscalculate and start a war that can't be stopped. And when a few more countries go nuclear, their neighbors will feel pressure to do so as well.\n"", ""One of the reasons I worked so hard to impose sanctions on Iran so that we could get them to the negotiating table was so we would not have a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and I am proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear weapons program. But even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesn't seem to bother Donald Trump. 'Good luck, enjoy yourselves, folks,' was what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in Asia.\n"", 'I wonder if he knows that a single nuclear warhead can kill millions of people. These are weapons today far more powerful than the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.\n', ""To talk so casually, so cavalierly about mass annihilation is truly appalling. President Ronald Reagan once said -- and he worked hard for arms control and I admired what he did working with the Soviet Union -- and he once said he feared, and this is a quote from President Reagan, 'some fool or some maniac or some accident triggering the kind of war that is the end of the line for all of us.' That has been the fear and the commitment of Democratic and Republican presidents since the dawn of the Atomic Age.\n"", ""So what would he think about Donald Trump, who says he wants to be, and I quote, 'unpredictable' about using the most powerful weapons ever produced? And here's the thing with nuclear weapons – as Bruce told you, when the President gives the order, that's it. There's no veto for Congress, no veto by the Joint Chiefs. The officers in the silos have no choice but to fire. And that can take as little as four minutes. That's why all those retired launch officers stepped forward and said Donald Trump should never be put in charge of our nuclear arsenal.\n"", ""Earlier you heard from one of them, Bruce Blair, and his story is worth remembering. In 1973, Bruce was a young military officer working in an underground bunker in Montana. His job was to launch as many as 50 nuclear weapons if the President ever gave the order. Then one night in October, as the United States and the Soviet Union squared off over an escalating conflict in the Middle East, the emergency message he had trained for arrived: prepare for nuclear war. Like other American officers in bunkers and submarines and bombers around the world, Bruce and his colleagues started the process because that was their duty. They unlocked the safe, took out the launch codes and the keys, and then strapped into their chairs to brace for the shockwaves that would come if a Russian warhead detonated above them. Then they waited for the final order from the President. Thankfully, it never came. But when Bruce looks at Donald Trump, and sees his hair-trigger temper, and he thinks about what it felt like inside that bunker that night. As I've said many times, a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.\n"", ""And that brings me to the second question I think voters should pose to both candidates: How do you handle a crisis? We've seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he's gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he's challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. When he's confronted with his own words. So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. Imagine his advisors afraid to tell him what he doesn't want to hear, racing against his legendarily short attention span to lay out life-and-death choices too complex to be reduced to a single tweet. And then imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin.\n"", ""Now thankfully, he's never been in a position where he had to help make life-and-death decisions for our country. But there was one national crisis where we did get a good look at how Donald Trump handles himself. Donald is a New Yorker, and his finest moment in this campaign was when he defended New York against Ted Cruz's attacks in a debate. And then he invoked the days after 9/11, when New Yorkers really came together and took care of each other. And I couldn't agree more. That's why it was so upsetting to learn what Donald was actually doing on 9/11. After the world watched with horror as the Twin Towers fell, he called in to a New York TV station. And even on that horrible day, when thousands of people lost their lives, he couldn't stop himself from pointing out that now, because the towers had fallen, a building he owned was now the tallest in Lower Manhattan. What kind of a person brags at a moment like that? I'll tell you: someone who should never set foot in the Oval Office and serve as Commander in Chief.\n"", ""For me, I take this very personally, my friends. Because I was one of New York's senators along with Chuck Schumer on 9/11. He and I were on the ground the very next day, meeting with the Governor, the Mayor, emergency officials. And I will never forget the sight of Ground Zero. The thick smoke made it hard to breathe or see. Some of the firefighters and other first responders we met had been on duty nonstop since the planes hit the towers. They had all lost friends. In a makeshift command center, we were briefed on the damage, and it was clear we were going to need a lot of help to recover New York, and we were going to have to really make it our absolute mission to not only rebuild New York but to keep America safe.\n"", ""That's what I did for eight years as a senator. I never stopped fighting to keep our country safer and to ensure that first responders got the medical care they needed. And I think it's important to reflect on what each of us has done in moments like that. Because a lot of the crises that come at a president are not predicted. They happen. I'll tell you a quick story. It was after President-elect Obama asked me to be secretary of state but before the inauguration. And I got a call to come to an emergency meeting in the White House in the Situation Room. And the new Obama national security team was on one side of table, and the outgoing Bush national security team was on the other side. And the Bush Administration had gotten credible intelligence that there was going to be an attack at our inauguration.\n"", 'So even before we were sworn in to do our jobs, we were faced with helping to make such a consequential decision. It really matters what your experience has, what your values are, whether you can be counted on to make that decision. You learn a lot about people in moments like that. And as I sat there with the pressure on, having to think through in my own head, how we evaluated this intelligence, how we did everything we could to preserve our inauguration of our first African American president on the Mall in Washington.\n', ""We made the decision to go forward, obviously. Some of you might have been there. But we also did everything we could to double our efforts to find out about the intelligence and to secure the hundreds of thousands of people who would be there. So you have to ask yourself: in a crisis, who would you trust? Who will listen to good advice, keep a level head and make the right call? Because that's the person you want as our president and Commander in Chief.\n"", ""Now let's get to the third question for all of the voters to consider about each of us. Do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries? Now this may seem like an easy question. If you got it on an exam, I think you'd be able to answer it. But apparently it's hard for Donald. He has picked fights with our friends. I mean the President of Mexico, the British prime minister, the German chancellor, pretty much the entire nation of Japan… and he even picked a fight with the Pope. And at the same time he is praising tyrants and dictators like Saddam Hussein and Kim Jong Un in North Korea and Bashar al-Assad for their supposed strong leadership. He even praised the Chinese government for massacring protesters in Tiananmen Square. Trump has repeatedly suggested he would abandon our allies in Europe and Asia.\n"", ""He has called NATO, quote, 'obsolete.' Obsolete? NATO is the greatest military alliance in the history of the world. And it's based on something called Article V, which says, 'An attack on one is an attack on all.' And Article V has only been invoked one time: when our allies came to our defense after 9/11. We still have NATO allies fighting side by side, working side by side with American troops in Afghanistan. They joined us in going after Al Qaeda and Bin Laden. Now we're supposed to tell them we won't have their back?\n"", ""And by the way—right now, our NATO allies are helping identify and track terrorists who threaten America and Europe. They're hosting radar and missile defense installations that protect us against potential threats from Iran and elsewhere. And as our NATO forces in Afghanistan stand shoulder-to-shoulder with American troops, they share the risks and burdens. Now they're moving into the Baltic States to deter Russian aggression.\n"", ""Treating our allies like the small businesses and contractors that Trump exploited and stiffed in Atlantic City – hanging them out to dry -- would make our country and our world less safe. And it would play right into the hands of Russia and China, which are envious of our alliances and eager to see them weaken or fail. But maybe that's the point. Because what's most striking about all of this -- and I would argue most important for voters to consider – is the relationship between Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n"", ""As former Secretary Madeleine Albright put it, and I quote her, 'We have never seen a mind meld of the kind between the Russian leadership and a candidate for the presidency of the United States.' Michael Morell, who ran the CIA and grew up just a few miles from here, has said that Putin is manipulating Donald. Putin is a trained intelligence officer from the old KGB. He knows he can use flattery to get into Donald's head -- to make Donald the Kremlin's puppet. And It seems to be working.\n"", ""Donald has signaled to Putin that he will let Russia do whatever it wants, from Ukraine to Syria and beyond. He's even said Putin is a stronger leader than President Obama. And it gets worse. The U.S. intelligence community has now confirmed that the Russian government, which means Putin, is directing cyber-attacks against targets in the United States to influence the outcome of our election.\n"", ""So ask yourself, why would Putin be trying to get Donald Trump elected President? Could it be because of all of the nice things Donald has said about him, or the fact that he's promised to adopt pro-Kremlin policies, or maybe because of his extensive business dealings with Russian oligarchs with ties to Putin? Since Donald still won't release his tax returns, and don't hold your breath, we don't know the full extent of his business relationships --but what we do know is disturbing.\n"", ""And we know this: We are dealing with something unprecedented in the history of our country. A foreign adversary trying to influence our presidential election. That should scare everyone, Democrat, Republican, and Independent. With the election just eight days away, this can't wait any longer. Donald Trump should immediately disclose all of his ties and connections to the Kremlin and its associates. The American people deserve to know the full extent of these links and how they relate to what the Russians are doing in our election.\n"", ""When you step back and take it all in, it's no surprise that 50 Republican national security experts wrote an open letter saying that they will not vote for Donald Trump, because he would be – in their words – 'the most reckless President in American history.' It's no surprise that not a single former President, Secretary of State or Defense, or National Security Advisor from either party has endorsed him. It's no surprise that Bob Gates, who served eight presidents over 50 years, Democrats and Republicans alike, has said Trump is, and I quote, 'beyond repair… stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government… temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform… unqualified and unfit to be commander-in-chief.'\n"", ""I hope you and voters across Ohio and America will think about all of these national security issues when you cast your vote in this election. Think about what it takes to lead -- and how we want to secure the safety of our country, our children and our grandchildren. And who is best to do that. So make no mistake, that really is what is on the ballot this year. It's not just my name and Donald Trump's name. It's our future. Our security. Our values. It's who we are as a country.\n"", ""Donald Trump has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart. But the good news is: There's another vision for America. Instead of dark and divisive, it's hopeful and inclusive and optimistic and unified. And it is big-hearted, not small-minded. It's about lifting people up, not tearing each other down. It's a vision that says, as I believe in my heart that we are stronger together.\n"", 'Millions of people across our country are standing up and saying: We believe in an America that is great because it is good. That is Democrats, Republicans and Independents. Because we believe in an America where women are respected. An America where veterans are honored, parents are supported, and workers are paid fairly … an America where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong…. an America that leads in the world and lives up to our values… where everyone counts and everyone has a place. Where the American dream is big enough for everyone.\n', ""This goes way beyond policies and partisanship. We're talking about what it really means to be an American in the 21st century. About the basic lessons we want to teach boys and girls, kids and grandkids. It turns out, if you dig deep enough, through all the mud of politics, eventually you hit something hard and true. A foundation of fundamental values that unite us as Americans – basic beliefs about equality and opportunity and freedom and common decency.\n"", ""That's something to defend – and to build on. And, in the end, that's what this election is all about. Here in Ohio, you can make the difference. Early voting has already begun. So now is the time. Every phone call you make, every door you knock, moves us forward. You can go to hillaryclinton.com, and sign up to volunteer. Or text J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6 to do the same.\n"", 'Sometimes -- if you have studied history -- you know the fate of the greatest nations comes down to single moments in time. This is one of those make-or-break moments for the United States. And it truly is in your hands, as it should be. When your kids and grandkids ask you what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, I hope you will be able to say: I voted for a better, stronger, fairer America. A place where our future will be created and charted by people will have confidence that that the best days of America are still ahead of us. Particularly young people who I believe absolutely should help make that future!\n', ""So let's come together, let us make clear that we are going to stand up for an America that we believe in because that America believes in us.

And when it comes to handling a crisis, we\'ve seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation – when he\'s gotten a tough question from a reporter, or when he\'s challenged in a debate, or when he sees a protestor at a rally, when he\'s confronted by his own words. So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. [Cries of ""No!""] Imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin. I hope you\'ll think about that when you cast your vote in this election. Think about what it takes to lead in a very complicated world, and in whose hands you want to put the safety of our children and grandchildren.', ""And think about the difference between electing a president who will do nothing and president who will tackle the epidemic of gun violence in America. As Gabby knows so well, 33,000 Americans a year are killed guns. Thousands more are injured. It's an average of 90 people a day dying. Here in Ohio more people are killed by guns than die in car crashes. We have seen moviegoers gunned down in theaters, little children killed in their classrooms, clubgoers massacred in Orlando, nine faithful people murdered at Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina. And we've seen far too many young African American men and women killed by gun violence, which is now the leading cause of death for young black men. And when we think about that, we think of Dontre Hamilton or Jordan Davis or Trayvon Martin and others. I've had the great honor of getting to know their mothers, who have turned their grief into action and their mourning into a movement."", ""But here's what I want to say. If anything else in our country were killing as many people, people of good faith, people who believe, like we do, in the Second Amendment, people who own guns, people who go hunting, people who are collectors, we would say, hey, wait a minute. This can't go on. We need comprehensive background checks to close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole. And we know here in Ohio a majority of gun owners support these common-sense steps to prevent gun violence because they know we can respect the Second Amendment and keep our kids and communities safe at the same time. And we need to keep guns out of the hands suspected terrorists. If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun, period."", ""And look. There is a very clear difference. Donald Trump won't stand up to the gun lobby. He's sold out to them. In fact, the gun lobby is spending more on ads to get Donald Trump elected than any other group, more than $7 million in Ohio alone. And in return, Donald Trump has promised to repeat President Obama's actions to strengthen criminal background checks. Donald says guns should be allowed in nightclubs that serve alcohol. He's even said, on his very first day in office, he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms. How can anyone think our schools would be safer with more guns?"", ""So I have stood up to the gun lobby for years, which is why they are running all of these ads against me. And I will stand up to them as president. I will work with Gabby and Mark and Americans for Responsible Solutions to pass common sense reforms because we've got to keep guns out of the wrong hands and help save lives."", ""I will also get up every day in the White House working my heart out for you, whatever I can do to knock down barriers to empower people, to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. That's how I was raised. I was raised to believe that if you work hard – and I believe in hard work – you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in America. And I will never ever quit on you. When I tell you I'm going to try to do something that will make a positive difference in your life, I don't care what the political or other barriers are. We're going to find a way over, under, around, or through until we get it done. I've been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life, and I'm not stopping now. Remember, when our opponents go low, we go high. We're not going to be distracted. We're not going to be knocked off course. We know how much this election matters. And everything all of you can do between now and the time that the polls close is going to really count."", ""Now, the Donald Trump campaign strategy is pretty simple. They've announced it. Their strategy is: get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, and get people of color to stay home. It's all part of his scorched-earth campaign, but it actually adds up to more than half of our whole population when you stop to think about it. And it goes against everything we stand for. So if you're as upset as I am by the campaign that he has run, the things he has said, insulting not just women but immigrants, Latinos, African Americans, prisoners of war, Muslims, veterans, the military – I mean, the list goes on and on. It's almost impossible to understand how somebody could run for president who seems not to like America as much as he does."", ""So you know the best way to stop him: by showing up with the biggest turnout in history. We need more Americans to vote. And I think we have a chance to get more Americans from all walks of life to vote because we're already seeing record turnout. Twenty-three million people have already voted in this election. And more than one million of them are right here in Ohio. There is no doubt if we vote, we win. So, please, if you haven't voted early, please do so. And please get your friends and your family, everybody you know to vote. Take people to vote with you. Try to help those who might have a little problem getting there."", ""Make sure that everybody you know understands early voting has begun. And you can go to iwillvote.com to find your nearest early voting location because, make no mistake, whatever issue you care about – I've only mentioned a few tonight, but whatever issue you care about is on the ballot. Now, it may be my name and my opponent's name, but where we stand on these issues, what we've done in the past, what we have said we want to do in the future, that is all on the ballot. The future of our economy is at stake, of our education system is at stake. Fighting climate change and clean, renewable-energy jobs are at stake. LGBT equality is at stake. Equal pay for women is at stake. Actually, in the end, the American dream itself is at stake. So I want you to think about how you will feel on November 9th."", 'Audience Member: Happy.', ""Secretary Clinton: Happy. I think that's the right answer. But just suppose, just suppose you go to bed early. Suppose you go to bed early. Maybe you were too busy to vote or maybe you didn't make calls or knock on doors. I want you to imagine. So you get up early on the morning of the 9th. And you log on to the news to find out, hey, what's going on, or maybe you turn on the TV or the radio, and you hear."", 'Audience Member: No!', ""I want you to really understand what that means for you and for all of us because I prefer for us to be motivated by what we're for, not what we're against. But I also think it's prudent to imagine what could happen if we don't do our part. And when in the future somebody asks you, maybe your kids or your grandkids, 'What did you do when everything was on the line?' I want you to be able to say, 'I voted for a better, fairer, stronger America.'"", ""Let's go out and, in these next eight days, do everything we can to make it clear we're going after the kind of future that includes everybody. We're going to build this economy: new jobs, rising wages. We're going to make college affordable and help you pay down your student debt. We are going to do what will give you the best chance for your own lives and the lives of our kids and our grandkids. So if we build that future together, we will be able to say we were part of making sure that America's best days are still ahead of us. And we will prove, once and for all, that love trumps hate."", 'Thank you all.""']"
81,            Hillary Clinton          ,"November 03, 2016","['Hello, Dade City!', ""I am so excited about being here. Thank you, all for this really warm, wonderful welcome. And I thank, on behalf of all of us I want to thank Alicia Machado for that introduction and for sharing her story with us. Alicia will be voting for the very first time in this election, and I am very grateful for her support. I'm also delighted that we're joined today by your great senator Bill Nelson and his wife Grace."", 'I also want to thank Representative Amanda Hickman from the Florida State House, Michael Cox, chairman of the Greater Pasco Chamber of Commerce, Michael Ledbetter, who is the Pasco County Democratic executive committee chair and his wife Beverly. And thanks to retired Colonel Wilson Elton [inaudible] for his pledge of allegiance. And thanks to all the elected officials here. And I especially want to thank all of you for not just joining us but helping us to get out the vote in this last week!', ""It's almost hard to believe, isn't it? There are only seven days left in this election."", 'So are you ready to vote?', 'Are you ready to volunteer these last seven days?', ""I hope too that you ready to elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate! Patrick, who's been in Congress, will be an independent voice for Florida families. And I am so excited to think about what he could do, because unlike his opponent, he's never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump."", ""Now somebody asked me the other day, 'Why do you keep coming back to Florida?' Just look around folks. I mean it is a beautiful, and I have lots of friends, but it's also really important in this election. Florida can decide who our next president is, which will affect the nation and the world. And I want to make sure that every voter in Florida spends these next seven days thinking about what's at stake in this election. Because honestly I believe this may be the most important election of our lifetimes."", ""One week from today, we will be choosing our next president and commander-in-chief of the United States. I don't think the choice could be any clearer. I have spent my career fighting for children and families. I have served in the United States Senate, served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I was in the Situation Room when we brought Osama Bin Laden to justice. I represented you as your secretary of state, going to 112 countries, negotiating with friend and foe alike. I am ready to serve if you give me the great honor of being your president."", 'Now, I do have to say that I think that stands in contrast to my opponent. And maybe for you if you think about all of the issues that separate Donald Trump from me, it could be his dangerous statements about nuclear weapons.', ""When a journalist told Donald Trump that people were worried about how casually he talks about using nuclear weapons, he said, 'Well then why are we making them?'"", ""And I have to tell you yesterday I was in Ohio, and I was introduced by a gentleman who was one of our officers in charge of launching nuclear weapons if the order ever came from our president. And what he told the crowd — it was a big crowd at Kent State University — I think every voter should hear. Basically — his name was Bruce Blair — he said that, having had the responsibility of sitting in a bunker, being responsible for the codes and the keys to our nuclear weapons, he knows that when a president makes the order to launch a nuclear attack, there is no appeal. There is no veto. And that is why he has joined with dozens of former Air Force officers to send a letter to say, 'We need a president with the temperament, the steadiness, the calmness to be in charge of nuclear weapons.' And therefore they cannot support Donald Trump, because he does not have the temperament to be our commander-in-chief and handle those responsibilities."", 'So when you think about voting, early this week, voting next Tuesday, responsibility for our nuclear weapons is on the ballot.', ""So is immigration. Do we want to round up millions of people who are here working, raising their families, as he has suggested he will do? I don't think so. I think what we want is to bring them out of the shadows so that they can't be exploited by employers like Donald Trump, who refused to hire Americans and hired undocumented workers so he could pay them less. I don't think that's right."", 'Now maybe for some of you, what Donald Trump said about prisoners of war will be enough reason to vote against him, somebody who questioned the patriotism and the service of John McCain because he was a prison of war. We need a Commander in Chief who respects the service and sacrifice of the men and women who wear our uniform.', ""Or maybe for some of you, it's what he said about a judge born in Indiana, who just happened to be assigned the case brought by people who were defrauded by the phony Trump University. And so Trump said, 'Well, we can't trust him because his parents were born in Mexico.' Now Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the House, called — well, but wait a minute, — he called what Trump said about that distinguished federal judge, 'The definition of a racist comment.'"", 'And then Trump went on to attack a Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died defending our country, simply because that family was Muslim.', ""And then let's not forget, Trump spent years, years insisting that President Obama was not born in the United States, even after the birth certificate was produced. Honestly if this were something new, I think we'd all be asking ourselves, 'Well, what does he have against President Obama?' Or what does he have against me? But this is not new. I know I'm reaching out to Republicans and Independents as well as Democrats because I want to be the president for all Americans."", ""And here's what I want you to tell. I want you to tell your Republican friends, in 1987 Donald Trump took out a Donald Trump took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times to criticize President Reagan. He said, 'Our leaders are the laughing stock of the world.' So this is a man who thinks that he is better than President Reagan, better than President Obama – literally better than anybody, I guess. And, when you think about it, what he said at the convention, 'I alone can fix it,' runs counter to who we are as Americans. We work together."", ""So there are many reasons why I think it is fair to conclude that Donald Trump is unqualified and unfit to be president. But today, I want to just spend a few minutes focusing in particular about what he has said and what he has done to woman and girls because – Any of you see the debates? I stood next to Donald for four and a half hours during those three debates, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be President of the United States. And during those debates, Donald always used to say, 'What have you been doing for 30 years?' And I always found that kind of odd, because he could Google it and find out. And so I've been a lawyer, and I've been a first lady, and I've been a senator, and I've been Secretary of State, and I've been a wife and a mother and a grandmother and a friend and a churchgoer, and for my entire life I've been a woman."", ""And when I think about what we now know about Donald Trump and what he's been doing for 30 years, he sure has spent a lot of time demeaning, degrading, insulting, and assaulting women. And, I've got to tell you, some of what we've learned – some of this stuff is very upsetting. I would, frankly, rather be here talking about nearly anything else, like how we're going to create good jobs and get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. How we're going to make college affordable for every single family, because I have a plan that if your family makes less than $125,000, you will not pay tuition to go to a state college or university. And if you're above that, it will be debt free, and we will help you pay back the debt you already have so you can get out from under it."", ""But I can't just talk about all of the good things we want to do, because people are making up their minds. This is a consequential choice, so we've got to talk about something that, frankly, is painful, because it matters. We can't just wish it away. And a lot of his supporters don't like to hear this. I don't blame them. If I were supporting him, I wouldn't want to hear it either, to be honest. But I've got to tell you, I learned way back in elementary school and I learned it in Sunday school: it's not okay to insult people. It's not okay."", ""And look at what he does. He calls women 'ugly,' 'disgusting,' 'nasty' all the time. He calls women 'pigs,' rates bodies on a scale from 1 to 10. We just heard from Alicia. She was Miss Universe when Donald Trump owned the pageant. Well, he said she put on some weight and it made him angry, so he called her 'Miss Piggy.' He called her 'Miss Housekeeping' because she's a beautiful Latina. He brought a bunch of reporters to a gym to watch him order her around to exercise. Now, he also said, 'This is somebody who likes to eat.' Well, I have to say: who doesn't like to eat? I mean, really, can we just stop for a minute and reflect on the absurdity of Donald Trump finding fault with Miss Universe?"", ""But you've got to ask: why does he do these things? Who acts like this? And, I'll tell you who: a bully, that's who. And thankfully, Alicia refuses to let such a small person get her down. She knows that Donald Trump doesn't get to decide her value in her eyes and in the eyes of her family and her friends."", ""But what about our girls? What about girls watching all this? What happens to their confidence, their sense of self-worth? If you've got a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister, a mother, a wife, a good friend, someone like this becoming president who insults more than half the population of the United States of America? And what about our boys? This is not someone we want them looking up to."", ""Not so long ago, I was the mother of a teenage girl. And every day I tried to make sure that she knew she was smart and she was capable, and I'm doing the same thing with my granddaughter and my grandson. Because, let's be honest here, the world has a way of telling our girls exactly the opposite – they don't look right, they're not thin enough, they don't act right, no one will like them unless they change their clothes or straighten their hair or stop being bossy, or whatever the criticism might be. Right?"", ""And I remember, when Chelsea was a teenager, I would wait on the second floor of the White House in the long hall that's there for her to come home from school. And sometimes, we only had a few minutes together. But before she'd run off to talk to her friends or do whatever she was planning to, I would figure out how was the day. We'd talk about what was on her mind. And that time together was really valuable to me as a parent, because we parents, and I know there are a lot of parents here today, we work hard to give our kids a sense of confidence to send them out into the world believing in their own value, and it really is important that we don't let anybody take that away from them. And we want them to be strong, and we don't want them to feel bad about themselves. And we've got to work hard to make sure our boys, just like our girls, have that same sense of positive energy: not negative, not tearing people down – lifting people up and respecting women."", ""In fact, all of us should respect each other in our country. So, when I look at my granddaughter and my grandson, I am on the same mission. I want them to know they're love, they're cared for, they're respected. I want them to develop a good work ethic. I believe in hard work, and I want them to go out and prove themselves in the world. But that's what I want for every child. I have spent my life doing everything I could to help kids and families. It will be the mission of my presidency. I will get up every day in the White House trying to figure out: how can we knock down the barriers, overcome the challenges so that people living here in Pasco County can get ahead and stay ahead?"", ""So I know there's work to be done. We can't do it with just words alone. We've got to do more to stop treatment about women being somehow objectified. And, oh my gosh, when we heard that tape and we heard what he does to women. I'm not going to repeat it. But you know what Donald Trump was bragging about: grabbing women, mistreating women. And I have to tell you, since that tape came out, twelve women have come to say that, 'What he said on that tape is what he did to me.'"", ""And then we heard his response. What he does at his rallies is to go after those women all over again, insulting them. He said he couldn't possibly have said those things because the women weren't attractive enough to assault. 'Look at her,' he said about one woman. 'I don't think so.' About another, he said, 'She wouldn't be my first choice.'"", ""He's also on tape bragging with the radio personality Howard Stern about how he used to go backstage at beauty pageants to barge in on the women while they were getting dressed. He said he did that — he said he did that to 'inspect' them. That was his word – and he said, 'I sort of get away with things like that.' And sure enough, contestants have come forward to say, 'Yes, that's exactly what he did to us.' Now, as bad as that is, he didn't just do it at the Miss USA pageant or the Miss Universe pageant. He's also been accused of doing it at the Miss Teen USA pageant. Contestants say that Donald Trump came in to look at them when they were changing. Some of them were just 15 years old."", ""We cannot hide from this. We've got to be willing to face it. This man wants to be president of the United States of America and our First Lady, Michelle Obama, spoke for many of us when she said Donald Trump's words have shaken her to her core."", ""For a lot of women who have gone through something like this in your lives, that's brought back painful memories. And for men who would never, ever talk or act like Donald, it's been shocking to see this. He tried to explain it away as 'locker room talk,' well, I'll tell you what, a lot of professional athletes stood up and said, 'Not in our locker rooms. That does not happen.'"", 'Well, I guess the bottom line is he thinks belittling women makes him a bigger man.', ""And I don't think there's a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like."", ""He doesn't look at us and see full human beings, with our dreams and purposes, our own capabilities. And he has shown us that clearly throughout this campaign."", ""Well, he's very wrong. He is wrong about both the women and the men of this country. He has shown us who he is. Let us on Tuesday show him who we are. We can stand up for what we believe, what we want for our children and grandchildren, what we know is right. And you can go down the list of everything he has said. He doesn't believe in equal pay, he thinks pregnancy is an inconvenience, he won't raise the minimum wage, and he said if he comes home and dinner is not on the table, he gets angry. Instead of supporting women who are out there supporting their families, he wants to make it even harder."", ""Well, I have a message for him. We're going to fight for affordable childcare. We're going to fight for equal pay for all people. We're going to fight for paid family leave, we're going to fight to make sure everybody gets raising wages in America and that's important because so many people still struggling, still working hard, raising a family, having a hard time getting all of their bills paid. And that's especially true for minimum wage workers — who — two-thirds of whom are women, so we've got work to do my friends. I'm excited because I know we can do this and I will stand up and I will fight for you, I will work for you, I will give my heart to this mission of making our country all it should be. Because instead of Donald Trump's dangerous and divisive vision, mine is positive, optimistic, hopeful and unifying."", ""But I can't do any of this without your help. Early voting has already begun. Almost 26 millions Americans have already voted and that includes four million right here in Florida. Americans are voting for the kind of better future we can make together. And voting on all the issues that they care about. It may be my name and Donald's name on the ballot but everything you care about, our security, our economy, bringing our country together, the environment, clean water and clean air!"", 'Here in Dade City, you can vote every day from now until November 5th, from 7am to 7pm.', ""In fact, right now, the East Pasco Government Center is just a few minutes' drive away. You can go there right after this rally and vote. Because, we need everybody to stand up in this election."", 'And if you have a mail-in ballot at home, send it in when you get home today.', ""Don't wait to send it back! Talk friends and family and neighbors and co-workers."", ""Donald Trump's strategy is pretty simple– he said he wants to suppress young people from voting women from voting, people of color from voting, that is a lot of people. By showing up with the biggest turnout ever we will show him and everybody a message that that is not who we are."", ""Now I know here in this county and this larger region, you probably know some people who are going to vote for Trump. And here is what I want to ask you, I want you to talk with them. Ask them what they care about. Ask them what kind of future they want for their economy. Because Donald Trump's economic plan is slashing taxes on the wealthy and big corporations. I have said that I want the wealthy to pay their fair share and I will not raise taxes on anybody making less than $250,000 a year."", 'So there could not be, no matter what you care about, a bigger difference between me and Donald Trump, and I hope that you will come out and volunteer for these last seven days.', 'We are signing up for volunteer shifts making calls, knocking on doors, it really matters, turn out matters.', 'Please go to hillaryclinton.com to see how you can get involved. Here is what I want to leave you with. You know, I feel like so many of you, our country is already great but we can make is greater. The main reason America is great is because America is good. We are a big hearted, generous people. Not a small minded people. We know that if everybody works together we will get farther together than if we separate people, we push them down, we engage in all the negativity that we have heard too much in this campaign. But sometimes, the fate of even the greatest nations lie in the balance. For America, this is one of those make or break elections. It really is in your hands.', 'I hope you will think about how you will feel the day after the election on November 9th. are we going to more forward together or are we going to move backwards by someone who wants to bully us? And I hope, I hope you will think about how together we can make a difference, I want to be your partner as well as your president, I want us to create the best possible future for our children and our grandchildren. That is what I will work my heart out to do and I hope you will help me to make a better, fairer, stronger America. Where we prove once and for all that love trumps hate!', 'Thank you all.']"

We talked about the damage that Hurricane Matthew has done; the lives lost; the homes lost; and also the agricultural damage with all the flooding. And my heart goes out to everyone who has been affected. We\'ve got to be really focused on what we\'re going to do with this extreme weather. We\'re getting more of it in more places.

Her mother, who is determined, began doing investigations; she found out that there were some possible treatments. But they were expensive. She didn\'t know what she was going to do. And she took her daughter to the doctor and the doctor said ""I just heard about this new program, the children\'s health insurance program. Maybe you can qualify for that.""\n', ""Because it's really for families that aren't poor, but don't have much money, and a lot of families isn't it. And families that don't have an employer that provides health insurance, self employed, independent contractors.\n"", ""So, the mom found out about this thing call the children's health program and low and behold they did qualify and they started the treatments for their daughter. I met that young woman, and she said hello to me and she talked to me. She just graduated from college, right here in North Carolina. So don't let anybody tell you, it doesn't matter what you stand for, what you fight for, and who you are trying to help. When you make your decision about who to vote for in this election.\n"", 'As a Senator from New York I worked to rebuild New York City after the 9/11 attacks and to provide healthcare to the brave first responders who ran toward danger not away from it. And many of them—\n', 'Audience: [inaudible]\n', ""Clinton: Where you there? God bless you. That's another thing, I meet people all over who were there, and who worked there and I meet people who got sick because they worked there. And as your Secretary of State, I traveled to 112 countries negotiated cease fires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women's right and LGBT rights around the world.\n"", 'And everything I\'ve done, it\'s because I\'ve been listening to people and again I know that\'s not very exciting. I plead to that. You spend time listening not talking, you know, what are the poor journalists going to say, ""Uh, there Hillary Clinton was listening again,"" right?\n', ""But I'll tell you it is what motivates me to hear people's stories, to hear the tribulations and triumphs. You get good ideas. Bring people together; find common ground, even with people we disagree with. I disagree with people on lots of issues, but I believe the only way we can get things done is to actually listen and respect each other, and try to find common that common ground. And that will enable us to get results for people. And if you elect me next Tuesday that is the kind of President I'll be.\n"", ""And from the first day of this campaign, I've been telling you what I want to do. Putting forth my ideas about what I think will help you. I truly believe that you deserve a candidate that you can vote for, not just someone to vote against. And so if we are gonna make this choice we have got to be clear. The positives and the negatives, because one way or the other, come this January, America is going to have a new President. And it will be either me or Donald Trump.\n"", ""And you know what else? People say all the time, you know I want change, will come, that is certain. The question is what kind of change are we going to have. Are we going to work together to build a stronger fairer better America, or are we going to fear the future and fear each other and hunker down and be paralyzed by all of our prejudices, our discrimination that stops us from coming together? So, here is what I want you to do in these next days as you talk with people who maybe haven't yet voted, maybe haven't yet made up their mind. I want you to ask them, imagine it is January 20th, 2017 and it is Donald Trump standing in front of the capital taking the Oath of Office.\n"", ""Imagine what that will be like to have him in the Oval Office, making the decisions that effect your lives and your futures. Imagine having a president who demeans women, mocks the disabled, insults African Americans and Latinos. Who pits people against each other instead of pulling them together. Someone who always puts himself first and doesn't care who gets hurt along the way\n"", ""A president with a very thin skin, who lashes out at anyone who challenges him. Who praises adversaries like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our allies and even attacked the Pope. The truth is we don't have to imagine what that would be like, because everything that Donald Trump has said and done, both in his career and in his campaign, is a preview of what could happen.\n"", 'You know as Michelle Obama says, the presidency doesn\'t change who you are, it reveals who you are. And we have all see all we need of Donald Trump. If Donald Trump were to win this election, we would have a commander and chief who is completely out of his depth and whose ideas are incredibly dangerous. Someone who wants more countries to have nuclear weapons, and who could easily insult a foreign leader and start a real war instead of just a twitter war. And yet this morning in Florida, Donald stood on a stage and said and I quote ""I am honored to have the greatest temperament that anyone has ever had"". Now -- he knows we can see and hear him, right?\n', ""This is someone who at another rally, yesterday, actually said out loud to himself, stay on point Donald, Stay on point. His campaign probably put that in the teleprompters, stay on point Donald, stay on point. You know, we have seen it over and over again. We know his true self. His instinct is to say whatever pops into his head, no matter how wrong he is. He can't help himself. So is this someone we want to put in charge of our military?\n"", 'Is this someone that we want to treat people the way he has demonstrated, his disrespect throughout this campaign. In a country that values, religious liberty and freedom. Someone who would ban every Muslim in the world from ever coming to our country. Someone who thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and despair. He has no idea, none, about the strength of the black church, the vibrancy of black owned businesses, the excellence of historically black colleges and universities, the rise of a new generation of black activists for social justice and the success of black leaders in every field. Remember how he denied housing to Mae Brown Wiggins. And Mae wasn\'t alone. Whenever African Americans tried to rent an apartment, their application was marked with a ""C"" -- ""C"" for colored.\n', ""In fact, Donald, his father Fred and their entire company were sued by the Justice Department for discriminating against African Americans and Latinos in the 1970s. They settled the case, but the Justice Department was forced to go after them again because they continued to discriminate against people of color. Think about that. If he were to win, he would be in charge of the federal housing department. If he doesn't respect all Americans, how can we trust him to serve all Americans?\n"", 'And then another recent example is the way Donald Trump treated what are called the ""Central Park Five."" These were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14. Who, it turns out, were wrongly convicted of a terrible crime in New York back in 1990.\n', 'Donald Trump took out full-page ads in four newspapers calling for the death penalty for these kids. Nearly three decades later, they were exonerated by DNA evidence. Also, someone else confessed to the crime. So they were finally released from prison and justice was done, but not only did Donald Trump refuse to apologize for calling for their execution, he actually said they should still be in prison.\n', 'To him, those kids will still and always be guilty no matter what the evidence says. Do we want this man appointing judges? Do we want him controlling the Justice Department?\n', 'Audience: No!\n', ""Clinton: Well, people who are voting for him, that's what they would get. He has spent this entire campaign offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters. He retweets white supremacists and spreads racially tinged conspiracy theories. And you better believe he's being heard loudly and clearly.\n"", 'Just a few days ago, and I want you to hear this because this has never happened to a major -- to a nominee of a major party. Just a few days ago, Donald Trump was endorsed by the official newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan.\n', 'They wrote their endorsement under the slogan of his campaign, ""Make America Great Again."" They said it\'s about preserving white identity. And they placed their faith and hope in him. You\'ve got to ask yourself: Do any of us -- any of us who believe in our Constitution, who believe in the rule of law, who believe that we are stronger together, who believe that we want to keep moving positively toward the vision of freedom and equality set forth by our founders -- do any of us have a place in Trump\'s America?\n', ""It's not just about communities of color. It's about young people. It's about any of us who don't ever want us to go back to a time when you could officially discriminate; where people could be intimidated. That is not who America is and we're not going to let it ever go back to that.\n"", ""But it doesn't end there. You've also got to ask: Do women and girls have a place either? Imagine our daughters, or in my case now my granddaughter, growing up with someone who ranks women by their looks; gives them numbers and brags about doing things to them without their consent. Just imagine what that would mean to young women's confidence and self-worth. And how that will affect our young men and boys, who we want to teach and nurture also to respect each other and respect girls and women as well.\n"", ""So, this is a pretty clear choice, North Carolina. I've said many times in this campaign that Donald Trump has showed us who he is. Now we have to decide who we are. Right?\n"", ""And across America, people are doing just that -- rejecting Trump's dark and divisive vision for one that is much more hopeful, inclusive and unifying. We know that America is big-hearted, not small-minded. We want to lift people up, not tear people down.\n"", ""We are called -- we are called. In fact, we are commanded, those of us who are Christians, to love our neighbor as ourselves, aren't we? We are not asked, we are not requested, we are not urged -- we are commanded. And we know how hard that is. When I used to teach Sunday School, I often taught on that, not because it was well known, but because I think it's so hard and challenging.\n"", ""Love your neighbor as yourself? Well, first, you've got to love yourself. You've got to respect yourself. And then you have to love your neighbor as yourself. I believe with all my heart that we are better than this. And that's why I want to paint a different picture. Because here's what we're going to do if we win this election. We're going to take on systemic racism with a full commitment and real follow through.\n"", 'We are not going to accept the status quo. What happened to that church in Mississippi yesterday should not be normal. People painted ""vote Trump"" on the side. And then they set it on fire. Who would do that to a house of worship? In America, that can never be acceptable. What happened in Flint, Michigan should not be normal or acceptable -- little babies, toddlers, children drinking water that was poisoning them. And there are too many young African Americans who are dying either in police incidents or from random gun violence. You know their names: Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Sander Bland, Key Scott. So many. We can\'t accept that as normal either.\n', ""So we are going to get to work. I'm just telling you. If I'm fortunate enough to be your president, we're going to roll up our sleeves and get to work, because that's when we're at our best, solving our problems.\n"", ""We're going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and replace it with a cradle-to-career pipeline for every child in this country. I want to make sure that our kids have the chance to thrive with good schools and good teachers no matter what ZIP code they live in.\n"", 'We will reform our criminal justice system from end to end. It is wrong. And I don\'t care whether you are black or white. It is wrong that black men are far more likely to be stopped by police, charged and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for the same crimes. It\'s wrong, and we\'re going to do something about that. And Donald Trump, whenever he\'s face with these issues says ""well the answer to our problems is more law and order."" He doesn\'t tell you what he means by that, but it\'s kind of code for fear and division. What I think we need to do, is to work together to restore trust between our police and our communities.\n', 'I think we are all safer when everyone has respect for the law, and everyone is respected by the law. And it\'s not all, we are going to take common sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives, because right now, we\'ve got too many people who should not have excess to weapons: the mentally ill, felons, domestic abusers, terrorists. You know, we can\'t just bow down and say theres nothing we can do, commensurate with the second amendment. Donald\'s always trying to say ""oh, you know, she\'s going to repeal the second amendment."" What nonsense. Absolute nonsense. But I believe we can respect and honor the second amendment, and keep people safer by keeping guns out of the wrong hands.\n', ""And we're going to make significant investments in communities that have been let down and left behind. Congressman Butterfield and I were talking about this. There's some good ideas in the Congress to focus on communities, white, black, Latino, Native American, wherever they might be that have been left out. We need to get the engine of economic growth going, because we believe that we should have an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. We believe that we should raise the national minimum wage, because anyone who works full time in poverty should not be mired and left behind. And I think not only do Americans deserve a raise, which Donald doesn't agree with and wanted to eliminate the national minimum wage, I think it's finally time for women to get equal pay for the work we do.\n"", ""I don't know about you, but this is not just a women's issue. I'm always accused by Donald and his supporters, that whenever I talk like that, I'm playing the woman's card. Well, I've always said, if that's playing the woman's card, deal me in, you got that right.\n"", ""But I actually think I'm playing the family economics card, because if you have a mother, a wife, a sister or a daughter, she deserves to be paid fairly for what she does in the work force.\n"", ""And we're going to have a big investments in new jobs, infrastructure jobs, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems. And we're going to do more to bring advanced manufacturing to inner cities and rural communities. Put people to work, doing work that has a really productive purpose. We're going to invest in more clean, renewable energy jobs, these are jobs that cannot be exported, they have to be done right here in eastern North Carolina.\n"", 'Now it\'s fair to say ""Ok, that sounds good, how are you going to do all that?"" Ok, I\'ll tell you two things. First, I have said, and you can hold me to it, I will not - will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,00 a year. You see, I come from the middle class. My dad never made anything near that, even in those dollars back in those days. But I know that the best way to grow our economy is from the middle out and the bottom up. Not the top down, that does not work for most Americans. And so, secondly, I\'m going where the money is. The money has gone to the wealthiest of Americans and big corporations in the last 15 years. And if you ask Donald Trump what is his economic policy? It is to give trillions - trillions of dollars in tax cuts to himself, to his family, to the wealthy, to corporations. I just think that\'s a bad, bad idea.\n', ""We're going to make the wealthy pay their fair share, and we're going to make sure Wall Street never threatens Main Street again. And we're going to make public colleges like East Carolina University tuition-free. Tuition-free for working and middle class families, and debt free for everybody else. And if you're struggling with student debt, we have a plan to ease that burden and cut your bills, and get you out from under debt. And we're going to create $25 billion fund specifically aimed at supporting historically black colleges and universities.\n"", ""But I don't think that every young person needs to go college. If you want to, I'm going to make it affordable for you, but if you also want some other way of making a good living, let's bring technical education back into high schools and connect them up with community colleges and business apprenticeships.\n"", ""There is such a stark difference on every issue that matters between me and my opponent, and I'm asking folks who are still making up their minds to really search your heart about what kind of country we are, and what kind of future we want. I just don't believe we're at our best when we stoke fear about each other. Now, that does not mean we have to agree about everything, of course not. But it does mean we have to be willing to listen and to come together to solve problems that affect us individually and as a society.\n"", ""I don't think I have all the answers, I don't think anybody does. When Donald Trump at his conventions said he alone could fix everything in America, I thought about our founders meeting in Philadelphia. It wasn't one person creating our country, it was many people working together. Think about every social movement, every economic advance, every university like this one, every achievement that you've made in your own life, somebody helped you. You worked with somebody. Look at this community. Everybody working together, making Greenville really grow and thrive, making this university better and better every single year. That is my experience of America, so here's what I hope you will do. I hope you will get everybody you know, and yourselves , if you haven't voted yet, to vote early. Because the other's strategy is to scare people and intimidate people from going to the polls. Now, Donald Trump's campaign knows that if women turn out, if people of color turn out, if young people turn out, if people who share our vision of a positive unified country, turnout, there's no way he can win, because that is more than half the people in America.\n"", ""You may have noticed that President Obama was in Chapel Hill yesterday. He's coming back to North Carolina tomorrow, because he know how hard it is to get anything done in Washington. As he said yesterday, everything we've done is dependent on him being to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things he does. Well I'll tell you what, I'm ready to grab that baton. He's going to have to bend down for me to be able to reach it, because you know he's a tall man. But I've been practicing. I spent four years working with him. I call him my partner and my friend, and I am ready to defend and build on his progress, coming out of his eight years of the presidency.\n"", ""So let's get out and vote, and let's vote for the kind of future that we want, the kind of country that we want. Find your early voting location for the next three days, please, go take people there. We will show once and for all, love trumps hate, thank you all.""]"

I'll tell you -- I'll tell you, Deborah and her race are the talk of everywhere.

And you know, occasionally I would interject and say what I had done.\n', ""And today, in Greenville, we had a perfect comparison.

She was a nurse in New York City back in the 1970's, excited about being a young nurse, getting her career off to a start.

""Well, we have no apartments left.""\n', 'Well, she thought that was pretty peculiar and so she decided to do a little investigation and she found out that all of her African- American friends who had gone to that apartment run by Donald Trump and his father, Fred, had been told there were no apartments.\n', 'So she had the gumption to go and make a complaint, which led to the Justice Depart-ment suing them for discrimination.

I had a role in helping to create the Children's Health Insurance Program as first lady, and let me tell you, one of the great -- one of the great honors as I travel across the country is meeting young people who are the beneficiaries or meeting their families.\n"", ""I met a woman here in North Carolina who told her story and we actually recorded it because all of us were so moved by what she had to say when her baby was born.

It\'s for people who are not poor, but they don\'t make enough money to afford that kind of insurance, and they don\'t work for an employer who provides it. You should look into it."" And she did.

Thank you Wendell.\n"", ""You know, there's something special about this place. And some of you may have recognized the song that was playing when I came in, an amazing anthem sung by the talented Andra Day called 'Rise Up.' And that is what Detroit is doing – you are rising up!

We are going to rise up and make sure the American dream is big enough for everyone.\n"", ""I'm looking forward to working with the great team you have here in Detroit and in Michigan.

I want to thank your members of Congress, Congressman John Conyers, Sandy Levin, Congresswomen Brenda Lawrence and Debbie Dingell. I want to thank your great mayor, Mayor Mike Duggan, and thank you. Wayne County Executive Warren Evans. Sheriff Benny Napoleon. The president of the UAW, Dennis Williams. Longtime friends and former colleagues of mine, former Senator Carl Levin and his wife Barbara are here. And to all who are present today. And I was delighted that my friend and my supporter, Mark Cuban, could be here because – he's not only a real billionaire – he's actually shared his profits with his employees.\n"", 'Now, are you ready to vote on Tuesday? Are you ready to volunteer to get everybody out to vote? Are you ready to choose our next president and commander-in-chief? Did any of you see the three debates that we had? Well, I spent four and a half hours standing next to Donald Trump, proving once and for all I have the stamina to be the next president.\n', ""Now, he kept saying a lot of unusual things, didn't he? And, you know, there's a certain preparation you do to be ready for those debates, and of course I did it because I think you should prepare to be president of the United States. And I did practice my composure. People said to me, well, how did you do that? The things he was saying. And then in that second debate when he was following you around and lurching over you. I said, well, I did practice. And I had my friends and my family just spend hours saying terrible things to me. So I was ready. But he would say, like, 'Well, what have you done for 30 years?' And you know, I don't want to brag. But I do think it matters what you've done, and especially what you've done that maybe improves somebody else's life, right?\n"", ""And one of the great joys of this campaign has been traveling around our country meeting people who have been affected by what we've been doing. For example, as First Lady, I helped create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers eight million kids. And these are families that they're not poor families, they're working people, but they don't make enough money and they don't work for somebody who provides insurance, and so very often their kids were being affected by not getting the health care they should have had. I met a woman whose baby daughter when she was born was diagnosed as totally deaf, and the doctor said, 'We're sorry, there's really nothing we can do for her.' But this mother, like many mothers I know, did not take that for an answer, right? She got on the internet. She began to research and she found that there were treatments that she could maybe provide to her little daughter, but they were expensive and she and her husband didn't have that kind of money and they didn't have insurance. She was at her doctor's office and just so distraught, and the doctor said, 'Well, there's this new thing called the Children's Health Insurance Program. Maybe you should look into it.' Turned out she was eligible. She signed up. She started giving her daughter the best health care that every child in this country should be able to have, by the way. And when I was in North Carolina, I heard about her and I got to meet her, but more than that, I met her daughter, who talked to me and who just graduated from college – because she got the health care and she got the treatment that she deserved to have.\n"", ""I'll tell you what, that is how I judge my last 30 years. Have I done something to help somebody else? I am well aware of the blessings that I have had, and I want to be sure that all of us figure out a way to pay it forward, make it possible for more families, more kids to have the chance to live up to their own God-given potential.\n"", ""And I was a Senator in New York on 9/11, so I know what can happen – the evil and the hatred of terrorism. I saw it. And I spent my time helping to rebuild New York City and helping to get health care for the brave first responders who ran toward danger, not away from it – our police, our firefighters, our EMTs. And I'll tell you who else we got covered. We got construction workers who ran with their supplies and their tools, and I see one right out there who knows exactly what I'm talking about. All across the city, people were leaving their job sites and rushing toward danger. That was America at its best. And don't ever forget what we are capable of being, who we are. We are not afraid. We are brave, courageous people who will do our best if given the chance.\n"", ""As your Secretary of State, I went to 112 countries, negotiated ceasefires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women's rights and worker rights and LGBT rights. I'm telling you this because I want you to know that I will do everything I can. If I am honored to be your president, I will get up every day in that White House, and I will go to work for you and your families to make it possible for you to get the chances and the opportunities you deserve to have.\n"", ""I want you to have a candidate you can vote for and not just someone to vote against. That's why Tim Kaine and I have run a campaign based on ideas and issues, not insults because if you really take a look at what is at stake in this election, it is a choice between two very different visions for America. I've got to say when I hear my opponent talk about America, I don't recognize the country he's talking about. It is so dark, so divisive, so hateful. That is not the America that I believe in. I believe that we should have a confident, optimistic, inclusive vision of where we're going and how we're going to get there. I love our country, and I believe in the American people. And I think there's nothing we can't achieve if we work together and we set some goals and we go after them. You see, we believe in an America that is bighearted, not small-minded. We believe in an America that is already great but can be greater if we do our part. And we believe America is great because America is good. Never forget that. If we lift each other up and not tear each other down, we can go even further. And I believe with all my heart. That's why the slogan of my campaign sums it up, that we are stronger together.\n"", 'And so come next January 20th, America is going to have a new president. I know – I know that – I know that a lot of people say that they want change. Well, let me tell you this. Change is inevitable. There will be change. The question is, what kind of change are we going to have?\n', 'Are we going to build a stronger, fairer, better country or are we going to fear the future and each other? I sure hope not. That is not the America that I believe we are.\n', ""And so here is what I want to ask you to do. I want you to talk to your friends and your family and your neighbors. Michigan is one of these states that doesn't have early voting. I've been all over the country going to states that are already voting. In fact, I don't know. About 31 to 32-3 million people have already voted in those states. But Michigan votes on Tuesday.\n"", ""And I imagine – I imagine there are – some of you know people who say they're going to vote for Donald Trump. Right? I know. I know. I understand that. I mean, I would hope you would try to stage an intervention before it's too late. But maybe you could ask them with you to imagine, imagine January 20th, 2017. And imagine that my opponent is taking the oath of office in front of the Capitol. Imagine having a president who demeans women and mocks the disabled, who insults African Americans and Latinos and Muslims, who personally engages in busting unions and preventing people from having the right to bargain collectively. Now, the truth is we really don't have to imagine what that would be like because everything he has said and done, both in his career and in this campaign, tells you what could happen.\n"", ""Now, Michelle Obama, who says so many wise and wonderful things, she said the presidency doesn't change who you are; it reveals who you are. And I think we've seen who Donald Trump is.\n"", 'Maya Angelou, another great American, Maya Angelou said, when someone shows you who he is, believe him the first time. And if my opponent were to win, we would have a president who has only ever been in it for himself.\n', ""Just last year, he said again it wouldn't have mattered if we had rescued the auto industry or let it go bankrupt. What is he talking about? I'm proud that President Obama saved the auto industry. And I'm even prouder that because of the hard work of people in Detroit and across Michigan and the Midwest, the U.S. auto industry just had its best year ever.\n"", ""If Donald wins the election, we'd have a president who wants to ban every Muslim in the world from coming to visit the United States. We are a country founded on religious freedom. That runs contrary to our Constitution. We would have a president who has said repeatedly that he thinks the lives of black people are all about crime and poverty and despair. He has no idea about the strength of the black church and the vibrancy of black-owned businesses and the excellence of historically black colleges and universities. He seems to know nothing about the rise of a new generation of black activists and the success of black leaders in every field. I think he needs a visit from Reverend Wendell Anthony, don't you?\n"", ""Yesterday in North Carolina I was honored to stand with a woman named Mae Brown Wiggins. Decades ago, she was a hard-working nurse in New York City. She was looking for an apartment that she could afford to rent. But Donald Trump and his father, Fred, turned her away. You see, whenever African Americans tried to rent Trump apartments, their application was marked with a 'C,' C for colored. And that didn't sit very well with Mae, so she went to the authorities, and eventually the Department of Justice sued the to us for housing discrimination. And although they settled, they wouldn't change. So the government had to take them back to court. That's a pattern. This is what happens time and time again with my opponent. If he were to win, he would be in charge of the Federal Housing Department. If he doesn't respect all Americans now, how can we trust him to serve all Americans in the future?\n"", ""He has such a casual disregard of our Constitution. He doesn't seem to understand the rule of law, that we really are a nation of laws, not men. Here's the latest example. There was a terrible crime back in 1990 in New York City. It was called the Central Park Five. Maybe some of you have heard of it. There were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14. They were wrongfully convinced, and they were in prison where they spent years. Donald Trump took out full-page ads calling for the death penalty for the kids. And even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence and someone else confessed to that terrible crime, Trump actually said they should still be in prison. It doesn't matter if you're innocent. If he decides that you should be in prison or you should be locked up. No wonder he admired Vladimir Putin, because that's exactly what Putin does to his people.\n"", ""So we can't trust him with our Constitution. We can't trust him to obey the rule of law. He has shown us who he is. Now we have to decide who we are. So let me paint you a different picture. Here is what we're going to do together if we win this election on Tuesday night.\n"", ""We have three big challenges. Number one, we got to get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top. Number two, we've got to keep our country safe, and we have to work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence toward peace and prosperity. Number three, we've got to bring our country together. We have got to overcome these divides. We have to heal our nation. And I hope that you will help me meet all three of those challenges.\n"", ""I have said repeatedly that we're going to take on discrimination and bigotry because any time we hold somebody back, it can lead to holding other people back. We can't accept as normal what we're seeing across our country because of his campaign. A church in Mississippi was burned this week. Someone painted 'Vote Trump' on the side and then set it on fire. We can't let – we can't let that happen. What happened in Flint, Michigan should not be normal or acceptable. Our kids should be guaranteed clean air and clean water. Those are basics. We've got to do everything we can to make sure that we take care of our children.\n"", ""And it's important for us to recognize that when I talk about getting the economy to work for everybody, that means I want the biggest jobs program since World War II – infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, clean, renewable energy technology. Some people say we can't do that. Well, I'm telling you, they're wrong. They're wrong. We have the best workers, the most productive workers. We're going to give them more to work on, more products to produce. And we're going to do more for small business because small business is the backbone of so many communities. And I want everybody to have the chance to succeed in America. That means we're going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and replace it with the cradle-to-college pipeline.\n"", ""And we're going to make sure that every child has a chance to go to a good school with good teachers, no matter what zip code that child lives in. And I want to start with our youngest kids, with pre-kindergarten programs. And then I want to be a good partner with our teachers. We've got to have high expectation and get results in helping our children. And I want to be sure that we put technical education back into high school because there are good jobs out there waiting for young people with the skills to do them.\n"", ""It'll be important that we create an environment in which our police and our communities can work together and trust each other. I believe we are safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law. And that's what we're going to work for.\n"", ""We're also going to take common-sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives. This has nothing to do with the scare tactics coming from my opponent. Have you seen he's starting to wear a camo hat now? Really. We are going to work with responsible gun owners who understand that we've got to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them in the first place.\n"", ""And while we create more safe communities, we want to invest in those communities. I want to continue the good work that our past two Democratic Presidents have done, one named Clinton, one named Obama. And I want to be a really strong partner. I'll compete a little with them. I want to be a really strong partner with Detroit and other cities that are on the way back up to make sure you get the investment and the support, the housing, and the jobs that you need.\n"", ""But we also have to make sure our economy is fairer. That's why I believe we should raise the national minimum wage, because people who work full time should not be left in poverty. And isn't it finally time to guarantee equal pay for women? This is not a women's issue. If you have a wife, a mother, a daughter, or a sister who works, it's your issue. It's a family issue. And every time I talk about wanting to have affordable childcare, paid family leave, equal pay for women, the other side accuses me of playing the women's card. I'll tell you what, if standing up for equal pay is playing the women's card, then deal me in.\n"", ""And one of the other big challenges we're going to take on – I am so excited about this. I am really proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran because it was a campaign about issues. And what we decided after it was over is how we could work together to make sure that everybody who wants to go to college can afford not just to start but actually to graduate. So we came up with a plan that if you go to a public college or university, you will go tuition-free if your family makes less than $125,000 a year. And it will be debt-free for everybody above that so you don't go into debt. And for people who already have student debt, we're going to help you pay it down and pay it off to get out from under it. And I want especially to support historically black colleges and universities that have done so much to bring forth a leadership cadre in our country.\n"", ""Now, this is just some of what we are offering in this campaign, because we really believe you need to look at what will happen after the election. I had a friend say to me the other day, 'People are just frustrated and angry.' I get that. I understand that. We had the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression in '08 and '09. Millions of people lost their jobs, millions lost their homes, family wealth was wiped out. That is a trauma and people are still suffering and still climbing back from that. I get it. But I learned a long time ago from my late mother, anger is not a plan. Right? Be angry, vent about it, and then roll up your sleeves and get to work. That's what I will do. That's why we've put this all down. It's on our website, hillaryclinton.com. It's in a book that Tim Kaine and I put out called 'Stronger Together.' Because not only do I want you to know what I will try to do as your president; I want you to hold me accountable. I want you, when I come back to Detroit, which I will do when I travel around Michigan, which I will do, I want you to say, 'Well, how's it going getting those new jobs started? How much progress are we making on making sure college is affordable?' I believe in making lists. Maybe it's a women's thing. My husband said – once said to me one time, 'You have lists of your lists.' Well, I do because I want to know what we're going to get done and how we can make progress together.\n"", 'And ultimately, this election really is about the kind of country we want for our kids, and in my case now, my grandkids. Are we really a nation that believes in freedom and justice for all?""\n', 'Audience: ""Yes.""\n', 'Clinton: ""Are we really a nation that recognizes our best years can still be ahead of us if we make up our minds to have that be our goal? I believe we can do this together. My opponent at his convention said, \'I alone can fix it.\' Well, no, nobody alone does anything. When our founders met in Philadelphia, it wasn\'t one person creating our country. It was many people working together and fighting a revolution to get that democracy and then to fight for civil rights and voting rights and workers\' rights and women\'s rights and LGBT rights. None of them – none of them were won by one person alone. The American labor movement didn\'t happen because somebody one day said, \'I alone can make it happen.\' It took millions of people in every one of these movements marching and speaking out and sitting in. Barack Obama wasn\'t put into the White House by one person alone. It took everybody working and organizing, and yes, voting. That is how progress happens in America.\n', ""So really, it all comes down to you, my friends. You have to vote. Our progress is on the line. Everything that has happened up until this point is on the line. I'm ready to defend and build on the progress that we've made. I'm proud I was a member of President Obama's cabinet. I'm proud that – he and I are friends. But he knows and I know that American leadership, American presidents, it's like running a relay. You do your very best, and then you pass off the baton and you just hope that the person you pass it off to doesn't drop to the ground or doesn't turn around and run back the way we came from, which is what my opponent is promising to do.\n"", ""Now, I've told the President that when he hands off the baton that he's going to have to bend over. He's a lot taller than I am. But I'm excited about what we can do. I know this has been a tough campaign. I've got people coming up to me saying they've got migraines they never had before. They have stomachaches that they don't know what they're going to do with. I get it. It has been in many ways a really tough campaign, but I'll tell you what. Michigan, you can make the difference.\n"", ""All I'm asking you is talk to your friends, talk to your family, talk to your coworkers, talk to everybody.

That is clearly the right answer because we have a really important election tomorrow.\n', ""The choice in this election could not be clearer. And I know that for many people, you've gone back and forth, you've thought about what to do, and I really respect that. But let me say this. Let me say this. This election is basically between division and unity in our country.\n"", ""It's between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon who could put everything at risk. It is between an economy that works for everyone or one that is even more stacked for those at the top. And I want each and every one of you to be thinking through about all the issues that you care about. Because although my name and my opponents name will be on the ballot, those issues, and those values, are on the ballot as well.\n"", 'And as you think about what you care about and what you want your future to look like you have to recognize this is a consequential election. I have been privileged to know a lot of our presidents over the past decades, and people who ran for president. I was privileged to know as a college student, Gerald Ford.\n', ""In fact, I had an internship with the House Republican Conference Committee, which he headed, after my junior year in college. So when I say I've gotten to know a lot of our presidents, and people who've run for president, it goes back a ways. And here's what I want you to understand. I didn't agree with everything they did or said. Even the Democrats. We had differences and politics and policies and sometimes on principle, but I never doubted, I never doubted that they were fit to serve as our president and commander-in-chief.\n"", ""That's why this election is so different. And it's why so many Republicans have spoken out to endorse me and support me, and who have taken very courageous stands against the nominee of their own party. Because they believe that we must put country ahead of party when it comes to this election.\n"", 'I was at Kent State, in Ohio, last week and I was introduced by a gentleman by the name of Bruce Blair. And Mr. Blair had served in the Air Force, he was a young officer assigned to be what was called a launch officer. That meant he served his time every day sitting in a bunker where the controls for launching nuclear weapons were housed. And his job - imagine the responsibility. A young Air Force officer in his twenties, waiting to hear whether or not an order is given for him to launch nuclear weapons.\n', 'And Bruce Blair explained that there is no appeal from a president\'s order to do that. The joint chiefs of our military forces can\'t say, ""No, don\'t do it."" There\'s no veto from Congress or anyone else. And the time between the order being given and the actual launch is four minutes.\n', ""So after watching this election Mr. Blair began contacting others who had served in this incredibly responsible position to share his concerns about what he was hearing and seeing. And several dozen of them - I'd never met them before - several dozen of them wrote a letter explaining why they could never support Donald Trump to be our commander-in-chief.\n"", 'The awesome responsibility that is housed in one person is something I want you to think about between now and the time you vote. Because I will pledge to you that I will exercise the greatest care and responsibility in all of the powers invested in the office of the presidency.\n', 'I also want to pose to you a contrast in visions. Did any of you see the debates? First of all, I did stand for four and a half hours with Donald Trump on the stage, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be president.\n', ""But I have to say, in addition to that, there were so many things that he said that of course I sometimes was surprised by. But the theme that ran through much of his rhetoric was the presentation of a dark and divisive vision for America. Now I have to tell you, I know we've got problems. I've spent 18 months traveling around our country talking to - by now - hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people, hearing what's on people's minds. We've got challenges but America's always had challenges. And since when do we become pessimistic and not able to think about what we can do to overcome those challenges and solve those problems together?\n"", ""I often didn't recognize the country that Donald Trump was describing. Because from my perspective, looking back at our history, we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us. And you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America that will set the stage for an even better future.\n"", ""And I want to say especially to the students who are here - I really believe that America's best days are still ahead of us if we reach for them together.\n"", 'Make no mistake. Our core values are being tested in this election. But my faith in our future has never been stronger. Last night in Manchester, New Hampshire, I was introduced by Mr. Khizr Khan.\n', 'Some of you know or remember that his son, Captain Khan, serving in the United States Army, was killed serving in Iraq. And like at the Democratic Convention this summer, he spoke powerfully about what America means to him. And how we have to defend our values and our Constitution that are the envy of the rest of the world. People look at us with yearning. They see that we are a beacon of freedom, hope and opportunity for people, right here, at home.\n', 'When I heard Mr. Khan speak at the convention, and I heard him again last night, I was so touched because what he said exhibited a love of our country. He said that when he started hearing Donald Trump speak, and all of the things he said about so many people, not only Muslims but African-Americans and Latinos and POWs and women and so many people - when he heard it he couldn\'t help but think as he walked around his house - he has a room where his son\'s medals - he got the Bronze Star, he got the Purple Heart - the flag that was draped on his coffin - is respectfully presented in the box that he was given it in. And he thought to himself, ""Would there be any room for my son in Donald Trump\'s America?""\n', 'Think about that for a minute. Because every single one of us has something to contribute. To this great country. We are already great but we can be greater. And we will be greater.\n', ""I love our country and I believe in the American people, and I know there is nothing we can't do when we make up our minds. Throughout our history, generations of Americans have risen together to meet the tests of their time. They defended democracy. They built the greatest middle class the world has ever known. They marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers' rights and union rights, for LGBT rights, rights for people with disabilities.\n"", ""And now, now we've got to come together and we have to prove we can meet the chal-lenges of our time.

Jobs in infrastructure. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems.\n', ""These are jobs we need doing in American and these are jobs that cannot be exported. They've got to be done right here in Michigan and across our country.\n"", 'And we are going to invest in new jobs in advanced manufacturing. I am not one of these folks who think, ""We just can\'t make it in America anymore."" And I\'ll tell you why. Because if we have a plan and we actually commit to fulfilling that plan, we can lead the world in precision machining, in 3-D printing. We\'re not competing for low-wage jobs, we\'re competing with Germany for high manufacturing, high- skilled jobs.\n', 'And we are going to have clean, renewable energy jobs as a way to fight climate change. As you heard, my opponent chose to make many of his products overseas. And as I pointed out in the last debate, he buys cheap Chinese steel and aluminum instead of good American steel, made by American steel workers.\n', ""He's gone all over this country, and he's gone all over Michigan, talking about how he's gonna really get more jobs and he's going to bring back what used to be there. Well I'll tell you what. Look at his record, don't just listen to his rhetoric.\n"", ""Because I have a different idea. We're going to invest in America again. And for every-body who is frustrated, and anxious, and maybe even angry because they feel left out, left behind, that America's not working the way it should - I understand that. I under-stand that. I represented upstate New York for eight years, and I saw first hand a lot of the loss of jobs and factories, picking up and moving out.\n"", ""But I also realized that anger is not a plan. You've got to come together and figure out what is it we're gonna do to bring new jobs back and create more opportunity for people.\n"", ""And I'll just tell you that I believe that we've got to defend the American worker's right to organize and bargain for better wages and benefits.\n"", ""We're gonna get incomes rising here in western Michigan and across this state. And we're also gonna do more to help small business. My dad was a small businessman. He worked really hard. He ran a printing plant that printed fabrics for draperies, and I would from time to time help him out. You take a silkscreen, you put it down on the long table, you pour the paint in, you do the squeegee, you pick it up - it wasn't automated, we were the automaters - and you'd go all the way down to one table, you'd go to the other table. So I know how hard people in small business work.\n"", 'And I also know something else. Donald Trump made a lot of money off the backs of small business people and contractors by stiffing them and refusing to pay his bills. And I have said, ""I am sure glad my dad never got a contract from Donald Trump, because we could not have afforded that.""\n', ""But it's not just enough to grow the economy. We have to make it fairer. And if you believe we need a fairer economy then you have to vote. I think the best antidote for whatever ails a person is a good job. I believe in hard work. That's how I was raised. But I also believe that if you work hard and you work full time you shouldn't still be in poverty at the end of the year. And I'm gonna raise the national minimum wage.\n"", ""And one of the things I've heard all over America, especially from young families, really from all families but particularly young families, is how hard it is to do so many of the things that are expected - like where do you find affordable quality childcare? In lots of states, it's more expensive than college tuition. We're gonna get the cost of childcare down. We're going to have a paid family leave program so that when you have a sick relative or you're sick you won't lose your job.\n"", 'I saw the folks over there holding up the Tim Kaine sign and I really appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you. I got to tell you - Tim and I were in Pittsburgh last month, with a big crowd, and we couldn\'t get everybody in, like today, so Tim went out to say hello to people and he saw a woman holding a baby, probably about three years old. And he stopped to talk to her and she said, ""I came here because I wanted to tell you, and to tell Hillary Clinton, what happened to me."" She said that, ""I had my baby, it was a hard labor and delivery and I needed some time off. And I called by boss and said the doctors want me to take some time off and so I won\'t be in for - I think she said two weeks - and they said, ""OK. You\'re fired.""\n', ""That is legal in America, still. And what that does is to say that - wait a minute, do we really value children? Do we really value families? And we've got to have a system that is fair to employers and fair to employees because you got to be able to balance work and family in today's America.\n"", ""And then finally, I think it is way past time to guarantee equal pay for women's work.\n"", ""And you know I gotta say - this always gets a huge round of applause, as you can tell - but this is not just a woman's issue. It's a family issue. If you have a wife, a mother, a sister, a daughter, who's in the work force, you want her to be paid what she deserves to be paid to help you and your family.\n"", ""Just about everything I've said so far my opponent disagrees with. And whenever I talk about affordable childcare, and paid family leave, and equal pay - he says I'm playing the woman's card and you know what I say, if that's the case? Then deal me in.\n"", 'And here\'s what else I want you to know. It\'s fair to ask, ""How are you going to pay for that?"" That\'s not only fair, that\'s necessary to ask. Because I want to be a good steward of your tax dollars just as I expect you\'re a good steward of your family budget. I have proposed a very simple formula. I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year.\n', ""And for small businesses, we're gonna cut your taxes because I know a lot of small businesses need that kind of tax relief. So instead, we're going where the money is, to the millionaires and the billionaires and the big corporations.\n"", 'And that is in stark contrast to what Donald Trump has proposed. His whole economic plan is cut trillions of dollars in taxes from millionaires and billionaires and corporations. That is trickle-down economics on steroids. I profoundly disagree. I think the way you build an economy is from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down.\n', ""When you think about it, Donald hasn't paid anything for 20 years. He's paid zero to support our military, our vets, Pell grants for students here at Grand Valley, our high-ways - and I am still pondering, I am just pondering how anybody can lose a billion dollars in one year.\n"", ""Especially when you're running casinos. I do not understand that. But that will be one of the mysteries in this campaign because he's not going to release his tax returns now and the time you start voting. And that sort of suggests there must be something really terrible in those tax returns because everybody else for more than 40 years has released them.\n"", ""So, we'll still wonder. But what we know is his economic approach will cost us jobs, not create jobs. And we can't afford that. We need to keep building. We have recovered from the worst financial crash since the Great Depression but we're not where we need to be yet. The last thing we need is a failed economic policy coming back in and pushing us back down. And depriving people of the jobs that we want to create.\n"", 'And if you believe all of our kids should have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip code they live in then you have to vote.\n', ""And if you believe college should be affordable you have to vote. I've got to say I am proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. It was a campaign about ideas and issues, not insults. And when it was over, we actually got together. What a novel idea. We wanted to figure out how we can work together to actually produce on some of the goals that we both shared. So Bernie and I worked on this plan together.\n"", ""Public colleges and universities should be tuition-free for everyone who makes less than a $125,000 a year. And they should be debt-free for everyone else because nobody should go into debt. And if you have gone into debt, if you're among the millions of Americans who are struggling - as I see some hands pointing in the air - paying back your student debt, we are going to help you pay it down and pay it off.\n"", 'It makes no sense at all. We have interest rates that are really low right now. Buy a car for what, 1 or 2 percent. You can buy a house for 3,4 percent. There are so many people who are paying 8, 10, 12, higher - 8, 10, 12 percent interest - how much? Twelve point seven. Fourteen point one. I got to tell you friends. That is outrageous. The federal government should not be making money off of sending kids to college.\n', ""I can't wait to roll up my sleeves with Debbie and Bernie and we're gonna get to work right after this election if I am fortunate enough to win.\n"", ""Look. Working for children and families has been the cause of my life, but it's never been more important than it is right now. And that has to be our mission together. Doing all we can to help every American, and especially every young American and every child in America to have the chance to live up to their God-given potential. I will wake up every single day in the White House trying to figure out what I can do to make that a reality for you.\n"", ""So after tomorrow the work will begin, and one of the highest priorities that I feel an obligation to address is how we bring our country together. A lot of people say we've got to heal our country, or as the Bible says repair the breach. Because we have so much divisiveness right now. We've got to start listening to each other. Respecting each other. I know it is unusual, I admit, for somebody running for president, especially the day before an election, but I've been saying this for months. To say that we need more of two things right now.\n"", 'We need more love and kindness in America.\n', 'I don\'t know about you, I don\'t know about you but I bet everyone of us has received a kindness and maybe, I hope, we\'ve all extended one. I am standing here today because my mother, who was abandoned by her parents, rejected by her grandparents, went to work at the age of 14 as a maid, and a babysitter, was extended kindness. Not by those who should have loved her, but by others. The first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch, who began bringing extra food. The woman whose house she went to work in who knew that my mother wanted to go to high school. She would have been a freshman in high school when she had to leave her grandparents\' home and she got this job. And that woman said, ""I know you want to go to high school. If you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school, but you\'ll have to come back because we\'ll need you in the late afternoon.""\n', 'Now that may sound harsh to say to a 14-year old but to my mother it was a gift. I tell you this because we all have to start thinking about how we want to be treated and what that means about how we treat others. And …\n', ""There's a version of the golden rule in every major religion. And it is a reminder that every one of us gets knocked down. The question as my mother would say is are you gonna get back up? And for people in our country who feel like they've been knocked down and nobody cares, nobody's paying attention, here's what I want you to know. If you give me the honor of being your president I'm gonna do everything I can to get this country and everybody in it back up on our feet moving forward together.\n"", 'Because I want to be a president for all Americans.\n', ""Democrats, Republicans, Independents.

He was awarded Bronze Star and the Purple Heart, but as Mr. Khan said, ""When you listen to all the people that my opponent has insulted and denigrated, would there be a place in Donald Trump\'s America for Captain Khan?"" The Khan family gives me hope because they truly believe in the values of this great country of ours, and they have stood up holding the Constitution as he did at the convention to say, ""People around the world cherish this Constitution, believe in our values. It\'s a source of hope for billions of people. We will never, ever let that go, and we never let someone rip it away in the kind of negative, divisive, hateful campaign that we have seen from the other side in this election.""\n', ""Sometimes when I hear my opponent speak, I don't recognize the country he's talking about. That doesn't mean we don't have problems and challenges, it doesn't mean that we don't have to do more to help people across our country get better economic opportunities. Of course, we do. But boy, I believe we can do it. I love our country. I believe in the American people. I know what we are capable of. Throughout of history, generations of Americans have risen together to meet the tests of their time. They defended democracy, built the greatest middle class that the world has ever seen, marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers rights and women's rights, LGBT rights, and rights for people with disabilities.\n"", 'Tomorrow, we face the test of our time, will we be coming together as a nation or getting further apart? Will we set goals that all of us can help meet? Or will we turn on each other and pit one group of Americans against another?\n', 'Now, our names will be on the ballot tomorrow, but those values and every issue you care about will be there, too. What kind of country do we want, and I particularly think about this for young people as I look at this crowd and see so many students and young Americans that deserve the same opportunities that many of us were given. We will make sure they are available because if you think about what it takes to have a thriving America, it comes down to a couple of key issues.\n', ""If you believe that America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote. We're going to make the biggest investment in good-paying jobs since World War II, jobs in infrastructure, small business, clean energy, advanced manufacturing. We're going to actually deliver on that unlike my opponent, who makes his products mostly overseas, buys cheap Chinese steel and aluminum instead of what's made by American steelworkers right here in Pennsylvania. We're going to invest in America, and we're especially going to invest in communities that are left out and left behind. We're going to stand up for the right of workers to organize and bargain. We're going to get incomes rising across America.\n"", ""And if you believe we need a fairer economy as I do, then we're going to raise the national minimum wage, because no one who works full time in America should still be in poverty. And we're going to do more to support working families with affordable child care, paid leave, and finally, equal pay for women's work.\n"", ""I've got to tell you, this always get's about the biggest applause ever because fundamentally, we know it's not fair, but it's also about families. If you have a mother, a wife, a sister or a daughter who's working, you don't want her shortchanged, do you? Now, when I talk about equal pay and all of these other family issues, my opponent says I'm playing the woman's card. Well, you know what I say: deal me in.\n"", 'If you believe all our kids should have good schools and good teachers, no matter what zip code they live in, then you have to vote. If you believe we can make college affordable for every young American, then you have got to vote.\n', ""I've got to say, I was very proud of the primary campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. It was a campaign on issues and ideas, not insults. And after it was over, he and I got together, and we came up with this plan. Public colleges and universities should be tuition-free for everyone who makes less than $125,000 a year. And it should be debt free for everybody else. I don't think you should go into this massive debt to get your education. It's good for you, it's good for your families, it's good for our country, and we're going to make it affordable for everyone. And for the millions of Americans already struggling with student debt, we're going to ease that burden. We're going to get those interest rates down, we're going to give you a different way of repaying it as a percentage of your income, not tied to a six, eight, 10 percent interest rate, and you're never going to have to pay more than you can afford.\n"", ""You see, I think there are a lot of positive things to get excited about. And I think the agenda we've put forth in this campaign is one that will really give everybody hope. You see, working for children and families has been the cause of my life, but it's never been more important than it is right now.\n"", ""So this has to be our mission together – doing all we can to help every American, especially every young American and especially every child, to have the chance to live up to your God-given potential. Because when it's all said and done, that's what matters the most. Have you helped somebody else? Have you reached out and tried to ease somebody's burden? We do it individually.\n"", ""My mother got through a neglected, abandoned childhood because people showed her kindness. Her own parents didn't want her. Her own grandparents didn't want her. But that first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat, brought extra food every single day to make sure my mother had something to eat. And when she was 14 and had to go out and find a job to support herself and got a job as a maid and a babysitter in somebody's home, she was just relieved that she had somewhere to live and that she could support herself. But the mother of that home understood my mother wanted to go to high school and so she said, 'Dorothy, if you get up early and get your chores done, you can go to high school. You'll have to come right back because I'll need you, but you can do it.'\n"", ""And look, that sounds harsh to our ears, telling a 14 year old, 'Okay, you can go to high school but you have to come right back and you have to work on both sides of it.' But to my mother, it was a blessing. So when I think about what so many people have gone through to give us the opportunities that we had had, and I'm speaking for myself, my mother gave me the resilience, the grit, the get up and go. She told me, 'Everyone gets knocked down. What matters is if you get back up.' And we had a lot of Americans knocked down because of the Great Recession, didn't we? Millions of jobs were lost, millions of homes were lost. Family wealth was wiped out, savings account, 401K's, everything that people had worked so hard for.\n"", ""Well we've dug ourselves out of the hole and now we need to get up, and we've got to make sure we don't leave anybody behind. I see this man here standing with a sign: 'Coal Miners for Hillary,' and I'll tell you sir, I know how hard times are. And as I have said, and you can take it to the bank, I will not forget you and I will do everything I can to help people who have given so much, worked so hard throughout their lives for generations to build this country. We are not going to forget any American! But I can't do any of this without your help tomorrow.\n"", ""This election is going to really set the course of our country. There's no doubt in my mind. Tonight, I'll be in Philadelphia with President Obama and Michelle and I so appreciate how hard they worked for me, but it's not for me. It's for us.\n"", ""When President Obama came into office, put yourself in his shoes -- this young, dynamic, first African-American elected to become President of the United States. And what does he find? He finds the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, that's what he finds.\n"", ""Wow, those were hard, hard times. I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for making sure we didn't go even deeper in the ditch we were in. But make no mistake: there were reasons we ended up in that ditch. It didn't happen by accident. We had huge tax cuts on the wealthy, the administration in office took their eyes off the financial markets and we know what happened. They ignored the pressures in the mortgage markets and we know what happened.\n"", ""Elections have consequences for everything we care about. And that's why we've got to each and every one of you put down your stake in our future. If the lines are long tomorrow, please wait. In early voting, we have had people waiting in line for two and three hours and there have been reporters and others going up and down the line, asking them, all types of Americans, not one type -- all types, 'Why are you here?' 'Because my future depends on it,' they say.\n"", ""So tomorrow is the election, but that is just beginning. We have to heal this country. We have to bring people together, listen and respect each other. Now I know it's unusual for somebody running for president to say this, I started saying this months ago, because I was literally meeting who were scared about what they were hearing in this election. I've known a lot of the Republicans who've run for president been elected president in recent history, I didn't agree with them on everything, obviously we had our differences, but I didn't doubt that they were fit to serve as president. This election is different. This person is temperamentally unqualified, experientially unqualified to be president and so many people know that.\n"", 'So I think we do need more love and kindness, right? We have to got to rise above all of this hate filled rhetoric, all of these insults and scapegoating and finger pointing and insulting. I want to be a president for all Americans. Not just some. I want to be the president for Democrats, Republicans and Independents. I want to be the president for those who vote for and those who vote against me. I want to represent everybody. Because I know we have a role to play in building a better future.\n', ""So it starts tomorrow. If you don't know where to vote, go to IWillVote.com. You can get all the information you need, the polls will be open from 7 AM to 8 PM. We are on track, as I said, to have a huge turnout. But we can only do that if all of you make up your minds, you bring all your friends, everybody you know, to make sure your voices are heard.\n"", ""This is a historic, historic election and we're going to do everything we can, not only to win, but then immediately to get to work. And I especially invite anyone who wants to volunteer for the next 24 hours, go to hillaryclinton.com, text join, J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6, stop by one of our offices. We would love to see you. Because when your kids and grandkids ask what you in the future what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, you'll be able to say: you voted for a stronger, fairer, better America where we build bridges, not walls. And where we finally prove once and for all that, yes, love trumps hate. Thank you.""]"

In a nation that is good at so many things, but that has made it uniquely difficult for women to be elected to federal office, she became the first major party nominee as a woman to be president and last night won the popular vote of Americans for the president. [applause]', 'That is an amazing accomplishment. It is an amazing accomplishment. I\'m proud of Hillary Clinton because in the words of Langston Hughes, she\'s ""held fast to dreams."" She was inspired at a young age to an epiphany that if families and children do well, that\'s the best barometer of whether society does well. In everything she\'s done, she\'s focused on that.', ""We know she would have made history as a president in one sense, but we never have had a president who's made their whole career about the empowerment of families and children. And I was as excited about that in the Oval Office as I was excited to have my friend Hillary there and make history as the first woman president."", ""I'm excited and proud of Hillary because she has built such a wonderful team. There is a...[applause]"", ""There's a beautiful and kind of comical parable in the New Testament about a vineyard owner who hires people to work and says I'm going to pay you this for a full day. Then he hires people at noon, I'm going to pay you the same thing for the half day. Then he hires people one hours work, I'm going to pay you the same. And those who started earlier in the day said hold on, we don't like this, that you're treating everybody who came late just as well as you're treating us."", ""I'm going to tell you something, here's what I've come to know so well about Hillary. The team that she has assembled over the years of people that are so deeply loyal to her because she's so deeply loyal to them is inspiring. But I've seen that same degree of loyalty and compassion and sensitivity extended to the most recent folks who have joined the team, the folks who came to the vineyard with just one hour to go. Her loyalty and compassion of Hillary and Bill to people, if you're with you you're with you. And that is just something so remarkable."", ""And finally, I'm proud of Hillary because she loves this country. [applause]"", ""Nobody — nobody had to wonder about Hillary Clinton, whether she would accept an outcome of an election in our beautiful democracy. Nobody had to ask that question. Nobody had to doubt it. She knows our country for what it is. She knows the system that we have and its warts and blemishes. She's deeply in love with it and accepts it. She's been in battles before where if it didn't go her way she accepted it, but then woke up the next day and battled again for the dreams that she's held fast to. And that love of country is something that I think is obvious to everybody, obvious to everyone."", 'I want to thank Hillary Clinton for asking Anne and I to join this wild ride. We — about a week before she asked if I would be her running mate, Anne and I went up to Westchester and we sat down with Hillary and Bill and with Chelsea and Mark and with Charlotte and Aiden for about three hours of conversation to try to determine whether we would be the right people to be on the ticket.', 'And when we got in the car to head back to the airport after the three hour discussion, I said to Anne, ""Honey, I don\'t know whether we\'re going to be on this ticket or not, but I do know this, we\'re going to remember that three hours for the rest of our life."" And now, we\'ve — we\'ll remember 105 days that we\'ve had with this fantastic couple of public servants and all of you for the rest of our life.', 'I\'ll just say this.

[applause]', '""They kilt us but they ain\'t whupped us yet,"" because we know that the work remains. We know that the dreams of empowering families and children remain. And in that work, that important work that we have to do as a nation, it is so comforting even at a tough time to know that Hillary Clinton is somebody until her very last breath is going to be battling for the values that make this nation great and the values that we care so deeply about.', 'So now, please join me in welcoming Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Thank you, thank you so very much for being here and I love you all, too.', ""Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country.

[applause]', ""I know how disappointed you feel because I feel it too, and so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort. This is painful and it will be for a long time, but I want you to remember this. Our campaign was never about one person or even one election, it was about the country we love and about building an America that's hopeful, inclusive and big-hearted."", 'We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America and I always will. And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our president.

It also enshrines other things; the rule of law, the principle that we are all equal in rights and dignity, freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these values too and we must defend them.
