0,Donald J. Trump ,"January 02, 2021","[""White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Okay. Alright. Mr. President, everyone is on the line. This is Mark Meadows, the chief of staff. Just so we all are aware. On the line is secretary of state and two other individuals. Jordan and Mr. Germany with him. You also have the attorneys that represent the president, Kurt and Alex and Cleta Mitchell — who is not the attorney of record but has been involved — myself and then the president. So Mr. President, I'll turn it over to you."", ""The President. Okay, thank you very much. Hello Brad and Ryan and everybody. We appreciate the time and the call. So we've spent a lot of time on this, and if we could just go over some of the numbers, I think it's pretty clear that we won. We won very substantially in Georgia. You even see it by rally size, frankly. We'd be getting 25-30,000 people a rally, and the competition would get less than 100 people. And it never made sense."", ""But we have a number of things. We have at least 2 or 3 — anywhere from 250 to 300,000 ballots were dropped mysteriously into the rolls. Much of that had to do with Fulton County, which hasn't been checked. We think that if you check the signatures — a real check of the signatures going back in Fulton County — you'll find at least a couple of hundred thousand of forged signatures of people who have been forged. And we are quite sure that's going to happen."", ""Another tremendous number. We're going to have an accurate number over the next two days with certified accountants. But an accurate number will be given, but it's in the 50s of thousands — and that's people that went to vote and they were told they can't vote because they've already been voted for. And it's a very sad thing. They walked out complaining. But the number's large. We'll have it for you. But it's much more than the number of 11,779 that's — the current margin is only 11,779. Brad, I think you agree with that, right? That's something I think everyone — at least that's a number that everyone agrees on."", ""But that's the difference in the votes. But we've had hundreds of thousands of ballots that we're able to actually — we'll get you a pretty accurate number. You don't need much of a number because the number that in theory I lost by, the margin would be 11,779. But you also have a substantial numbers of people, thousands and thousands, who went to the voting place on November 3, were told they couldn't vote, were told they couldn't vote because a ballot had been put on their name. And you know that's very, very, very, very sad."", ""We had, I believe it's about 4,502 voters who voted but who weren't on the voter registration list, so it's 4,502 who voted, but they weren't on the voter registration roll, which they had to be. You had 18,325 vacant address voters. The address was vacant, and they're not allowed to be counted. That's 18,325."", ""Smaller number — you had 904 who only voted where they had just a P.O. — a post office box number — and they had a post office box number, and that's not allowed. We had at least 18,000 — that's on tape, we had them counted very painstakingly — 18,000 voters having to do with [name]. She's a vote scammer, a professional vote scammer and hustler [name]. That was the tape that's been shown all over the world that makes everybody look bad, you, me and everybody else."", ""Where they got — number one they said very clearly and it's been reported that they said there was a major water main break. Everybody fled the area. And then they came back, [name] and her daughter and a few people. There were no Republican poll watchers. Actually, there were no Democrat poll watchers, I guess they were them. But there were no Democrats, either, and there was no law enforcement. Late in the morning, early in the morning, they went to the table with the black robe and the black shield, and they pulled out the votes. Those votes were put there a number of hours before — the table was put there — I think it was, Brad, you would know, it was probably eight hours or seven hours before, and then it was stuffed with votes."", ""They weren't in an official voter box; they were in what looked to be suitcases or trunks, suitcases, but they weren't in voter boxes. The minimum number it could be because we watched it, and they watched it certified in slow motion instant replay if you can believe it, but slow motion, and it was magnified many times over, and the minimum it was 18,000 ballots, all for Biden."", ""You had out-of-state voters. They voted in Georgia, but they were from out of state, of 4,925. You had absentee ballots sent to vacant, they were absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses. They had nothing on them about addresses, that's 2,326."", 'And you had dropboxes, which is very bad. You had dropboxes that were picked up. We have photographs, and we have affidavits from many people.', ""I don't know if you saw the hearings, but you have dropboxes where the box was picked up but not delivered for three days. So all sorts of things could have happened to that box, including, you know, putting in the votes that you wanted. So there were many infractions, and the bottom line is, many, many times the 11,779 margin that they said we lost by — we had vast, I mean the state is in turmoil over this."", ""And I know you would like to get to the bottom of it, although I saw you on television today, and you said that you found nothing wrong. I mean, you know, and I didn't lose the state, Brad. People have been saying that it was the highest vote ever. There was no way. A lot of the political people said that there's no way they beat me. And they beat me. They beat me in the .\u2009.\u2009. As you know, every single state, we won every state. We won every statehouse in the country. We held the Senate, which is shocking to people, although we'll see what happens tomorrow or in a few days."", ""And we won the House, but we won every single statehouse, and we won Congress, which was supposed to lose 15 seats, and they gained, I think 16 or 17 or something. I think there's a now difference of five. There was supposed to be a difference substantially more. But politicians in every state, but politicians in Georgia have given affidavits and are going to that, that there was no way that they beat me in the election, that the people came out, in fact, they were expecting to lose, and then they ended up winning by a lot because of the coattails. And they said there's no way, that they've done many polls prior to the election, that there was no way that they won."", ""Ballots were dropped in massive numbers. And we're trying to get to those numbers and we will have them."", ""They'll take a period of time. Certified. But but they're massive numbers. And far greater than the 11,779."", 'The other thing, dead people. So dead people voted, and I think the number is close to 5,000 people. And they went to obituaries. They went to all sorts of methods to come up with an accurate number, and a minimum is close to about 5,000 voters.', ""The bottom line is, when you add it all up and then you start adding, you know, 300,000 fake ballots. Then the other thing they said is in Fulton County and other areas. And this may or may not be true .\u2009.\u2009. this just came up this morning, that they are burning their ballots, that they are shredding, shredding ballots and removing equipment. They're changing the equipment on the Dominion machines and, you know, that's not legal."", 'And they supposedly shredded I think they said 300 pounds of, 3,000 pounds of ballots. And that just came to us as a report today. And it is a very sad situation.', ""But Brad, if you took the minimum numbers where many, many times above the 11,779, and many of those numbers are certified, or they will be certified, but they are certified. And those are numbers that are there, that exist. And that beat the margin of loss, they beat it, I mean, by a lot, and people should be happy to have an accurate count instead of an election where there's turmoil."", ""I mean there's turmoil in Georgia and other places. You're not the only one, I mean, we have other states that I believe will be flipping to us very shortly. And this is something that — you know, as an example, I think it in Detroit, I think there's a section, a good section of your state actually, which we're not sure so we're not going to report it yet. But in Detroit, we had, I think it was, 139 percent of the people voted. That's not too good."", ""In Pennsylvania, they had well over 200,000 more votes than they had people voting. And that doesn't play too well, and the legislature there is, which is Republican, is extremely activist and angry. I mean, there were other things also that were almost as bad as that. But they had as an example, in Michigan, a tremendous number of dead people that voted. I think it was, I think, Mark, it was 18,000. Some unbelievably high number, much higher than yours, you were in the 4-5,000 category."", 'And that was checked out laboriously by going through, by going through the obituary columns in the newspapers.', ""So I guess with all of it being said, Brad, the bottom line, and provisional ballots, again, you know, you'll have to tell me about the provisional ballots, but we have a lot of people that were complaining that they weren't able to vote because they were already voted for. These are great people."", ""And, you know, they were shellshocked. I don't know if you call that provisional ballots. In some states, we had a lot of provisional ballot situations where people were given a provisional ballot because when they walked in on November 3 and they were already voted for."", ""So that's it. I mean, we have many, many times the number of votes necessary to win the state. And we won the state, and we won it very substantially and easily, and we're getting, we have, much of this is a very certified, far more certified than we need. But we're getting additional numbers certified, too. And we're getting pictures of dropboxes being delivered and delivered late. Delivered three days later, in some cases, plus we have many affidavits to that effect."", ""Meadows. So, Mr. President, if I might be able to jump in, and I'll give Brad a chance. Mr. Secretary, obviously there is, there are allegations where we believe that not every vote or fair vote and legal vote was counted, and that's at odds with the representation from the secretary of state's office."", ""What I'm hopeful for is there some way that we can, we can find some kind of agreement to look at this a little bit more fully? You know the president mentioned Fulton County."", ""But in some of these areas where there seems to be a difference of where the facts seem to lead, and so Mr. Secretary, I was hopeful that, you know, in the spirit of cooperation and compromise, is there something that we can at least have a discussion to look at some of these allegations to find a path forward that's less litigious?"", ""Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Well, I listened to what the president has just said. President Trump, we've had several lawsuits, and we've had to respond in court to the lawsuits and the contentions. We don't agree that you have won. And we don't — I didn't agree about the 200,000 number that you'd mentioned. I'll go through that point by point."", ""What we have done is we gave our state Senate about one and a half hours of our time going through the election issue by issue and then on the state House, the government affairs committee, we gave them about two and a half hours of our time, going back point by point on all the issues of contention. And then just a few days ago, we met with our U.S. congressmen, Republican congressmen, and we gave them about two hours of our time talking about this past election. Going back, primarily what you've talked about here focused in on primarily, I believe, is the absentee ballot process. I don't believe that you're really questioning the Dominion machines. Because we did a hand re-tally, a 100 percent re-tally of all the ballots, and compared them to what the machines said and came up with virtually the same result. Then we did the recount, and we got virtually the same result. So I guess we can probably take that off the table."", ""I don't think there's an issue about that."", ""The President. Well, Brad. Not that there's not an issue, because we have a big issue with Dominion in other states and perhaps in yours. But we haven't felt we needed to go there. And just to, you know, maybe put a little different spin on what Mark is saying, Mark Meadows, yeah we'd like to go further, but we don't really need to. We have all the votes we need."", ""You know, we won the state. If you took, these are the most minimal numbers, the numbers that I gave you, those are numbers that are certified, your absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses, your out-of-state voters, 4,925. You know when you add them up, it's many more times, it's many times the 11,779 number. So we could go through, we have not gone through your Dominion. So we can't give them blessing. I mean, in other states, we think we found tremendous corruption with Dominion machines, but we'll have to see."", ""But we only lost the state by that number, 11,000 votes, and 779. So with that being said, with just what we have, with just what we have, we're giving you minimal, minimal numbers. We're doing the most conservative numbers possible; we're many times, many, many times above the margin. And so we don't really have to, Mark, I don't think we have to go through .\u2009.\u2009."", 'Meadows. Right', ""The President. Because what's the difference between winning the election by two votes and winning it by half a million votes. I think I probably did win it by half a million. You know, one of the things that happened, Brad, is we have other people coming in now from Alabama and from South Carolina and from other states, and they're saying it's impossible for you to have lost Georgia. We won. You know in Alabama, we set a record, got the highest vote ever. In Georgia, we set a record with a massive amount of votes. And they say it's not possible to have lost Georgia."", ""And I could tell you by our rallies. I could tell you by the rally I'm having on Monday night, the place, they already have lines of people standing out front waiting. It's just not possible to have lost Georgia. It's not possible. When I heard it was close, I said there's no way. But they dropped a lot of votes in there late at night. You know that, Brad. And that's what we are working on very, very stringently. But regardless of those votes, with all of it being said, we lost by essentially 11,000 votes, and we have many more votes already calculated and certified, too."", ""And so I just don't know, you know, Mark, I don't know what's the purpose. I won't give Dominion a pass because we found too many bad things. But we don't need Dominion or anything else. We have won this election in Georgia based on all of this. And there's nothing wrong with saying that, Brad. You know, I mean, having the correct — the people of Georgia are angry. And these numbers are going to be repeated on Monday night. Along with others that we're going to have by that time, which are much more substantial even. And the people of Georgia are angry, the people of the country are angry. And there's nothing wrong with saying that, you know, that you've recalculated. Because the 2,236 in absentee ballots. I mean, they're all exact numbers that were done by accounting firms, law firms, etc. And even if you cut 'em in half, cut 'em in half and cut 'em in half again, it's more votes than we need."", 'Raffensperger. Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong. We talked to the congressmen, and they were surprised.', ""But they — I guess there was a person named Mr. Braynard who came to these meetings and presented data, and he said that there was dead people, I believe it was upward of 5,000. The actual number were two. Two. Two people that were dead that voted. So that's wrong."", 'The President. Well, Cleta, how do you respond to that? Maybe you tell me?', 'Attorney Cleta Mitchell. Well, I would say, Mr. Secretary, one of the things that we have requested and what we said was, if you look, if you read our petition, it said that we took the names and birth years, and we had certain information available to us. We have asked from your office for records that only you have, and so we said there is a universe of people who have the same name and same birth year and died.', ""But we don't have the records that you have. And one of the things that we have been suggesting formally and informally for weeks now is for you to make available to us the records that would be necessary —"", ""The President. But, Cleta, even before you do that, and not even including that, that's why I hardly even included that number, although in one state, we have a tremendous amount of dead people. So I don't know — I'm sure we do in Georgia, too. I'm sure we do in Georgia, too."", 'But we\'re so far ahead. We\'re so far ahead of these numbers, even the phony ballots of [name] , known scammer. You know the Internet? You know what was trending on the Internet? ""Where\'s [name]?"" Because they thought she\'d be in jail. ""Where\'s [name]?"" It\'s crazy, it\'s crazy. That was. The minimum number is 18,000 for [name] , but they think it\'s probably about 56,000, but the minimum number is 18,000 on the [name] night where she ran back in there when everybody was gone and stuffed, she stuffed the ballot boxes. Let\'s face it, Brad, I mean. They did it in slow motion replay magnified, right? She stuffed the ballot boxes. They were stuffed like nobody has ever seen them stuffed before.', ""So there's a term for it when it's a machine instead of a ballot box, but she stuffed the machine. She stuffed the ballot. Each ballot went three times, they were showing: Here's ballot No 1. Here it is a second time, third time, next ballot."", ""I mean, look. Brad. We have a new tape that we're going to release. It's devastating. And by the way, that one event, that one event is much more than the 11,000 votes that we're talking about. It's, you know, that one event was a disaster. And it's just, you know, but it was, it was something, it can't be disputed. And again, we have a version that you haven't seen, but it's magnified. It's magnified, and you can see everything. For some reason, they put it in three times, each ballot, and I don't know why. I don't know why three times. Why not five times, right? Go ahead."", ""Raffensperger. You're talking about the State Farm video. And I think it's extremely unfortunate that Rudy Giuliani or his people, they sliced and diced that video and took it out of context. The next day, we brought in WSB-TV, and we let them show, see the full run of tape, and what you'll see, the events that transpired are nowhere near what was projected by, you know —"", 'The President. But where were the poll watchers, Brad? There were no poll watchers there. There were no Democrats or Republicans. There was no security there.', ""It was late in the evening, late in the, early in the morning, and there was nobody else in the room. Where were the poll watchers, and why did they say a water main broke, which they did and which was reported in the newspapers? They said they left. They ran out because of a water main break, and there was no water main. There was nothing. There was no break. There was no water main break. But we're, if you take out everything, where were the Republican poll watchers, even where were the Democrat pollwatchers, because there were none."", 'And then you say, well, they left their station, you know, if you look at the tape, and this was, this was reviewed by professional police and detectives and other people, when they left in a rush, everybody left in a rush because of the water main, but everybody left in a rush. These people left their station.', ""When they came back, they didn't go to their station. They went to the apron, wrapped around the table, under which were thousands and thousands of ballots in a box that was not an official or a sealed box. And then they took those. They went back to a different station. So if they would have come back, they would have walked to their station, and they would have continued to work. But they couldn't do even that because that's illegal, because they had no Republican pollwatchers. And remember, her reputation is — she's known all over the Internet, Brad. She's known all over."", 'I\'m telling you, ""Where\'s [name] "" was one of the hot items .\u2009.\u2009. [name] They knew her. ""Where\'s [name]?"" So Brad, there can be no justification for that. And I, you know, I give everybody the benefit of the doubt. But that was — and Brad, why did they put the votes in three times? You know, they put \'em in three times.', 'Raffensperger. Mr. President, they did not put that. We did an audit of that, and we proved conclusively that they were not scanned three times.', 'The President. Where was everybody else at that late time in the morning? Where was everybody? Where were the Republicans? Where were the security guards? Were the people that were there just a little while before when everyone ran out of the room. How come we had no security in the room. Why did they run to the bottom of the table? Why do they run there and just open the skirt and rip out the votes. I mean, Brad. And they were sitting there, I think for five hours or something like that, the votes.', ""Raffensperger. Mr. President, we'll send you the link from WSB."", ""The President. I don't care about the link. I don't need it. Brad, I have a much better —"", ""Mitchell. I will tell you. I've seen the tape. The full tape. So has Alex. We've watched it. And what we saw and what we've confirmed in the timing is that they made everybody leave — we have sworn affidavits saying that. And then they began to process ballots. And our estimate is that there were roughly 18,000 ballots. We don't know that. If you know that .\u2009.\u2009."", 'The President. It was 18,000 ballots, but they used each one three times.', ""Mitchell. Well, I don't know about that."", 'The President. I do think we had ours magnified out.', ""Mitchell. I've watched the entire tape."", ""The President. Nobody can make a case for that, Brad. Nobody. I mean, look, you'd have to be a child to think anything other than that. Just a child."", 'Mitchell. How many ballots, Mr. Secretary, are you saying were processed then?', 'Raffensperger. We had GBI .\u2009.\u2009. investigate that.', 'General Counsel to the Georgia Secretary of State Ryan Germany. We had our — this is Ryan Germany. We had our law enforcement officers talk to everyone who was, who was there after that event came to light. GBI was with them as well as FBI agents.', ""The President. Well, there's no way they could — then they're incompetent. They're either dishonest or incompetent, okay?"", 'Mitchell. Well, what did they find?', ""The President. There's only two answers, dishonesty or incompetence. There's just no way. Look. There's no way. And on the other thing, I said too, there is no way. I mean, there's no way that these things could have been, you know, you have all these different people that voted, but they don't live in Georgia anymore. What was that number, Cleta? That was a pretty good number, too."", ""Mitchell. The number who have registered out of state after they moved from Georgia. And so they had a date when they moved from Georgia, they registered to vote out of state, and then it's like 4,500, I don't have that number right in front of me."", 'The President. And then they came back in, and they voted.', 'Mitchell. And voted. Yeah.', 'The President. I thought that was a large number, though. It was in the 20s.', ""Germany. We've been going through each of those as well, and those numbers that we got, that Ms. Mitchell was just saying, they're not accurate. Every one we've been through are people that lived in Georgia, moved to a different state, but then moved back to Georgia legitimately. And in many cases —"", 'The President. How may people do that? They moved out, and then they said, ""Ah, to hell with it, I\'ll move back."" You know, it doesn\'t sound like a very normal .\u2009.\u2009. you mean, they moved out, and what, they missed it so much that they wanted to move back in? It\'s crazy.', ""Germany. They moved back in years ago. This was not like something just before the election. So there's something about that data that, it's just not accurate."", ""The President. Well, I don't know, all I know is that it is certified. And they moved out of Georgia, and they voted. It didn't say they moved back in, Cleta, did it?"", ""Mitchell. No, but I mean, we're looking at the voter registration. Again, if you have additional records, we've been asking for that, but you haven't shared any of that with us. You just keep saying you investigated the allegations."", ""The President. Cleta, a lot of it you don't need to be shared. I mean, to be honest, they should share it. They should share it because you want to get to an honest election."", ""I won this election by hundreds of thousands of votes. There's no way I lost Georgia. There's no way. We won by hundreds of thousands of votes. I'm just going by small numbers, when you add them up, they're many times the 11,000. But I won that state by hundreds of thousands of votes."", ""Do you think it's possible that they shredded ballots in Fulton County? Because that's what the rumor is. And also that Dominion took out machines. That Dominion is really moving fast to get rid of their, uh, machinery."", ""Do you know anything about that? Because that's illegal, right?"", 'Germany. This is Ryan Germany. No, Dominion has not moved any machinery out of Fulton County.', 'The President. But have they moved the inner parts of the machines and replaced them with other parts?', 'Germany. No.', 'The President. Are you sure, Ryan?', ""Germany. I'm sure. I'm sure, Mr. President."", 'The President. What about, what about the ballots. The shredding of the ballots. Have they been shredding ballots?', 'Germany. The only investigation that we have into that — they have not been shredding any ballots. There was an issue in Cobb County where they were doing normal office shredding, getting rid of old stuff, and we investigated that. But this stuff from, you know, from you know past elections.', 'The President. It doesn\'t pass the smell test because we hear they\'re shredding thousands and thousands of ballots, and now what they\'re saying, ""Oh, we\'re just cleaning up the office."" You know.', 'Raffensperger. Mr. President, the problem you have with social media, they — people can say anything.', ""The President. Oh this isn't social media. This is Trump media. It's not social media. It's really not; it's not social media. I don't care about social media. I couldn't care less. Social media is Big Tech. Big Tech is on your side, you know. I don't even know why you have a side because you should want to have an accurate election. And you're a Republican."", 'Raffensperger. We believe that we do have an accurate election.', ""The President. No, no you don't. No, no you don't. You don't have. Not even close. You're off by hundreds of thousands of votes. And just on the small numbers, you're off on these numbers, and these numbers can't be just — well, why wont? — Okay. So you sent us into Cobb County for signature verification, right? You sent us into Cobb County, which we didn't want to go into. And you said it would be open to the public. So we had our experts there, they weren't allowed into the room. But we didn't want Cobb County. We wanted Fulton County. And you wouldn't give it to us. Now, why aren't we doing signature — and why can't it be open to the public?"", ""And why can't we have professionals do it instead of rank amateurs who will never find anything and don't want to find anything? They don't want to find, you know they don't want to find anything. Someday you'll tell me the reason why, because I don't understand your reasoning, but someday you'll tell me the reason why. But why don't you want to find?"", 'Germany. Mr. President, we chose Cobb County —', ""The President. Why don't you want to find .\u2009.\u2009. What?"", 'Germany. Sorry, go ahead.', ""The President. So why did you do Cobb County? We didn't even request — we requested Fulton County, not Cobb County. Go ahead, please. Go ahead."", ""Germany. We chose Cobb County because that was the only county where there's been any evidence submitted that the signature verification was not properly done."", ""The President. No, but I told you. We're not, we're not saying that."", 'Mitchell. We did say that.', ""The President. Fulton County. Look. Stacey, in my opinion, Stacey is as dishonest as they come. She has outplayed you .\u2009.\u2009. at everything. She got you to sign a totally unconstitutional agreement, which is a disastrous agreement. You can't check signatures. I can't imagine you're allowed to do harvesting, I guess, in that agreement. That agreement is a disaster for this country. But she got you somehow to sign that thing, and she has outsmarted you at every step."", ""And I hate to imagine what's going to happen on Monday or Tuesday, but it's very scary to people. You know, when the ballots flow in out of nowhere. It's very scary to people. That consent decree is a disaster. It's a disaster. A very good lawyer who examined it said they've never seen anything like it."", 'Raffensperger. Harvesting is still illegal in the state of Georgia. And that settlement agreement did not change that one iota.', ""The President. It's not a settlement agreement, it's a consent decree. It even says consent decree on it, doesn't it? It uses the term consent decree. It doesn't say settlement agreement. It's a consent decree. It's a disaster."", ""Raffensperger. It's a settlement agreement."", ""The President. What's written on top of it?"", 'Raffensperger. Ryan?', ""Germany. I don't have it in front of me, but it was not entered by the court, it's not a court order."", ""The President. But Ryan, it's called a consent decree, is that right? On the paper. Is that right?"", ""Germany. I don't. I don't. I don't believe so, but I don't have it in front of me."", ""The President. Okay, whatever, it's a disaster. It's a disaster. Look. Here's the problem. We can go through signature verification, and we'll find hundreds of thousands of signatures, if you let us do it. And the only way you can do it, as you know, is to go to the past. But you didn't do that in Cobb County. You just looked at one page compared to another. The only way you can do a signature verification is go from the one that signed it on November whatever. Recently. And compare it to two years ago, four years ago, six years ago, you know, or even one. And you'll find that you have many different signatures. But in Fulton, where they dumped ballots, you will find that you have many that aren't even signed and you have many that are forgeries."", 'Okay, you know that. You know that. You have no doubt about that. And you will find you will be at 11,779 within minutes because Fulton County is totally corrupt, and so is she totally corrupt.', ""And they're going around playing you and laughing at you behind your back, Brad, whether you know it or not, they're laughing at you. And you've taken a state that's a Republican state, and you've made it almost impossible for a Republican to win because of cheating, because they cheated like nobody's ever cheated before. And I don't care how long it takes me, you know, we're going to have other states coming forward — pretty good."", ""But I won't .\u2009.\u2009. this is never .\u2009.\u2009. this is .\u2009.\u2009. We have some incredible talent said they've never seen anything .\u2009.\u2009. Now the problem is they need more time for the big numbers. But they're very substantial numbers. But I think you're going to fine that they — by the way, a little information — I think you're going to find that they are shredding ballots because they have to get rid of the ballots because the ballots are unsigned. The ballots are corrupt, and they're brand new, and they don't have seals, and there's a whole thing with the ballots. But the ballots are corrupt."", ""And you are going to find that they are — which is totally illegal — it is more illegal for you than it is for them because, you know, what they did and you're not reporting it. That's a criminal, that's a criminal offense. And you can't let that happen. That's a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. And that's a big risk. But they are shredding ballots, in my opinion, based on what I've heard. And they are removing machinery, and they're moving it as fast as they can, both of which are criminal finds. And you can't let it happen, and you are letting it happen. You know, I mean, I'm notifying you that you're letting it happen. So look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state."", ""And flipping the state is a great testament to our country because, you know, this is — it's a testament that they can admit to a mistake or whatever you want to call it. If it was a mistake, I don't know. A lot of people think it wasn't a mistake. It was much more criminal than that. But it's a big problem in Georgia, and it's not a problem that's going away. I mean, you know, it's not a problem that's going away."", ""Germany. This is Ryan. We're looking into every one of those things that you mentioned."", ""The President. Good. But if you find it, you've got to say it, Ryan."", ""Germany. .\u2009.\u2009. Let me tell you what we are seeing. What we're seeing is not at all what you're describing. These are investigators from our office, these are investigators from GBI, and they're looking, and they're good. And that's not what they're seeing. And we'll keep looking, at all these things."", ""The President. Well, you better check on the ballots because they are shredding ballots, Ryan. I'm just telling you, Ryan. They're shredding ballots. And you should look at that very carefully. Because that's so illegal. You know, you may not even believe it because it's so bad. But they're shredding ballots because they think we're going to eventually get there .\u2009.\u2009. because we'll eventually get into Fulton. In my opinion, it's never too late. .\u2009.\u2009. So, that's the story. Look, we need only 11,000 votes. We have are far more than that as it stands now. We'll have more and more. And .\u2009.\u2009. do you have provisional ballots at all, Brad? Provisional ballots?"", 'Raffensperger. Provisional ballots are allowed by state law.', 'The President. Sure, but I mean, are they counted, or did you just hold them back because they, you know, in other words, how many provisional ballots do you have in the state?', ""Raffensperger. We'll get you that number."", 'The President. Because most of them are made out to the name Trump. Because these are people that were scammed when they came in. And we have thousands of people that have testified or that want to testify. When they came in, they were proudly going to vote on November 3. And they were told, ""I\'m sorry, you\'ve already been voted for, you\'ve already voted."" The women, men started screaming, ""No. I proudly voted till November 3."" They said, ""I\'m sorry, but you\'ve already been voted for, and you have a ballot."" And these people are beside themselves. So they went out, and they filled in a provisional ballot, putting the name Trump on it.', 'And what about that batch of military ballots that came in. And even though I won the military by a lot, it was 100 percent Trump. I mean 100 percent Biden. Do you know about that? A large group of ballots came in, I think it was to Fulton County, and they just happened to be 100 percent for Trump — for Biden — even though Trump won the military by a lot, you know, a tremendous amount. But these ballots were 100 percent for Biden. And do you know about that? A very substantial number came in, all for Biden. Does anybody know about it?', 'Mitchell. I know about it, but —', ""The President. Okay, Cleta, I'm not asking you, Cleta, honestly. I'm asking Brad. Do you know about the military ballots that we have confirmed now. Do you know about the military ballots that came in that were 100 percent, I mean 100 percent, for Biden. Do you know about that?"", ""Germany. I don't know about that. I do know that we have, when military ballots come in, it's not just military, it's also military and overseas citizens. The military part of that does generally go Republican. The overseas citizen part of it generally goes very Democrat. This was a mix of 'em."", ""The President. No, but this was. That's okay. But I got like 78 percent of the military. These ballots were all for .\u2009.\u2009. They didn't tell me overseas. Could be overseas, too, but I get votes overseas, too, Ryan, in all fairness. No they came in, a large batch came in, and it was, quote, 100 percent for Biden. And that is criminal. You know, that's criminal. Okay. That's another criminal, that's another of the many criminal events, many criminal events here."", ""I don't know, look, Brad. I got to get .\u2009.\u2009. I have to find 12,000 votes, and I have them times a lot. And therefore, I won the state. That's before we go to the next step, which is in the process of right now. You know, and I watched you this morning, and you said, well, there was no criminality."", ""But I mean all of this stuff is very dangerous stuff. When you talk about no criminality, I think it's very dangerous for you to say that."", ""I just, I just don't know why you don't want to have the votes counted as they are. Like even you when you went and did that check. And I was surprised because, you know .\u2009.\u2009. And we found a few thousand votes that were against me. I was actually surprised because the way that check was done, all you're doing, you know, recertifying existing votes and, you know, and you were given votes and you just counted them up, and you still found 3,000 that were bad. So that was sort of surprising that it came down to three or five, I don't know. Still a lot of votes. But you have to go back to check from past years with respect to signatures. And if you check with Fulton County, you'll have hundreds of thousands because they dumped ballots into Fulton County and the other county next to it."", ""So what are we going to do here, folks? I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break. You know, we have that in spades already. Or we can keep it going, but that's not fair to the voters of Georgia because they're going to see what happened, and they're going to see what happened. I mean, I'll, I'll take on anybody you want with regard to [name] and her lovely daughter, a very lovely young lady, I'm sure. But, but [name] .\u2009.\u2009. I will take on anybody you want. And the minimum, there were 18,000 ballots, but they used them three times. So that's, you know, a lot of votes. And they were all to Biden, by the way, that's the other thing we didn't say. You know, [name] , the one thing I forgot to say, which was the most important. You know that every single ballot she did went to Biden. You know that, right? Do you know that, by the way, Brad?"", 'Every single ballot that she did through the machines at early, early in the morning went to Biden. Did you know that, Ryan?', ""Germany. That's not accurate, Mr. President."", 'The President. Huh. What is accurate?', 'Germany. The numbers that we are showing are accurate.', 'The President. No, about [name] . About early in the morning, Ryan. Where the woman took, you know, when the whole gang took the stuff from under the table, right? Do you know, do you know who those ballots, do you know who they were made out to, do you know who they were voting for?', 'Germany. No, not specifically.', 'The President. Did you ever check?', 'Germany. We did what I described to you earlier —', 'The President. No no no — did you ever check the ballots that were scanned by [name] , a known political operative, balloteer? Did ever check who those votes were for?', 'Germany. We looked into that situation that you described.', ""The President. No, they were 100 percent for Biden. 100 percent. There wasn't a Trump vote in the whole group. Why don't you want to find this, Ryan? What's wrong with you? I heard your lawyer is very difficult, actually, but I'm sure you're a good lawyer. You have a nice last name."", ""But, but I'm just curious, why wouldn't, why do you keep fighting this thing? It just doesn't make sense. We're way over the 17,779, right? We're way over that number, and just if you took just [name] , we're over that number by five, five or six times when you multiply that times three."", ""And every single ballot went to Biden, and you didn't know that, but now you know it. So tell me, Brad, what are we going to do? We won the election, and it's not fair to take it away from us like this. And it's going to be very costly in many ways. And I think you have to say that you're going to reexamine it, and you can reexamine it, but reexamine it with people that want to find answers, not people that don't want to find answers. For instance, I'm hearing Ryan that he's probably, I'm sure a great lawyer and everything, but he's making statements about those ballots that he doesn't know. But he's making them with such — he did make them with surety. But now I think he's less sure because the answer is, they all went to Biden, and that alone wins us the election by a lot. You know, so."", 'Raffensperger. Mr. President, you have people that submit information, and we have our people that submit information. And then it comes before the court, and the court then has to make a determination. We have to stand by our numbers. We believe our numbers are right.', 'The President. Why do you say that, though? I don\'t know. I mean, sure, we can play this game with the courts, but why do you say that? First of all, they don\'t even assign us a judge. They don\'t even assign us a judge. But why wouldn\'t you .\u2009.\u2009. Hey Brad, why wouldn\'t you want to check out [name] ? And why wouldn\'t you want to say, hey, if in fact, President Trump is right about that, then he wins the state of Georgia, just that one incident alone without going through hundreds of thousands of dropped ballots. You just say, you stick by, I mean I\'ve been watching you, you know, you don\'t care about anything. ""Your numbers are right."" But your numbers aren\'t right. They\'re really wrong, and they\'re really wrong, Brad. And I know this phone call is going nowhere other than, other than ultimately, you know — Look, ultimately, I win, okay? Because you guys are so wrong. And you treated this. You treated the population of Georgia so badly. You, between you and your governor, who is down at 21, he was down 21 points. And like a schmuck, I endorsed him, and he got elected, but I will tell you, he is a disaster.', ""The people are so angry in Georgia, I can't imagine he's ever getting elected again, I'll tell you that much right now. But why wouldn't you want to find the right answer, Brad, instead of keep saying that the numbers are right? 'Cause those numbers are so wrong?"", ""Mitchell. Mr. Secretary, Mr. President, one of the things that we have been, Alex can talk about this, we talked about it, and I don't know whether the information has been conveyed to your office, but I think what the president is saying, and what we've been trying to do is to say, look, the court is not acting on our petition. They haven't even assigned a judge. But the people of Georgia and the people of America have a right to know the answers. And you have data and records that we don't have access to."", ""And you can keep telling us and making public statement that you investigated this and nothing to see here. But we don't know about that. All we know is what you tell us. What I don't understand is why wouldn't it be in everyone's best interest to try to get to the bottom, compare the numbers, you know, if you say, because .\u2009.\u2009. to try to be able to get to the truth because we don't have any way of confirming what you're telling us. You tell us that you had an investigation at the State Farm Arena. I don't have any report. I've never seen a report of investigation. I don't know that is. I've been pretty involved in this, and I don't know. And that's just one of 25 categories. And it doesn't even. And as I, as the president said, we haven't even gotten into the Dominion issue. That's not part of our case. It's not part of, we just didn't feel as though we had any to be able to develop —"", ""The President. No, we do have a way, but I don't want to get into it. We found a way .\u2009.\u2009. excuse me, but we don't need it because we're only down 11,000 votes, so we don't even need it. I personally think they're corrupt as hell. But we don't need that. All we have to do, Cleta, is find 11,000-plus votes. So we don't need that. I'm not looking to shake up the whole world. We won Georgia easily. We won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. But if you go by basic, simple numbers, we won it easily, easily. So we're not giving Dominion a pass on the record. We don't need Dominion because we have so many other votes that we don't need to prove it any more than we already have."", ""Attorney Kurt Hilbert. Mr. President and Cleta, this is Kurt Hilbert, if I might interject for a moment. Ryan, I would like to suggest that just four categories that have already been mentioned by the president that have actually hard numbers of 24,149 votes that were counted illegally. That in and of itself is sufficient to change the results or place the outcome in doubt. We would like to sit down with your office, and we can do it through purposes of compromise and just like this phone call, just to deal with that limited category of votes. And if you are able to establish that our numbers are not accurate, then fine. However, we believe that they are accurate. We've had now three to four separate experts looking at these numbers."", 'The President. Certified accountants looked at them.', ""Hilbert. Correct. And this is just based on USPS data and your own secretary of state data. So that's what we would entreat and ask you to do, to sit down with us in a compromise and settlements proceeding and actually go through the registered voter IDs and the registrations. And if you can convince us that 24,149 is inaccurate, then fine. But we tend to believe that is, you know, obviously more than 11,779. That's sufficient to change the results entirely in and of itself. So what would you say to that, Mr. Germany?"", ""Germany. I'm happy to get with our lawyers, and we'll set that up. That number is not accurate. And I think we can show you, for all the ones we've looked at, why it's not. And so if that would be helpful, I'm happy to get with our lawyers and set that up with you guys."", ""The President. Well, let me ask you, Kurt, you think that is an accurate number. That was based on the information given to you by the secretary of state's department, right?"", ""Hilbert. That is correct. That information is the minimum, most conservative data based upon the USPS data and the secretary of state's office data that has been made publicly available. We do not have the internal numbers from the secretary of state. Yet we have asked for it six times. I sent a letter over to .\u2009.\u2009. several times requesting this information, and it's been rebuffed every single time. So it stands to reason that if the information is not forthcoming, there's something to hide. That's the problem that we have."", ""Germany. Well, that's not the case, sir. There are things that you guys are entitled to get. And there's things that under law, we are not allowed to give out."", ""The President. Well, you have to. Well, under law, you're not allowed to give faulty election results, okay? You're not allowed to do that. And that's what you done. This is a faulty election result. And honestly, this should go very fast. You should meet tomorrow because you have a big election coming up, and because of what you've done to the president — you know, the people of Georgia know that this was a scam — and because of what you've done to the president, a lot of people aren't going out to vote. And a lot of Republicans are going to vote negative because they hate what you did to the president. Okay? They hate it. And they're going to vote. And you would be respected. Really respected, if this thing could be straightened out before the election. You have a big election coming up on Tuesday. And I think that it is really is important that you meet tomorrow and work out on these numbers. Because I know, Brad, that if you think we're right, I think you're going to say, and I'm not looking to blame anybody, I'm just saying, you know, and, you know, under new counts, and under new views, of the election results, we won the election. You know? It's very simple. We won the election. As the governors of major states and the surrounding states said, there is no way you lost Georgia. As the Georgia politicians say, there is no way you lost Georgia. Nobody. Everyone knows I won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. But I'll tell you it's going to have a big impact on Tuesday if you guys don't get this thing straightened out fast."", ""Meadows. Mr. President, this is Mark. It sounds like we've got two different sides agreeing that we can look at those areas, and I assume that we can do that within the next 24 to 48 hours, to go ahead and get that reconciled so that we can look at the two claims and making sure that we get the access to the secretary of state's data to either validate or invalidate the claims that have been made. Is that correct?"", ""Germany. No, that's not what I said. I'm happy to have our lawyers sit down with Kurt and the lawyers on that side and explain to him, hey, here's, based on what we've looked at so far, here's how we know this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong."", ""Meadows. So what you're saying, Ryan, let me let me make sure .\u2009.\u2009. so what you're saying is you really don't want to give access to the data. You just want to make another case on why the lawsuit is wrong?"", ""Germany. I don't think we can give access to data that's protected by law. But we can sit down with them and say —"", ""The President. But you're allowed to have a phony election? You're allowed to have a phony election, right?"", 'Germany. No, sir.', ""The President. When are you going to do signature counts, when are you going to do signature verification on Fulton County, which you said you were going to do, and now all of a sudden, you're not doing it. When are you doing that?"", ""Germany. We are going to do that. We've announced —"", 'Hilbert. To get to this issue of the personal information and privacy issue, is it possible that the secretary of state could deputize the lawyers for the president so that we could access that information and private information without you having any kind of violation?', ""The President. Well, I don't want to know who it is. You guys can do it very confidentially. You can sign a confidentiality agreement. That's okay. I don't need to know names. But on this stuff that we're talking about, we got all that information from the secretary of state."", ""Meadows. Yeah. So let me let me recommend, Ryan, if you and Kurt will get together, you know, when we get off of this phone call, if you could get together and work out a plan to address some of what we've got with your attorneys where we can we can actually look at the data. For example, Mr. Secretary, I can you say they were only two dead people who would vote. I can promise you there are more than that. And that may be what your investigation shows, but I can promise you there are more than that. But at the same time, I think it's important that we go ahead and move expeditiously to try to do this and resolve it as quickly as we possibly can. And if that's the good next step. Hopefully we can, we can finish this phone call and go ahead and agree that the two of you will get together immediately."", ""The President. Well, why don't my lawyers show you where you got the information. It will show the secretary of state, and you don't even have to look at any names. We don't want names. We don't care. But we got that information from you. And Stacey Abrams is laughing about you. She's going around saying these guys are dumber than a rock. What she's done to this party is unbelievable, I tell you. And I only ran against her once. And that was with a guy named Brian Kemp, and I beat her. And if I didn't run, Brian wouldn't have had even a shot, either in the general or in the primary. He was dead, dead as a doornail. He never thought he had a shot at either one of them. What a schmuck I was. But that's the way it is. That's the way it is. I would like you .\u2009.\u2009. for the attorneys .\u2009.\u2009. I'd like you to perhaps meet with Ryan, ideally tomorrow, because I think we should come to a resolution of this before the election. Otherwise you're going to have people just not voting. They don't want to vote. They hate the state, they hate the governor, and they hate the secretary of state. I will tell you that right now. The only people that like you are people that will never vote for you. You know that, Brad, right? They like you, you know, they like you. They can't believe what they found. They want more people like you. So, look, can you get together tomorrow? And, Brad, we just want the truth. It's simple."", ""And everyone's going to look very good if the truth comes out. It's okay. It takes a little while, but let the truth come out. And the real truth is, I won by 400,000 votes. At least. That's the real truth. But we don't need 400,000 votes. We need less than 2,000 votes. And are you guys able to meet tomorrow, Ryan?"", ""Germany. I'll get with Chris, the lawyer who's representing us in the case, and see when he can get together with Kurt."", 'Raffensperger. Ryan will be in touch with the other attorney on this call, Mr. Meadows. Thank you, President Trump, for your time.', 'The President. Okay, thank you, Brad. Thank you, Ryan. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. Bye.']"

This is some crowd. You know, Biden was here today, also. [booing] They had 14 people in three cars. No, there was no way. And I just wanna thank you. You know, I\'ve had two elections. I won both of them. It\'s amazing. [cheers and applause] And I actually did much better on the second one. It\'s great to be back in this incredible state, the home of hardworking patriots who believe in God, family and country. [cheers and applause] Tomorrow, each of you is gonna vote in one of the most important runoff elections of the history of our country. We\'re—frankly, forget about runoff. One of the most important elections, really. It\'s really not runoff. It\'s elections because it\'s a biggie. Our country\'s depending on you. The whole world is watching the people of Georgia tomorrow. And you\'ve gotta swamp them because everything\'s so crooked around. I mean not, and not here. They were saying, ""Oh, he\'s complaining about Georgia."" No, no. I\'m complaining about eight different states, uh, and I think we\'re gonna win them all. You\'re gonna get everyone you know. You\'re gonna show up at the polls in record numbers. You gotta swamp \'em and together we\'re gonna defeat the Democrat extremists and deliver a thundering victory to David Perdue.

One thing I've learned about Republicans, they have some difficulties, but you know a difficulty that they don't have? They never forget. They never forget. And people are gonna find that out because, uh, we have to go and we have to go all the way and that's what's happening. You watch what happens over the next couple of weeks.

One of the largest–actually–the single largest increase in the history of our country. No person that won, went to a second term, or went through an election where he got nearly 12 million votes. Nope. It never happened before. Never happened before. We made historic gains among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and we won the largest share of non-white vote of any Republican president in 60 years. We also won 18 out of 19 bellwether counties. Now, when you win just a few bellwether counties, you always win the election. We won 18 out of 19. That\'s a record, and they said we didn\'t win. We won 25 of 26 toss-up House races. And I think we have one that we\'re waiting for, right? Did you see the one in–hello, Mike. How are you, Mike? Did you see the one in New York where Claudia, good woman–they keep finding votes. They keep finding votes. ""She\'s up by 18. Oh, we just found 19 votes."" That\'s ahhh— same kind of stuff. Democrats were projected to gain 15 House seats and instead–and Kevin McCarthy gives us the credit. Good man. Very good man.

You must deliver a Republican victory so big that the Democrats can't steal it or cheat it away. We have all [laughs; points to individual on his left]– he goes—they'll be trying though, I'll tell you that. We have all seen what our opponents are capable of doing. I ran two elections. I won both of them. [cheers] Second one, much more successful than the first. But we can't let this happen any longer. On election night, we were leading by so much. We're not gonna have that tomorrow. We're not gonna have that tomorrow night, where you're leading and then all of a sudden, boom, it's gone like magic. We won Florida and Ohio in record numbers. We won Iowa by 8.2%. Nobody's ever won those three States and lost. Never happened before. It's almost impossible unless people do a lot of–either get very lucky or they cheat. We're up 293,000 votes in Michigan, 112,000 votes in Washington. In Wisconsin we were way up, 356,000 votes, in Georgia, 356,000. And 700,000 votes in Pennsylvania. It was over. I should have run up to the podium and said, thank you very much for this wonderful victory. Then maybe they wouldn't have had time to close those booths, right, the counting rooms, and do what they did. But then it all started to disappear. And I tell this story because we can't let this happen tomorrow, Kelly. So, keep your eyes open. Since the election, we have put forth indisputable evidence documenting the rampant fraud, which will be announced on Wednesday as you know. [cheers and applause]"", 'And I wanna thank Senator Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz and all of the incredible senators that have stepped up to fight, because they\'ve seen what happens.

And they said, ""Why is he fighting for Georgia? It\'s not enough."" No, I need three. I\'m fighting in eight, actually, but six, and we\'re gonna win \'em all. [cheering] But they said, ""Why?"" So, one of the people, a very fine woman actually, but she said, ""Why is he fighting Georgia? It doesn\'t get him there."" I said, ""No, but Georgia and Pennsylvania and one other get me there. And we have six and maybe eight, if you look at \'em and we were leading all of them by a lot, until, like a miracle, it started to quickly disappear."" Right here in Georgia there were tens of thousands of illegal votes cast and counted. You know that. And here are just a few examples. Watch this for tomorrow. We were up 10,315 ballots were cast by individuals whose name and date of birth matches a Georgia resident who died in 2020 prior to the election. Then your wacky Secretary of State said two people, two people. Now, I don\'t know how many people are on that list, but it\'s a lot of people. Two thousand, five hundred and six ballots were cast by individuals whose name and date of birth matches an incarcerated felon in a Georgia prison. Maybe they aren\'t all there, but they did a lot of work. I paid a lot of money to a lot of people. I can tell you that. Four thousand five hundred and two illegal ballots were cast by individuals who do not appear on the state\'s voter rolls. Well, that\'s sort of strange. Eighteen thousand three hundred and twenty-five illegal ballots were cast by individuals who registered to vote using an address listed as vacant according to the postal service. At least 86,880 ballots were cast by people whose registrations were illegally backdated. Oh, I can\'t believe that happened. Sixty-six thousand votes—you have to understand, we\'re down by a little more than 11,000. So, every one of these is determinative. Sixty-six thousand votes in Georgia were cast by people under the legal voting age. At least 15,000 ballots were cast by individuals who moved out of the state prior to the November 3rd election, or maybe they moved back in. I don\'t know. I mean, I can\'t tell. They moved out, ah, let\'s go back. Usually takes a little time, right? You know. We moved out. Let\'s go back, darling.', ""Georgia's absentee ballot rejection rate went from an average of 3% in 2016, and then went down very low to almost zero now. Think of it, almost zero. If you multiply that out. And this is with many, many more ballots pouring in. Went to almost zero. Forty-eight out of 159 counties in Georgia rejected no ballots at all. These absentee ballot rejection rates prove that the tens of thousands of illegitimate ballots were counted. There were more absentee ballots in 2020 than ever before by for [sic]. But magically far fewer ballots were rejected. This alone is more than enough to swing the election to us. This one thing. I'm going over individual. In all of the swing states. Now they'll check this out and that's fine, but you take a look at it. Officials, egregiously violated state laws in order to solicit, facilitate and promote cheating and theft on a scale never seen before. These crooked and incompetent officials suspended signature verification. I said, I want you to go to Fulton County to check the signatures, because hundreds of thousands of ballots came in. I want you to check the signature to see if it compares to somebody that lived there two years, four years or six years ago. They don't wanna do it. The Secretary of State and your incompetent Governor. Although he thinks I've been a great President.

They put these drop boxes there. And in a number of cases, they'd be gone for three days. They'd take them up, and where are they? Where are they? They were gone. Georgia Secretary of State agreed to a litigation settlement, which is something that nobody's ever seen one like this. I want, I wanna just tell you that Stacey Abrams took him to the cleaners. [booing] That drastically and illegally changed the states election procedures. They never got the mandated approval from your state legislature, who by the way, you have some great people in your legislature. Some great, great people who agree with what we're saying and even more so."", ""But think of it. They never got the approval. You have to by law, under the Constitution, you can't just do these deals and not get the approval. And your Secretary of State or whoever it was, made this horrible consent decree, horrible, which got rid of so much safety. It's a disgraceful thing. And it was only approved by your local politicians, him, and local judges. You can't do that. You have to have your state legislatures do it. That's true with all States. Tens of thousands of votes are missing. We go all over the world telling people how to run their elections, and we don't even know how to run ours. The most unhappy person right now, anywhere in the United States is Hillary Clinton. Because she's asking the Democrat party, why the hell didn't you do this for me? [laughter] True. Why didn't you do it for me"", 'Crowd. [chanting] Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!', 'The President. Why the hell didn\'t you? You notice how quiet she\'s been? I shouldn\'t have said that, now tonight she\'ll–but you notice how quiet–she\'s furious, because she said, ""Don\'t forget, I won Michigan by 10,000 votes."" We did much better. As I said, this time. Much, much better, but I won Michigan from her by 10,000 votes. I won Wisconsin by a small, you know—I mean, they couldda done that one and not get caught. We caught \'em, we caught \'em. And I say to people like Mike Lee, that are here and Lindsey, I say, if they got approved and verified, they use the word verified, votes that are fraudulent. And then we find out after, \'cause you can\'t do it that quickly. It doesn\'t go that quickly. It\'s a lot of work and a lot of votes and a lot of people. And then we find out that they were frauds like in one state where you had, let\'s say you lost by 25,000 votes. They verify it. And that\'s supposed to be the end. But shortly thereafter, we find out that we actually won the state by 250,000 votes. Does that mean that that state plus others adds up to being your President? I don\'t think it should. I don\'t think it should. I don\'t think that Kelly feels it should. I don\'t think that Marjorie feels it should. In Wisconsin over 90,000 ballots were illegally harvested. Can\'t do that. Not allowed to.', ""Through so-called human drop boxes and over 500 illegal unmanned drop boxes were put out statewide. In addition, over 170,000 absentee votes were counted that are blatantly illegal under Wisconsin law and should never have been included in the tally. By the way, I lost the–it was razor thin. There's 170,000 votes. The margin in Wisconsin is only 20,000 votes. So, this issue alone would have won that state for us many times over, we were leading at 10 o'clock in the evening by a lot."", ""In Pennsylvania, there were 205,000 more ballots cast than there were voters. How do you get around that one? Which remains completely unexplained. You have great senators and representatives there and nobody can explain it but think of that. And in other places too, you had more ballots than you had voters. You had more votes, think of it, then you had voters by a lot. In addition, Democrat state Supreme Court judges and Democrat Secretary of State effectively abolished the signature verification process right here. They counted ballots cast after deadlines, and they allowed ballots to be illegally fixed in Democrat-controlled areas. And I say this because you can't let this happen tomorrow. And I hope all the politicians are listening. There's an unexplained 400,000 vote discrepancy between the number of mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania sent out reported on November 2nd, 2020. And the number reported on November 4th. They can't explain it. Four hundred thousand previously unreported mail-in ballots magically appeared. They couldn't explain it. And all of a sudden, they just happened to find 400,000. That's a lot of people. Amazing. [booing]"", ""And the Pennsylvania legislature is not happy. Pennsylvania also had an estimated 8,000 dead voters, 55,000 ballots received back before they were even sent. How about that? The ballots were received, but they weren't sent yet. Oh, get them out fast please. Many more with no mail date and 14,000 ballots illegally cast by out-of-state voters. Those are numbers, and those are numbers we got from them. So, they can't say, oh, the numbers aren't so good. In Clark County, Nevada, over 130,000 ballots, this is far, just so you know, all these numbers, these are far more than we need, were processed on machines where the signature matching threshold was intentionally lowered to a level that you could sign your name, Santa Clause, and it wouldn't pick it up. Didn't pick up anything. More than 42,000 people in Nevada double voted. That's more than we needed, by far."", ""In Arizona more than 36,000 votes were cast by non-citizens. And there were 11,000 more ballots than there were voters. It seems to be a trait, doesn't it? This was like at the Super Bowl, where you have 15 cameras and they'd say camera number four, you're on. Camera number three, you're on."", ""In Michigan, according to one analyst, over 35,000 ballots listed no address, over 13 ballots were cast by non-residents and an estimated 17,000 ballots were cast by dead people.

In addition, there is the highly troubling matter of Dominion voting machines. [booing]"", 'And I want you to watch this very carefully tomorrow everybody, you have to watch it carefully. I wanna read you from a letter from Georgia state Senator William Ligon. You know who he is, right? Highly respected guy. ""Dear Mr. President, as chairman of the Georgia Senate Judiciary Committee on elections. I request that you immediately send an outside team of cyber experts to investigate potential hacking and other irregularities associated with Dominion voting systems, scanners, ballot marking devices, ballots, polling pads used in the 2020 general election in Georgia.""', ""You don't hear this from your Secretary of State, and you don't hear this from your Governor, and you do have a great legislature. I have to tell you. But the Governor won't let 'em hold the session to decertify. On December 30th, 2020, the committee held a hearing investigating potential fraud and other irregularities during Georgia's 2020 general election. The Committee first unanimously approved a report dated December 17th, 2020, discussing a myriad of voting irregularities and potential fraud in Georgia 2020 general election, discussed in an earlier hearing held on December 3rd. Notably the Committee stated in the executive summary that the November 3rd, 2020, general election was chaotic and reported results must be viewed as untrustworthy. They are untrustworthy, despite the line of crap that you hear from these people that represent you. I don't know where they come from."", ""The Committee then heard—and this is from one of your most highly respected political representatives—the Committee then heard additional testimony concerning voting irregularities during the 2020 general election, including testimony and a real time test demonstrating serious irregularities with Dominion's voting machines. Three events discussed at this hearing stand out and require a forensic audor [sic] of the Dominion voting machines in Georgia to be immediately conducted. The Governor will not let us do it. We've been asking them now since November 4th, the day after the election. He won't let us do it. Why won't he let us do it? There's only one reason I can think of. First, the Dominion voting machines employed in Fulton County. That's the home of Stacey. Had an astounding 93.67 error rate. 93.67 error rate in the scanning of ballots requiring a review panel to adjudicate or determine the voter's intent. So, they're going to a voter intent. What did the voter mean by this vote? Somebody votes for Trump. I, you know, I think that voter meant something other. He doesn't want Trump. Let's just switch it around. Think of that. They're trying to determine the voter's intent in over 106,000 ballots out of a total of 113,000 ballots. This is from your representative, highly respected. The national average for such an error rate is far less than 1.2%. So, that was 93%. The source of this astronomical error rate must be identified to determine if these machines were set up or designated to allow for a third party to disregard the actual ballot cast by the registered voter. This is what I have. There was no way. Look at this crowd we have here. Biden came here. He had nobody. [cheers and applause]"", ""Gallup, Gallup. You know, the Gallup poll. They did a–I don't say this braggingly, the most admired man in the world or the country. [cheers and applause] I don't say it. I say it for a different reason. So, I came in first. Obama came in second, and Biden came in waaaay low. Then I say, and they say, and people have said, how is it possible that a guy who got 80 million votes can't get any votes for the most admired man. You know why? Because he didn't come in first. That's why."", 'Second, again from this very respected political leader, ""Second, there is clear evidence that tens of thousands of votes were switched from President Trump to former Vice President Biden in several counties throughout Georgia. For example, in Bibb County,"" anybody live in Bibb County? Bibb, Bibb, B-I-B-B. ""President Trump was reported to have 29,391 votes at 9:11 PM, while simultaneously former Vice President Joe Biden was reported to have 17,218. Minutes later at the next update these vote numbers switched with President Trump now having 17,000. And Biden now having 29,391."" [booing] That was a switch of over 12,000 votes. It was like a miracle. Third, ""During this hearing, a presenter demonstrated that a Dominion Poll could be hacked into in real time because it was connected to the internet."" Now, anything connected to the internet, that\'s not good. But this demonstration proved that these machines could allow votes to be siphoned off or added during the voting process because they\'re connected to the internet. Cybersecurity experts agree that voting machines should not be connected to the internet at any time, in any way, shape or form. Did you see that during the hearing? This guy sitting there. Well, can you connect into the machines? Yes. How do you do that? Within about 25 seconds, he controlled the internet. Former Vice President Biden led Georgia by only 11,779 votes. Every one of the things I told you about almost is more votes than what we\'re talking about. The crime that was committed in this state is immeasurable. An immediate forensic audit of an appropriate sampling of Dominion\'s voting machines and related equipment is critical to determine the level of illegal fraudulent ballots, improperly counted in Georgia during the 2020 general election and during tomorrow\'s race. You\'ve gotta be very careful. [cheers and applause]', 'And, let me also quickly read a letter from Mark Finchem, Chairman of the Arizona House, a very respected man, Federal Relations Committee. ""Dear Mr. President, subsequent to the election, members of the legislature were inundated with complaints from constituents relating to the intensity of the general election, and the integrity, more important than anything else, and the accuracy of canvassed results. In many instances, constituents reported that their earlier in-person ballots may not have been correctly processed or tabulated in Maricopa County officials. Members of the legislature have conducted two public hearings in recent weeks during which significant evidence of fraudulent and illegal voting in Arizona has been demonstrated through expert and eyewitness testimony. For example, in Pima County and Maricopa County, it appears that 143,000 illegal votes were actually injected into the ballot system."" Think of that. No, but think of this.', ""Also, and you know, the press won't report this, they probably turn it off, oh, we don't like this. They don't like this. They don't wanna talk about numbers. They talked about my phone call. They don't like my phone call; everyone loved my phone call. They don't like talking about numbers, because nobody knew the numbers were so egregious. Also, an expert mathematician concluded that the only explanation for the actual voting results in Arizona is that 100%–think of this, 130% of Democrats voted for candidate Biden, and a negative 30% voted for President Trump. Now, think of that. In order to get to the numbers 130% of the voters, that's a little tough to get, okay, had to vote for him, and minus 30 had to vote for me, and that gets you to a 100%. And nobody has a 100% voting."", ""For all of these people who think it's too late, does that mean that we're forced to approve a fraudulent election or an election with massive irregularities?"", 'Crowd. No!!!!!', ""The President. I don't think so. I don't think so. I wanna thank those two great political leaders. And, but we have many other letters just like that. Same thing. Hundreds of thousands of votes are missing. The only way to combat the Democrat fraud is to flood your polling places with a historic tidal wave of Republican voters tomorrow. [cheers and applause] Because at a certain point, the machines are gonna explode. They almost did with me, unfortunately they didn't quite get there, but we'll figure that out. And I just want Mike Lee to listen to this when I'm talking, because you know what? We need his vote.

But then somebody ran up to the stage all dressed up nicely--when it was at seven, but now I just walked up and it\'s at 14--but she ran up when it was seven and, you know, we have to do what\'s good for our party. And she was up and I said, ""Wow, she\'s doing, uh, like a speech like she won."" She didn\'t win, she lost.', 'And, you know, last week we had a little bit of a problem. And if you remember, Ron was very upset because she ran up and she pretended she won Iowa. And I looked around, I said, ""Didn\'t she come in third?"" Yeah, she came in third. And then I looked at the polls. She was talking about most winnability, who\'s gonna win? And I had one put up, I don\'t know if you see it, but I have one put up. We\'ve won almost every single poll in the last three months against Crooked Joe Biden, almost every poll. And she doesn\'t win those polls. [cheering] And she doesn\'t win those. This is not your typical victory speech, but let\'s not have somebody take a victory when she had a very bad night, she had a very bad night.', 'And you, uh, you have the now very unpopular governor of this state-- this guy he\'s got to be on something. [booing] I\'ve never seen anybody with energy. He\'s like, uh, hopscotch. And, uh, you know, I\'m watching this guy and two weeks ago he said, ""We\'re gonna win. We\'re gonna win in a landslide. We\'re gonna win."" About three days ago he started saying, ""Well, we wanna do well."" That\'s a big difference.', ""But I walked out just now, we're 14 points up and I don't know what it's gonna be, but when she was up here, it was like six or seven and you know with like 7% of the vote counted. Now, uh, let me just tell you, we, uh, had an unbelievable week last week. And Iowa, we set a record. [cheering]"", 'It was the best in the history of the caucus, in the history! And, uh, I remember I sorta had the same feeling. I\'m up and I\'m watching and I said, ""She\'s taking a victory lap."" And we ki—we beat her so badly, she was-- But Ron beat her also. You know, Ron came in second and he left. She came in third and she\'s still hanging around. The other thing, she only got 25% of the Republican votes. I don\'t know if you saw that. Tremendous numbers of Independents came out, because in this state--because you have a Governor that doesn\'t frankly know what the hell he\'s doing--in this state, in the Republican primary, they accept Democrats to vote. In fact, I think they had 4,000 Democrots—Democrats--before October 6th. They already voted. Now, they\'re only voting because they want to make me look as bad as possible because if you remember, we won in 2016, and if you really remember it, if you want to play it straight, we also won in two thousand twenty. [cheering] By more! And we did much better in two thousand twenty than we did in two thousand sixteen.', 'But as they said, we lost by a whisker, just by a whisker. No, no, no. But we can\'t let that happen. You know, you have to have people that speak up. I said, I can go up and I can say to everybody, ""Oh, thank you for the victory, it\'s wonderful, it\'s what--"" Or I can go up and say, ""Who the hell was the imposter that went up on the stage before and, like, claimed a victory?"" She did very poorly actually. She had to win. The governor said, ""She\'s gonna to win, she\'s gonna to win, she\'s gonna to win."" Then she, she failed badly. Now, I have here, if he promises to do it in a minute or less, but the only person more angry than let\'s say me, but I don\'t get too angry. I get even. [laughter, cheering] The only person, because he was there and he did fantastically well by the way, then he endorsed me.', 'And we don\'t have to talk about Tim Scott, who by the way just got engaged. We have to tell you. [Turns to Scott standing behind him, cheering] And that\'s more important than all of this stuff. But a man that got to know her very well is Vivek [Ramaswamy]. I said, Vivek. I said, ""Vivek, go up and say a few words about it."" He has to do it in one minute or less, and then we\'re gonna just say, ""We had one hell of a night tonight."" And one other thing before Vivek comes. Do you see that poll? [points to his left.] We\'re gonna put it up. We have beaten Biden. You could almost say, ""Who can\'t? Who da hell can\'t?"" The man can\'t put two sentences together. He can\'t find the stairs off a stage. Who can\'t? But Vivek, one minute or less, go do it, Vivek. [cheering]', ""VIVEK RAMASWAMY: What we saw tonight is America first defeating America last. That's what we saw tonight. If you want America Last, you can go to Joe Biden. You've got another candidate still apparently in the Republican primary, cut your social security to fork over more money to Ukraine so some kleptocrat can buy a bigger house. Go to Nikki Haley. But you know who delivered a double-digit victory tonight?--it is a double-digit victory as of right now--is this man Donald J. Trump the leader of America First. And that means something. [cheering] Now, USA and Donald Trump, America First. Now, I've got 30 seconds left. I want to make this point, here, OK? We gotta to say this, we gotta say this right. What we see right now with her continuing in this race is the ugly underbelly of American politics where the megadonors are trying to do one thing when we the people say another."", 'And it\'s up to us, to we the people, to at long last say, ""Hell, no. We the people create a government that is accountable to us."" And we, the people have said tonight, ""We want again, as we did in Iowa, Donald J. Trump."" And so you want to actually speak truth, that\'s the truth tonight. And the only thing they\'re rooting for is an ugly thing that we don\'t wanna see happen. That\'s what these people are rooting for, is playin\' to say long enough so the Reid Hoffmans and the ugly Democratic George Soros Juniors, who are funding the lawsuits against Trump, can prop up their puppet. We say no to that vision. I say the general election begins tonight, and this man will win it in a landslide. God bless you, Donald J. Trump. Vote Trump USA. [cheering, embraces Trump]', ""TRUMP: Very nice. Wasn't that nice? So this was a great evening and I wanna thank everybody in the audience, and I wanna thank the people that are standing behind me. You know, uh, I--I think we called it right, immigration's a big deal, a big deal, a very big deal. We have millions and millions of people flowing into our country illegally. We have no idea who the hell they are. They come from prisons and they come from mental institutions, and it's gonna—it's just killing our country. And I'm talking about millions and millions and millions. They are drug dealers, they're everybody. And they come in just like, walking right through. There's nobody to check, and there's nobody to vet, and we have a man with us tonight, Tom Homan, who is—[cheering] central casting, he's central casting. And I'd like you to say a few words about the border, and who's gonna solve that problem, and how quick are we gonna do it, Tom. Go ahead, please. [applause]"", ""TOM HOMAN: Look, I worked for six presidents starting with Ronald Reagan, and every president I ever worked for did something to secure the border, but no one did more than President Trump. The most secure border in my lifetime. [applause] The most secure border we've ever seen. And Donald Trump's goin' a do it again. We're gonna lock the border down, and we're gonna protect Americans. Because what's happening at the border right now, a record number Americans have died from fentanyl poisoning, a record number migrants have died. A record number of women and children to sex traffic, a record number known suspected terrorists across the border. There's one man who's proven he can secure the border and he's standing to my left, Donald J. Trump. He's gonna do it again. [cheering]"", 'TRUMP: Thank you very much, Tom. So, this is an evening, uh, that I will not forget because it\'s the third time, but more importantly, uh, I think it\'s gonna be—it\'s gonna be the most important time. We won, uh, both—it was I think they said--somebody said, ""you rarely--if you win both--"" they\'ve never had a loser, let me put it that way. When you win Iowa and you win New Hampshire, they\'ve never had a loss. There\'s never been. So we\'re not gonna be the first, I can tell you. And I just, I just do wanna reiterate the polls--we\'re way up on everybody. We\'re way up on Biden. And over the last couple of months, if you check--and you have to remember in 2016, they were saying, ""Oh, what does he know about elections? He\'s not gonna win. He can\'t win. He can\'t w--"" We won, and we got millions, and you can check this, and I hope the cameras don\'t turn off \'cause they hate this, but we got millions and millions of more votes the second time, right, Mr. Congressman?', ""Millions and millions of more votes, and, ah, but we had COVID, and they use COVID to cheat, and they did a lot of other things, too. We're not gonna let that happen, and that's still—and that's still goin' along. You can't forget--you can never forget history because if you forget, you never, you never recover from it and you repeat, you repeat. And we're not gonna repeat. We're gonna have the greatest election success. We're gonna turn our country around."", 'And if you take a look throughout the history of our country, if you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of this not great country right now, it\'s a country in decline, it\'s a troubled country, it\'s a failing country frankly. But if you took the 10 worst presidents and put \'em together--the 10 worst, absolutely 10 worst. I used to say five. Remember I started, I\'d say five. Then I said, ""Wait a minute, we can add another five."" They would not have done the damage that crooked Joe Biden has done to our wonderful country. They would not have done the damage. There\'s never been anything like it. And you say, ""Are they stupid people?"" I don\'t think so, because nobody can cheat that well if they\'re stupid. Do they hate our country? They must hate our country because there\'s no other reason that they can be doing the things they do. Take a look, the taxes, they want to raise your taxes times four. They want to let the Trump Tax cuts-- the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country--they want them to expire. Your taxes are gonna go through the roof.', 'You take a look at regulations, they\'re throwing regulations. You can\'t breathe. You can\'t even breathe with what they\'re doing. You take a look at our border, so bad, there\'s never been a border like this in the world. Four years ago we had the safest, best border in the United States. I built hundreds of miles of border wall. And they always say, ""Oh, he didn\'t build hundreds of miles,"" because if there\'s a board laying on the ground, they say ""That\'s a renovation."" They call it a renovation. If there\'s two nails laying from 50 years ago, they say, ""Oh, that was a renovation."" These are very dishonest people and you\'re always fighting them.', ""And just a little note to Nikki: She's not gonna win. [laughter] She's not gonna win. But if she did, she would be under investigation by those people in 15 minutes, and I could tell you five reasons why already. Not big reasons. A little stuff that she doesn't want to talk about. But she will be under investigation within minutes and so would Ron have been, but he decided to get out. He decided to get out. Now, Vivek, I don't think would be at all because he's perfect, right? [cheers] And Tim Scott, I know would never--that's no chance. Hey, Tim. Do you wanna say something? Come on, come on. I want him to say something. [applause]"", ""TIM SCOTT: Le--New Hampshire, the President said a double-digit win in New Hampshire and you delivered a double-digit win for President Trump. [cheering] But I'm gonna invite you to my home state startin' tomorrow. [cheering] Where this election--is over! It is time for the Republican Party to coalesce around our nominee and the next President of the United States, Donald Trump. Let's get that party started tonight. [cheering]"", 'TRUMP: What a good guy. What a good man he is. But just remember, I did hear Nikki say, ""And now it\'s off to South Carolina."" Well, I love South Carolina.', 'Audience: We love you.', ""TRUMP: I love it. But she forgot one thing. She forgot one thing. Next week it's Nevada. Next week it's Nevada, it's not South Carolina. We love South Carolina, but next week it's Nevada. And I'm pleased to announce we just won Nevada. [cheering] We just won, 100%. Because all of 'em, they looked at it, and they took polls, and I was polling at 95% to 4 or 5%, and they decided not to play in Nevada. So we just won Nevada. We have a man from Nevada here, Steve Wynn, wherever he may be. And John Paulson, the great John Paulson made plenty of money in Nevada. Doesn't live there, but he makes a hell of a lot of money. He makes money everywhere he goes, actually. So, money machine."", ""Maybe we'll put you--you know what? Put him at Treasury. You want to make a little money? Let's put-- Anyways, good to have you guys. Uh, but we go to Nevada and that's been won, so we pick up all of those delegates. And then we do go to South Carolina where we've done really well, where I've done well. We have a great governor and lieutenant governor and great everything, because almost every one of them have endorsed me--two great Senators--which is hard. I mean, did you ever think that--she actually appointed you, Tim? And [laughs] think of it, appointed and you're the senator of the state and she endorsed me. You must really hate her. Naw, it's a shame. It's a shame—[Tim Scott steps forward to Trump's left shoulder] Uh-oh. [laughter]"", 'SCOTT: I just love you. [applause]', ""TRUMP: No, that's-- That's why he's a great politician. [applause] That's why he's a great politician."", ""So this is a great evening and it is-- We are going to Nevada for a little while. We're not gonna have to do too much. We have a great team there. But it's a team that uh we can now send someplace else. They did a fantastic job but, uh, we--and it's a fantastic place, really a fantastic place. But we'll be leaving there very quickly. We'll head out to South Carolina where I think we're gonna win easily. I think we're 50 points up, five-oh, five-oh. Fifty points up on a person that was governor, that tells you something. But I felt I should do this because I find in life you can't let people get away with bullshit, OK, you can't. [shouts and cheering] You just can't do that."", 'And when I watched her in the fancy dress that probably wasn\'t so fancy-- come up-- I said, ""What\'s she doing, we won?"" And she did the same thing last week, but he was much more angry about it than I was. I said, ""Get up there and you let them know."" We are going to win this, we have no choice. If we don\'t win, I think our country is finished, I do. I believe our country is finished. We have an opportunity to do something so amazing. And the good news, and the reason we have such support--the best numbers I\'ve ever had--the reason we have support is because they are so bad at what they\'re doing and so evil. And they\'re destroying our country.', ""So I wanna thank everybody for being here. I wanna thank this group of people [gestures at crowd in front of him]. We will never forget you. We will never forget. [cheering] And I made a pledge—I made a pledge to your state that you have the highest energy costs in the country. In the first year, they're gonna be reduced by 50% because we are gonna drill, baby drill. Drill, baby drill. Inflation is going to come way down. But in the first year, your energy costs are going down by 50%."", ""Thank you very much. We love you. Thank you very much. We'll see you soon. We'll see you on the trail. And thank you everybody, thank you very much. We will see you on the trail. Thanks."", ""[Music: Sam and Dave: Hold on I'm Coming]""]"
