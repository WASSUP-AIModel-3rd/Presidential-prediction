0,Joseph R. Biden ,"July 23, 2021","[""The President. Hello, Virginia! It's so great to be back. First off, it goes without saying how much I appreciate your current Governor, Ralph Northam, by the way. Because of the hard work of the American people, we've put ourselves in a position for us to control the virus instead of it controlling us."", 'Here in Virginia, COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations are down 90 percent since January; 54 percent of your population has been fully vaccinated, 82 percent of your seniors, both of which are above the national average.', ""But this didn't happen by itself. It's due to the heroic vaccination program, one of the greatest and most complex operational challenges in American history. It happens when we all work together: the Federal Government, States, cities, the private sector, and all of Americans."", ""Look, it happens when you have Governors like Ralph who've been a key partner, coordinating FEMA and the National Guard to move personnel and resources around the State to get shots in arms. It happens when you're honest with people."", ""You know, I know folks are watching the number of cases rising again and are wondering what it means for them. Well, here's the truth: If you're fully vaccinated, you're safer with a higher degree of protection. But if you're not vaccinated, you are not protected."", 'And now—what we have now is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. And by the way—you know the old expression—you notice a lot of our very conservative friends have finally had an ""altar call."" [Laughter] They\'ve seen the Lord—[laughter]—whether it\'s on Fox News or whether it\'s the most conservative commentators or Governors.', ""Thank God the Governor of Arkansas—excuse me, of Alabama—had one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country—is now—and I give—I'm genuinely complimenting her——"", 'Audience members. Stop Line 3! Stop Line 3! Stop Line 3!', 'Audience member. We love you, Joe!', ""The President. That's okay. That's all right. That's all right. No, no, no. Let them talk. No, let——"", 'Audience members. [Inaudible]', ""Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe!"", 'Audience members. [Inaudible]', ""The President. That's okay. Look, look, this is not a Trump rally. Let them holler. No one is paying attention to them."", 'Audience members. Stop Line 3! Stop Line 3! Stop Line 3! ', ""The President. Look, here's the point: Virtually all the COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations are today among the unvaccinated people. And I know this has gotten a bit politicized, but I hope it's starting to change. It's not about red States or blue States or guys like that hollering; it's about life, and it's about death. And I know Governor Northam is going to work like the devil to finish the job. Thank you, Gov."", ""Look—and, of course, it's great to be with another great friend that's been around—I've been around a long time, and I've—seldom do I get to campaign for someone who I've agreed with more on basically everything. We go back all the way to roots in Syracuse, New York."", ""I'm talking about—and before that, I'm actually talking about Dorothy. [Laughter] Her roots don't go there, but it—look, she's always been there for me and Jill when we've needed her most. She was an incredible First Lady of Virginia, and she will be again. She is the very best."", ""And, Dorothy, speaking of First Ladies, I'm Jill's husband. Jill wanted to be here tonight. But if you turn on your—turn on the Olympics and watch Team U.S.A., you'll see Jill Biden standing there, cheering with them."", ""The Japanese Prime Minister, who was—I invited him to be the first person to come to the White House—head of state—he made it real clear: He didn't want me, he wanted her to go. [Laughter] He is a man of incredible judgment. [Laughter]"", ""Look, folks, now, of course, it's great to be with my friend and your once and future Governor, Terry McAuliffe."", 'I mean this—think about this——', 'Audience members. Terry! Terry! Terry!', ""The President. You've got it. You're not going to find anyone—I mean anyone—who knows how to get more done for Virginia than Terry. That's a fact. You don't have to wonder what kind of Governor Terry will be; you know what kind of Governor he was and what kind of Governor he'll be again."", ""He was a great Governor of Virginia, and he'll be even greater this time because he even has more going for him. And, Virginia, you've got to elect him again. You've got to elect him again. And I mean this: not just for Virginia, but for the country. The country is looking. These off-year elections, the country is looking. This is a big deal."", ""Terry and I share a lot in common. I ran against Donald Trump, and so is Terry. [Laughter] And I whipped Donald Trump in Virginia, and so will Terry. I tell you what, the guy Terry is running against is an acolyte of Donald Trump, for real. I mean, it's just like—I don't know where these guys come from. [Laughter] I really mean it."", ""But above all, Terry and I—Terry, we share the same vision about delivering results and, maybe most importantly, why we got involved in politics in the first place. The very wealthy—and I respect anybody who makes a lot of money; you should be able to be a millionaire or billionaire, whatever you want, as long as you pay your fair share. But here's the deal: They don't need me to protect them."", 'I got involved in politics because the neighborhood I came from, the towns I came from—Scranton and Claymont, Delaware, a little steel town—delivering results for hard-working people, who, if you just give them a chance—just a chance, they never, never let the country down.', ""You know—I really mean that. That's not hyperbole. I really mean it. Just, look—I've been in office now for 6 months, as of a couple days ago."", 'Audience members. Yeah!', ""The President. And I think the administration has a lot to be proud of. We've vaccinated over 160 million Americans. We've created over 3 million new jobs, more than any administration has in the first 6 months in entire Presidential history. Never has it happened before."", ""We eliminated—what we're on—we're now estimated to be on track—the economy, not growing before the recession, before COVID, said the economy would grow—it would be 3 and 3½ percent. Now everything from the OECD to all Wall Street suggests that we're going to grow this economy 7 percent just this year. That is the highest growth in more than four decades in America. In fact, it's the best job growth in the world right now."", 'And in just the past few weeks, one of the biggest tax cuts in the history for families in American with kids went into effect this last week.', ""I've been saying—I really mean this—it's about time ordinary, hard-working people get a tax break. Because that's what it is. Parents should see that money going into their bank accounts right now. And let me tell you what it's going to mean for Americans: We're going to cut child poverty in half this year because of that."", ""Look, Terry and I share the same basic truth: Trickle-down economies never work. It's time to build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. That's where we are. And by the way, the wealthy have never done poorly when the middle class and the working class people do well—they do well."", ""Look, Terry understands that it started with the American Rescue Plan that's delivering immediate relief to the folks who needed it most, folks who were on the back of their—on heels, a lot of them knocked down. Those rescue checks that went out to more than 80 percent of the adults and children in Virginia that provide a little extra breathing room for people."", 'My dad used to say—I really mean this—my dad used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck; it\'s about your dignity. It\'s about respect. It\'s about your place in the community. It\'s about just having, Joey""—and I mean this sincerely. When he left—lost everything in Scranton, and we moved to Delaware, he said: ""Joey, it\'s about a little breathing room. That\'s all people are asking for, is just a little bit of breathing room, a little extra room.""', ""Look, aid for small businesses, that helps them hire, reopen their doors. I'm looking—here it is. Excuse me."", '[At this point, the President paused to take a drink of water.]', 'Aid to cities and counties to keep their police officers and firefighters and first responders on the job, educators on the job. The American Rescue Plan lowered health insurance premiums for those buying into the Affordable Care Act by 40 percent on average, saving people $600 a year. And Terry knows the work continues: that health care should be right, just not a privilege, folks.', ""And as I said when I was running, with Terry and Dorothy's help, it's not enough to build back. I mean this sincerely. America is the only nation in the world, when it's faced a crisis, has come back stronger than before the crisis—the only one. I'm not joking. We have to build back and build back better. It's amazing how that phrase has caught on around the world, isn't it?"", 'But Terry and I know, along with Mark Warner and Tim Kaine and Don Beyer and Abby Spanberger, who are working on this in Congress. It means modernizing our physical infrastructure. Folks, we used to invest more than any country in the world in research and development. And we had the number-one infrastructure in the world: the best roads, highways, airports, ports.', 'Infrastructure is about rebuilding roads and bridges, replacing lead pipes that are poisoning our kids and the water system; delivering high-speed internet to every single Virginian, rural and urban; making sure ""Buy American""—so when we invest in the jobs, when we purchase all this, that American workers are doing the work.', ""It's not that complicated. It really isn't if you fight for it."", ""Terry and I share the belief that building back better means investing also in our human infrastructure. You know, that's my plan. It includes all the things Terry is fighting for. Terry and I believe that when we educate our children earlier, they do better. They do better. No, by the way—no matter what background they come from, all the studies at the great universities in this State and others have—in the last 8 years—have pointed out that if a kid goes to—not daycare, but preschool, beginning at age 3, they increase, by 58 percent, the possibility of going all the way through school and on to community college."", ""That's why we support universal pre-K for 3- and 4-years-old. And, Terry, if I get it done, you all aren't going to have to pay for it here in Virginia."", ""And look, we believe 12 years of education is not enough to compete in the 21st-century economy. That's why I want to make 2-year community college available to every single American. We can afford to do this."", 'I do have one concern. My wife Jill is teaching full time still as a community college professor and First Lady. But Terry is going to be her boss again. [Laughter] Because she teaches at—anyway—Northern Virginia Community College. [Laughter]', ""And by the way, Terry, since the time she started working there, she's never stopped teaching. When we got elected, she thought that she was going to continue to teach. She thought I might object. I strongly supported it. Teaching is not what my wife does, it's who she is."", 'And, folks, look—look—the fact is that the idea that we are able to bring together people to give them great opportunities is totally within—you know, look—and we can afford to do this. We can afford to do this. If the very wealthy just start paying their fair share just a little bit.', 'Terry and I know how hard the pandemic has been on working families, especially women. About 2 million women are still unable to go back into the workforce during this pandemic due to things like not being able to afford childcare.', 'Look, when I got elected to the United States Senate, I was 29 years old. Between the time I got elected and before I was sworn in, there was an automobile accident. My wife and daughter were killed, and my two boys almost died. And by the way, I thank all firefighters. It took the ""Jaws of Life"" 3 hours to get them out on top of their dead mom and dead sister. You saved their lives.', 'And I needed help. I was a Senator making $42,000 a year. I could no longer afford daycare and someone to take care of my kids, then fly. And thank God I had a sister who is my friend, who—she and her husband, without my asking, moved in and helped me raise my kids. My mom and my brother as well. I got lucky.', ""But look, the idea, as a single mom or a single dad, working and having young children, it's awful hard. That's why Terry and I want to expand paid leave and childcare in this country."", ""And by the way, Terry, you and I have been talking about this for a long time. We've been talking about high drug prices, how incredibly high they are and how they—we keep getting ripped off. You know, we pay more for our drugs than any major country in the world."", ""But here's the deal. There's a way to do it: Let Medicare negotiate drug prices. And guess what? All of the prices are going to come down. And it will pay for itself. I promise you, I'm going to get that done."", 'Look—and here\'s the deal, Terry and I know this can be paid for. Look, we support asking the wealthiest 1 percent who got that $2 trillion tax cut that, in fact, not a single penny was paid for, the so-called ""Trump tax cut.""', 'And guess what? Just pay. Begin to pay their fair share. Corporate America—I come from the corporate capital of the world. More corporations are, in fact, registered in Delaware than every other State in the Union combined. I got elected 36 years there, because I was honest with them.', ""Look, right today, 50 of the biggest corporations in America of the Fortune 500—50 of them don't pay—and this is not an exaggeration; check it out—not a single solitary penny in Federal taxes. Not one. And they made over 40——"", 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. No, but—no, but I'm not doing this to get—I just want to make it clear to you. [Laughter] Here's the deal: They made over $40 billion. If they just paid a minimum tax of 15 percent, they'd raise the dollars—all we need to do all this education we're talking about here."", 'Look, you know—when I was Vice President, the President asked me to check out what the major corporations needed the most. Along with the Secretary of Commerce, we interviewed three hundred and, I think it was, fifty-six—it could have been forty-six—but over three hundred and fifty CEOs and major corporations.', 'You know what they all said? ""I need a better educated workforce."" Well, guess what? They\'re not spending any money to educate the workforce.', 'But if we want to make sure America succeeds and runs the world again—economically runs and—be the most powerful economy in the world, we should make sure that they have a chance.', ""These millionaires and billionaires—I'm not one of these guys that say you shouldn't be able to be a millionaire or billionaire. But just pay your fair share."", ""Look, all told, experts in the World Bank and outfits like Wall Street—on Wall Street, like Moody's, estimate that my plan will grow the economy and create $2 million more jobs over the $16 million they said in 10 years we'd create—good-paying jobs. Good-paying jobs."", ""A significant amount of these jobs will pay the prevailing wage of 30, 40, 50 bucks an hour. Ninety percent of the jobs in our infrastructure plan go to people without a college degree. Folks, we're proposing a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America, a once-in-a-generation investment in American jobs and families that's going to position us to win the competition for the 21st century."", ""But we've got to get it done. And I need a partner like Terry who not only is respected in this State, but is respected by Governors all across America, who knows how to get it done in the States. Folks, on his watch as Governor the last time, the Virginia economy boomed. Two hundred million—200,000 jobs created. Unemployment went down in every single county, including rural Virginia, by nearly 50 percent."", 'He attracted major companies to this State. Look how your State grew. And by the way, any of you who are in the business know the first thing you try to attract a company to come to your city, your State, your town—the first thing they ask is: ""What\'s the highway system? Will I have access to interstate? Is the port available? Tell me whether or not I have broadband. Tell me whether or not""—all the things. All the things we\'re going to build.', ""You know, look, Terry worked with Republicans to invest in education, transportation, and workforce development. And by the way, Virginia has a whole bunch of veterans and Active Duty military members, more than almost any State. And guess what? The American Rescue Plan marked one of the biggest investments in veterans' health in a long, long time. It will upgrade VA hospitals that are 50 years old, reduce the shortages of doctors and nurses."", 'No veteran—from my son who passed away on—should pick up a phone and say, or have a wife or husband call and say, ""I need help,"" and say, ""We can\'t see you for a while."" We owe them immediate action. Immediate. It\'s a sacred obligation.', 'And I know no Governor who stood up for our veterans and military families more than this guy, helping them apply their skills to good-paying civilian jobs, fields like cybersecurity and health care. He also worked with the General Assembly to fund two new veteran care centers, including the first one in Hampton Roads region, which is hard to believe.', 'Terry understands. He knows—he knows—also about crime prevention as a top priority. He understands how important it is to have funding—to find funding—from the American Rescue Plan to provide law enforcement personnel with more resources, not fewer resources.', 'Look, we need to help them in a lot of ways. We need to do away with chokeholds and all those things. I agree, but the other side of this is we need them to have more social workers, more veterans, more psychological help, more psychologists. And where it happens, it works. Personnel and resources, they keep communities safe.', ""And he has taken on the gun lobby to enact sensible gun safety measures without infringing on anybody's Second Amendment right, including keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers."", ""Here's what else: Terry is going to guarantee he's going to move to get a $15 minimum wage. Think about it, folks. Just think about it. And you—maybe some of you, maybe you know people."", 'Anybody working 40 hours a week making less than $15 an hour is, in fact, living in poverty as defined by poverty in America. It should not happen, period. Period.', ""An amazing number of American people who are struggling have rental costs and housing costs that are at least 30 to 35 percent of their total income. How do you do that? How do you make it, especially if you have a child? Look, folks, housing that's affordable—everybody is going to be in the plan."", ""And, like me, when Terry thinks about the climate crisis, he thinks three things: jobs, jobs, jobs. It is the reason why we're going to lead the world."", ""Let me close with this—and I'm sorry, I'm getting kind of wrapped up in this. [Laughter] I need him. I need him. Look, in this election and in 2022, the question the American people are going to be asking is whether or not we're helping them and their families. Not giving them anything—are we giving them a shot, just giving them an even shot? Do we understand what they're going through? Can we deliver for them?"", ""As Democrats, we have to show we do understand, and we're delivering for them, and we're keeping our promises. We just have to keep making the case, just as the Republican Party today offers nothing but fear, lies, and broken promises."", 'No, listen—I mean, think about it—turning on the television every day and seeing a replay of what happened on January 6 and saying, ""I was told there were a lot of peaceful, wonderful people.""', 'Audience members. Boo!', 'The President. God—no, I really mean it. Think about it. It is bizarre.', 'We have to keep cutting through the Republican fog that government is the problem and show that ""We the People"" are the solution. We\'re the most unique country—think about this—we\'re the most unique country in the history of the world. Not a joke. Every other country is put together based on race, religion, ethnicity, background, except the United States.', ""The United States is based on—the only country in the world based on the proposition that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all women and men are created equal, endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. We've never met the test, but we've never walked away from it like the Republicans have."", ""We have never walked away. And we keep—every administration, we keep moving that needle further and further. Look, folks, we're going to have to go out and win: win this thing, win races up and down the ticket. We've got to protect your majority in the House of Delegates. We've got to reelect—we've got to reelect Mark as attorney general. We've got to reelect Hala as your Lieutenant Governor."", ""We've got to elect Terry back as Governor. He's been here before. He knows what to do to. He knows how to get things done."", ""Virginia, we did it in 2020. In the battle for the soul of America, the people voted. Democracy prevailed. The Constitution held. We have to do this again. I've said, time and again, no matter what, you can never stop the American people from voting. And they're trying like hell. We have to decide. The power must always be with the people."", 'Fifty—I promise you this—fifty years from now—fifty years from now, our children, our grandchildren will look back and know that it was at this moment America won the 21st century again. And it starts now. Virginia, it starts with Terry. It starts with you.', 'God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you.']",0
1,Joseph R. Biden ,"September 13, 2021","[""The President. Hello, Long Beach. It's good to be back."", 'Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe!', ""The President. Thank you. Well, I'll tell you what——"", 'Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe!', 'The President. Thank you. Thank you. You all have been standing a long time.', ""And I tell you what, you know, the Governor and I have a lot in common: We both married way up. [Laughter] Jennifer, thank you for the welcome. Thank you for what you do. And thank you for becoming friends with Jill. I'm Jill's husband, Joe Biden."", 'The President. And, folks——', ""Audience member. That's my President! I love you, Joe!"", ""The President. Mayor—[laughter]—Mayor Garcia, it's good to be back in your town. Last time out here, we were talking about infrastructure. Now we've got a lot of money coming this way."", 'Audience members. Yeah!', ""The President. We've got a lot working. We've got an infrastructure bill that we passed. And we're going to do an awful lot more to build this incredible, incredible economy."", ""You know, someone was saying to me earlier today: the most diverse State in the Nation. Matter of fact, I think it was your Senator. The most diverse State in the Nation. The most different State in the Nation. The biggest State in the Nation. And has the—one of the largest economies in the world. And no one sees any inconsistency there. It's because we're diverse you have the largest economy in the world."", ""Senator Padilla, thank you for your leadership in the United States Senate. You're doing an incredible job."", ""And I know she was here last week, but I've got to give a shout-out to my favorite daughter of California who's always taking—talking about you all—talks about you all the time, like I talk about Delaware. She loves you. Matter of fact, she thinks you're the only State in the Nation. [Laughter] Vice President Kamala Harris."", ""And of course, the reason I'm here and you all are here is to thank and support our friend, Governor Gavin Newsom, one of the best Governors in the country."", ""California, I'm not sure you know it, but if you didn't know it, you should: The eyes of the Nation—this is not hyperbole—the eyes of the Nation are on California. Because the decision you're about to make isn't just going to have a—isn't just going to have a huge impact on California. It's going to reverberate around the Nation and, quite frankly—not a joke—around the world."", ""And here's why: All of you know that last year I got to run against the real Donald Trump."", 'Audience members. Boo! [Laughter]', '[At this point, the President made the sign of the cross.]', ""The President. Well, this year—this year, the leading Republican running for Governor is a—the closest thing to a Trump clone that I've ever seen in your State. [Laughter] No, I really mean it. And he's leading the other team. He's the clone of Donald Trump. Can you imagine him being Governor of this State?"", 'Audience members. No!', ""The President. You can't let that happen. There's too much at stake."", 'And here is why it\'s so important for you all to vote ""no"" on a recall: First, voting no will be protecting California from Trump Republicans trying to block us from beating this pandemic. COVID-19: Gavin Newsom has had the courage to lead, stand up for science. For the very thing he\'s been one of the leading Governors in the Nation, protecting his people and vaccinating his State.', 'Meanwhile—meanwhile, we see something else in parts of America. Right now there are certain Republican Governors, like the Governor of Mississippi, who are talking to me about being dictatorial about demanding that people get vaccinated or tested. People are doing everything they can to block or undermine the lifesaving mandates we proposed: putting their people at risk, putting their children at risk, putting their States at risk.', ""And here's the worst thing: For these Republican Governors, it isn't about public health, about the health of the people; it's about politics. Look, folks, just look at the hypocrisy: The same Governors who are attacking me and your Governor for COVID-19 mandates are in a—States with some of the strictest vaccine mandates for children attending school in the whole country."", 'Talk about inconsistency: In Mississippi, children are required to be vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, hepatitis B, polio, tetanus, and more. It\'s a State requirement. But now, in the midst of this pandemic that has taken over 650,000 lives, I propose a mandate for COVID-19 vaccines, and it\'s an ""outrage""; it\'s an ""infringement on freedom.""', ""Look, folks, we don't need politics in this battle against COVID. We need science. We need courage. We need leadership. We need Gavin Newsom, a Governor who follows science, who's got the courage to do what's right and who'll lead."", '[The President coughed.]', 'And I apologize for coughing.', 'Audience member. Five more years, Gavin!', ""The President. Last week, I laid out a six-part plan for the fall to beat this pandemic. First, vaccinate the unvaccinated with new vaccine requirements. Two, protect the vaccinated. Three, keep children safe in school. And four, increase testing and masking. And keep our economy going strong. And take care of people with COVID-19. That's what the science tells us. We have to beat the Delta variant of COVID-19."", 'Gavin will be a Governor who will help us finish the job. Folks, send a message to the Nation: Courage matters. Leadership matters. Science matters. Vote to keep Gavin. Get vaccinated to save lives.', ""Second, by voting no, you'll be keeping a Governor who respects women instead of someone who wrote that women know less about politics and economics than men."", 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. He hasn't met my wife. [Laughter] Look, if you have any doubt about how important it is to have Gavin, who respects women's right to—just take a look at what's happening in States like Texas. They just passed a law empowering complete strangers to become bounty hunters, going after women who exercise their right to choose."", 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. A law the United States Supreme Court refused to stop. Now other States say they're looking to replicate the Texas law. If you don't think women's rights are under assault, you're not looking. California, keep Gavin Newsom and send a message to the Nation. Women are to be respected and their rights protected."", 'Third, by voting no, you\'ll be protecting California from another Trump climate denier who said global warming is, quote, a ""crock"" and depicts it as a myth. Look, it\'s hard to believe there\'s any climate deniers left in America. Let me tell you something: There are. The last place you want someone like that is in the Governor\'s office in California.', ""Audience member. That's right!"", ""The President. You all see what's happening: wildfires burning 2 million acres of California this year alone; 5 million acres have burned—5.9 [million]* in the region. That's bigger than the State—entire State of New Jersey, and it's a big State."", ""The Governor and I were just in Sacramento for a briefing on the Caldor Fire—the Caldor Fire. Last week, I saw the destruction and the death caused by Hurricane Ida in New York, New Jersey, and Louisiana. Folks, extreme weather is here. The climate crisis isn't going away; it's getting worse. We have to deal with it, not deny it."", ""So, California, you've got to keep Gavin Newsom as Governor and send a message to the Nation that we have to deal with the climate crisis now. We can't wait any longer."", ""When I got elected President, I immediately rejoined the climate Paris—the Paris climate accord. Just since we put that together in our administration—in Barack's administration—just since then, everything has collapsed even further. We don't have much time. Not a joke. We're talking about 9 to 10 years before we pass the point of no return. And——"", 'Audience member. [Inaudible]', 'The President. You—our children need it. The planet needs it.', ""Look, fourth, by voting no, you'll be standing up for a Governor who protects workers rather than one who believes there shouldn't be—I can't believe this guy—[laughter]—there shouldn't be a minimum wage?"", 'Audience members. Boo!', 'The President. The leading Republican candidate thinks the minimum wage should be zero.', 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. Look, working people have taken it on the chin too long. We need leaders like Gavin who will respect them, hear them, fight for them. To me, it's pretty basic: If you're working a 40-hour week, you shouldn't be living in poverty. That's why I support a $15 minimum wage. Gavin is leading the way in California."", ""I'm so tired of trickle-down economics. It's about time we build from the bottom up and the middle out. So, California, keep Gavin and send a message: It's time to give working people just a fighting chance. They have never, ever, ever, ever, ever let the country down. All they want is just an even shot. They have never let the country down."", ""Folks, I can go on, but here's the deal. I'm going to make this a simple as I can: You either keep Gavin Newsom as your Governor, or you'll get Donald Trump."", 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. It's not a joke. A Republican Governor blocking progress on COVID-19, who is also anti-woman, anti-worker, a climate denier, who doesn't believe in choice."", 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President.

First, you don't have to wonder what kind of Governor Terry will be because you know what a great Governor he was. It wasn't just because of what he'd promised, it's what he delivered. On his watch, Virginia's economy boomed. Two hundred thousand jobs created. He made a record addition of $1 billion investment in education expanding preschool and resources for public schools in lower income communities and gave teachers a raise. Okay?"", ""Now, I must say, parenthetically, the real reason I'm here tonight is, my wife Jill teaches full time at Northern Virginia Community College. And Terry's going to be her boss. [Laughter]"", 'Look, Terry stood by our veterans, helping them apply their skills in good-paying civilian jobs in fields like cybersecurity and health care; funding for new veteran care centers, including the first one in the Hampton Roads region.', 'Look, he took on the gun lobby and enacted sensible gun safety measures without infringing on the Second Amendment, including helping keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers.', ""Virginia, you know Terry. You know his record. He was a great Governor. If you reelect him again, he'll be another 4 years as a great Governor."", ""But look, how well do you know Terry's opponent?"", 'Audience members. No!', 'The President. Well, just remember this: I ran against Donald Trump, and Terry is running against an acolyte of Donald Trump.', ""Terry's opponent doesn't like to talk about how—very much now—but to win the Republican nomination, he embraced Donald Trump.

But now he doesn't want to talk about Trump anymore."", 'Well, I do. Talk about an oxymoron: Donald Trump and election integrity?

Trump did the same thing about John McCain. That\'s who Donald Trump is. All coming from a guy who invented the ""big lie,"" drove a mob of insurrectionists to breach the Capitol on the 6th of January. And to this day, he incites people all around the country.

To Donald Trump, the insurrection isn\'t a violent assault that took place on January 6 at the Capitol. No. To Trump, the insurrection was the November 3 election when more Americans voted than had ever voted in all of our history. That\'s the ""big lie"" that Terry\'s opponent embraced.', 'And it prompted the Washington Post to write something about Terry\'s opponent that every Virginian should read before they vote, and I quote: ""Glenn Youngkin has failed [the] character test. . . . He . . . has indulged and encouraged Republicans who have swallowed former President Trump\'s lie that last year\'s Presidential election was stolen. . . . Mr. Youngkin chose to dignify a fundamental fiction that is subverting our system, rather than stand[ing] . . . squarely for the truth. In doing so, he proved himself unfit for office.""

Higher than it's ever been."", ""Not only that, more people are working today than just before the pandemic started. Household wealth is up. People are buying more things. Manufacturing is up.

We've got more to do."", ""So, if you're looking for someone who is going to keep your economy going and growing, the man behind me is the guy to get it done. He'll do it again."", ""In fact, we're taking a page from Terry's book when he was Governor and when he'd be Governor next time. We're emerging from this pandemic, and we want to expand pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds, millions of pre-K students. That's what's in my Build Back Better initiative.

As we said during this pandemic, no parent should have to park in a McDonald's parking lot to have access to their internet for remote learning. Think about that.

No one—no one—working full-time should live below the poverty line."", ""And here's what else you ought to think about. Terry's opponent has made all of his private pledges of loyalty to Donald Trump. But what's really interesting to me: He won't stand next to Donald Trump now that the campaign's on. [Laughter]"", ""Think about it. He won't allow Donald Trump to campaign for him in this State. And he's willing to pledge his loyalty to Trump in private. Why not in public? What's he trying to hide? Is there a problem with Trump being here? Is he embarrassed? Look at who has been here for Terry: my wife Jill, Barack Obama, Kamala Harris, Stacey Abrams, and so many more."", ""Look, let me close with this. There is a fundamental difference between Democrats and Terry McAuliffe and what's going on in today's Republican Party and Terry's opponent."", ""Number one, we stand for working people and the middle class. Trickle-down economics has never worked. We're both building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.

We didn't hear him mention the right to choose. We didn't hear him mention Medicare. We didn't hear him mention Social Security."", 'So let\'s take a look at what Kevin said today. He said Republicans want to, quote, ""preserve our constitutional freedom."" That sounds great. I\'m for doing that as well; we all are. But look at what they\'ve actually done.', ""The MAGA Republicans just cheered and embraced the first Supreme Court decision in our entire history—the first one in our entire history—that just didn't fail to preserve a constitutional freedom, it actually took away a fundamental right that had been granted by the same Court to so many Americans: the constitutional right to choose. And now nearly half the States in the United States of America have either passed a ban on abortion or will shortly. And in many States, abortion is already banned even in cases of rape and incest, a fundamental change."", 'Already, 166 House Republicans have signed on to a bill that would ban abortion nationwide. And the senior Senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, has proposed a national ban on abortion with criminal penalties put on doctors and put them in jail if they, in fact, violate the ban.', 'So, in 46 days, America is going to choose: If Republicans win control of the Congress, abortion will be banned.

Let me tell you something: They're about to find out."", 'And, folks, Kevin McCarthy also talked about, quote, ""longer, healthier lives for Americans."" Again, it sounds great. Who\'s not for that? Well, just look at what the Republicans are doing. Already, 158 House Republicans have signed on to a Republican budget that will cut Medicare and Social Security—already.', 'Audience members.

What do you think the prospects of it coming back exactly as it is?"", ""You've been paying into Social Security ever since you got your first paycheck. Well, then there's Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin."", 'Audience members. Boo!', 'The President. As my mother would say, ""God bless his soul.""

But I sure in hell don't think we should be defunding the FBI either."", ""And then there's the—then there's the day we'll never forget, on January 6. What happened on the 6th? Law enforcement was attacked, assaulted, brutalized, and stomped on, and later, several died. Some lost their lives because of that day. The MAGA Republicans didn't side with law enforcement; they sided with the insurrectionists. And they still do. Don't tell me you support law enforcement if you can't condemn what happened on January the 6th. Don't tell me that."", 'You can\'t—you can\'t be pro-law enforcement and pro-insurrection. You can\'t claim to be a party of law and order and call the people who attacked the police on January 6 ""patriots."" That\'s what they\'re called.', ""And you can't claim to be for a safe America if you take orders from the NRA.

But lose children like they lost their children? Enough. We've had enough. It's time to pass the assault weapons ban."", ""Look, I support the Second Amendment. I have two shotguns, and I'm not—I—the only thing I really do is really target practice. I haven't done that in a long time.

It can penetrate your vests."", 'And by the way, as I pointed out when I was—got a pass the first time as a Senator—in Delaware, we\'re a big gun-owning State. A lot of duck hunters, a lot of hunters. And I\'d be going—and I literally went up and down the streams campaigning and going to the people who were part—who belonged to the NRA and others. And I\'d say, ""How many deer out here are wearing Kevlar vests?"" [Laughter] You know?', ""No, but I'm—seriously, think about it. What in God's name do you need an assault weapon for? It's an assault weapon designed to kill people, to defend America, to defend people. But, folks, look, it's just—we're just—it's way out of hand. I've taken on the RNA [NRA]* and I beat them before, and I plan on doing it again."", ""And, folks, we can do it again. Our children—our children—should be in a situation of learning how, as I said, to read and write, not duck and cover. So, in 46 days, if you want a safer America, America faces a choice. Republicans will once again side with the NRA and put American families and children at risk. And, I mean, some Democrats as well, and there are some Republicans who support us. It's not down the line, but it's the—part of their platform. Democrats will ban assault weapons once and for all, God willing."", 'Kevin McCarthy also talks about their being for a strong economy.

In the United States of America—in the United States of America—that was happening—all across America.', ""The most anemic job performance since Herbert Hoover was in place.

And every single Republican voted for it."", ""Nearly 10 million more jobs have been created since I've been President, the highest number of jobs in that period of time of any President of the United States of America. We have a 3.7-percent unemployment rate, the lowest in 50—more than 50 years; a record number of new—record number of new small businesses created; and over 668,000 new manufacturing jobs in America."", ""The American Rescue Plan helped keep teachers, police officers, firefighters, first responders on the job. It provided the money needed to get schools open. And it was a big reason we've been able to vaccinate over 220 million Americans."", 'More to do.', ""With the infrastructure law we passed, we did get some Republican help for that. Well, that infrastructure law is the most significant investment in America since President Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System."", 'Now—some Republicans voted for it, and some were critical. But the truth is, there\'s a lot more Republicans out there taking credit for the new bridges and those—[inaudible]—that are collapsing than actually voted for it. I love going by, and they\'re, you know—""And this is great thing. I voted against it, but this is a great thing."" [Laughter]', ""But, folks, in addition to inheriting a failed MAGA Republican economy, we also confronted a global pandemic and Putin's war in Ukraine, and that's driven the global inflation we see today. That's why it's so important that we pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which I proposed from the beginning, but didn't get passed until this summer."", 'This law will cut costs for families, help reduce inflation at the kitchen table.

And my dad used to say—he used to talk about whether inflation or—the situation of a family to have breathing room is: At the end of the month, when you paid all your bills, did you have a little bit left—just a little bit left?', ""So there's more than one way—more than one way—to deal with the inflation to a family: to lower the price of the things they have to deal with, because that's what folks at home think about. How much of their monthly bills—how much do they have to pay for the necessities?"", 'This law is going to give them just a little more breathing room, as my dad would say. We pay more for our prescription drugs than any nation in the world. Well, for years, so many of us for a long time, and many of the unions in here—every one of the unions here—have been trying to fix this problem.', 'For years, Big Pharma has blocked us in Medicare from negotiating drug prices. But not this year. We beat Big Pharma. We finally beat them, first time. Big Pharma lost. And, folks, now Medicare will have the power to do what so many Democrats and many Republicans in the past talked about doing: lowering prescription drug prices. They pay billions of dollars. They can negotiate lower prices like other countries do.', 'And the seniors—we passed a law saying: Beginning in January, no senior, no matter what the cost of prescription drugs—cancer drugs, whatever drugs they have; and some of them can be $60-, $70-, $80,000 a year—no senior will have to pay, no matter what the cost of their drugs, more than $2,000 a year beginning in January.', ""And if you're a—if you're on Medicare and you have diabetes, the cost of your insulin—instead of being 30 to 40 to 50 times more than the cost to make the insulin, it costs 10 bucks to make that insulin—10—and package it. But now you cannot charge any senior—and we should make it for everybody. They voted down the other piece. But every senior will not have to pay more than $35 a month for the cost of their insulin."", 'We wanted to cut the cost of insulin for everyone—for everyone, including the hundreds of thousands of children who have type 1 diabetes.', 'But look, folks, imagine being the parent of a child who had type 1 diabetes; you had no insurance, and you had no coverage. You have to look at that child and know—and know—that if he or she does not have access to that insulin, it will fundamentally affect their lives in ways that are going to be damaging for the rest of their lives. Imagine the feeling.', 'My dad used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It\'s about your dignity. It\'s about respect."" And he\'d always end by saying, ""It\'s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, \'Honey, it\'s going to be okay.\'""', ""Well, guess what? The Republicans blocked limiting that cost to 35 bucks for kids. As I said, it only costs 10 bucks for that prescription that he made and packaged. Drug companies are charging families more than 30 times as much for that drug on a monthly basis. And a lot of people just can't do it."", ""Imagine, as I said, being that mom and dad needing that insulin. It has to be—I was down in Virginia at a function. I met a mom who said they have to ration the insulin, be able—I mean, it's wrong. It's not who we are. We're going to fix that as well, I promise you."", 'Folks, the bottom line: This law is going to lower energy costs as well. Gas prices—I know I got criticized for going into the stockpile.

We invest in climate crisis, $369 billion to deal with the climate crisis.', 'And it makes the Tax Code fairer. In 2020, 55 of the biggest corporations in the country paid zero dollars in Federal income taxes.', 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. And they made $40 billion. It's not right. So we put a stop to it by enacting a corporate minimum tax of only—but only 15 percent. Today, the days of big, profitable corporations paying nothing in Federal income tax is over."", ""And guess what? Every single Republican voted against the Inflation Reduction Act. When it actually comes to actually doing something about inflation, Republicans said no. And they said, time and again, that the first chance they get, they're going to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act."", ""And here's what else Republicans are, in terms of their fiscal recklessness. Donald Trump and the Republicans had no problem——"", 'Audience member. Boo!', ""——had no problem enacting, in his 4 years, a $2 trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly benefitted the top 1 percent. And they didn't pay for a penny of it. And it massively increased the Federal deficit."", 'Meanwhile—you know, we always say the Democrats are the big spenders? We brought down the deficit—$350 billion the first year and nearly $1.5 trillion this year. And the Inflation Reduction Act is going to reduce it another $300 billion because—over the next 10 years, because Medicare can reduce—can pay less for the drugs they have to buy for the seniors.', ""So I don't want to hear it from Republicans. They're the ones who blew up the deficit. They're the ones—and we're the ones bringing it down."", ""And now, thanks to the historic deficit reduction, we can afford to cancel $10,000 in student debt and $20,000 if you have a Pell grant for tens of millions of Americans making under $125,000. It's a gamechanger."", ""And Republicans are already looking for their hand-picked judges to deny relief to those hard-working Americans. They will not succeed, in my view, but that's who they're looking for."", 'And finally, with a straight face, Kevin McCarthy says that MAGA Republicans will restore faith in our elections. [Laughter] As we say in my faith, ""Bless me, Father, for I have sinned."" [Laughter] Restore—restore—faith in our elections? MAGA Republicans refuse to accept the results of the 2020 election and the will of the people.', 'Eighty-one million people voted Democrat for President last time. Even though they lost court case after court case after court case after court case after court case, even in front of Trump-appointed judges. And recount after recount proved the results were accurate. It\'s become a litmus test in their party to pledge loyalty to Donald Trump by buying into the ""big lie."" Now, I\'m serious. You all see it on—all on television.', ""Look, the fact is that a lot of them—I've had six Republican Senators who I've known for some time come to me—and I gave them my word I'd never mention names, and I never will—separately, telling me that they agree with this, that, or the other thing that I was proposing, but if I voted for it, it would cost them their election because they'd lose a primary."", ""Well, you see what's happening. You see the MAGA Republican program being adapted by all these folks in the primary. And then once they get out of the primary, they're trying like hell to figure out how to get out from under that.

It can't survive when one side believes there's only two outcomes to an election: Either they win, or they were cheated. [Laughter]"", ""That's not democracy.

Only when you win."", 'So, folks, in just 46 days, democracy will be on the ballot.

The average profits they're making—if they did the average profits they've made for the last 20 years, guess what? Your gasoline prices would be down 50 cents a gallon. No, I'm serious. If we're investing in profits that are at a historic rate, prices would come down even further.

Not a joke.', ""So much is changing, from technology to politics—across the board—the environment, everything. It's all at stake.

A choice between two fundamentally different versions of America."", ""I said from the beginning of my campaign, my objective when I ran was to build—build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.

No, I—no, I really mean it. It's important to remind ourselves of the detail. The fact of the matter is, we were at 6.4-percent unemployment when I came to office.

We got over 655 million of those shots so far."", 'And, folks—and you know, one of the reasons why the Governor here—and the Governor of all the States—was able to havekeep police on the force, keep firefighters on the force, keep teachers in the classroom is because of the legislation we passed without one single Republican vote. It was all Federal money that came to the States to allow that to happen. And Mike helped make that happen.', ""He also helped—he also helped—when I signed the bipartisan infrastructure law, the most significant investment in our Nation's infrastructure. The most significant since the Interstate Highway System that Eisenhower came up with."", ""And I'll caution you for just a minute. Look, folks, we used to have—we used to be number one in the world in infrastructure. We've moved all the way to number 28 in the world. No, I'm serious. Think about it.

Two, to rebuild the backbone of this country, which is the middle class and hard-working folks. And three, to unite the country."", ""Well, the press legitimately pointed out that the days when Biden was known as the guy who was a bigger uniter in the United States Congress, they're gone.

Thank you, Tammy."", ""And it's great to be with another terrific Member of Congress, Robin Kelly, a champion of women and children not only in her district, but all across America. Seriously.

You picked the phone and called her. You know why? Not only are you a hell of a Congresswoman, you're a nurse. No, I'm serious. There's something special about nurses. Maybe it's because—[applause]—no, no. I genuinely mean it."", 'I, like many of you, have been a considerable consumer of health care in my family, losing family members as well as saving family members. And I spent a lot of time early on with—myself in an ICU, a long time ago.', ""And you know, docs allow you to—let you live. But you know, I often say, if there any angels in heaven, they're all nurses, male and female. Doctors let you live; nurses make you want to live. No, I'm not joking.

And most of those were bipartisan efforts you put together."", 'And by the way, when Lauren does her job, it reminds me of what my dad used to say. He used to say: ""I\'m not looking to the government to solve my problems. I just want them to understand my problems."" She understands. Part of it is just understanding what your constituents need. When you can help, help. And when you can\'t, when there\'s no real answer, tell them the truth and then work like hell to try to find an answer.', ""Folks, I've come to Illinois to talk about two programs that reflect who we are as Americans, that Lauren understands to her core—to her core: Social Security and Medicare. I—quite frankly, I've been in the Congress a long time. I never thought I'd have to make this speech. Did you, Dick, ever think we'd be in this position?"", 'You know, these programs do something so basic and yet so important. You know that after working hard for decades, people deserve to retire, as my dad used to say, with some dignity, a word he most often used. Everyone is entitled be treated with dignity.', ""And the idea that a hard-working person would retire and be in real trouble, deprived of their dignity, is something beyond comprehension to most of us. That's how it should be in the United States."", ""Lauren talks about people she grew up with, with the people she represents. They are, you know, the—they're folks we all know.

And I—she wouldn\'t tell us, but she didn\'t have enough money to pay for some of those prescriptions. And so, to save her pride, I went up and gave them a credit card and said: ""Whatever she has, whatever prescription she has, fill it and say she has enough money and she\'s paying for it. It\'s paid for."" We didn\'t want her to know because she would have said no. Pride. Dignity. Dignity.', ""Imagine a new retiree who recently turned 65. In the past few years, he's been dealing with diabetes, heart disease; he even got a pacemaker. Takes several medicines a day, sometimes as many as 12. A hassle. A hassle. But without Social Security and Medicare, it'd be impossible for him to afford the needs—care he needs."", ""I mean, literally, you know people. Some of you fit this bill. Most folks don't know their Social Security—almost half of all seniors without it—half of all seniors lived in poverty before we had Social Security. Half of the senior population of America.

Social Security and Medicare are more than Government programs, they\'re a promise. They\'re a promise.

And many of these drugs, as a—they come up with are a consequence of Government research. I'm glad they came up with them."", ""For years, we fought to give Medicare the power to negotiate what they pay for prescription drugs, just like we do for the Veterans Administration. The VA has been able to, as they should. So you want to sell us, figuratively speaking—I mean it literally—aspirin a penny apiece? We're only going to pay half a penny. You don't want to sell it to us? We don't—we'll go somewhere else."", 'But for years, Big Pharma has blocked us from being able to negotiate that. They were the only exception out there. But not this year. We finally beat Big Pharma. Finally, finally, finally.', 'Medicare will finally have the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, just like VA. Additionally, seniors will see their out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drugs capped. You know people. Maybe some of you are paying 7-, 8-, 10,000 dollars a year for prescriptions because you have cancer or other serious disease.', 'Well, guess what? Because of the help of this delegation sitting in front of me, we capped that level. No senior, and starting January 1, will have to pay more than $2,000 a year for all their drugs. [Inaudible]—go back. Whether their bills are now 7-, 8-, 10-, 12-, 14,000 dollars a year, no more than $2,000 a year. And the companies will still make a lot of money.', ""Starting in January, we're capping the cost of insulin for seniors with diabetes. How many of you know somebody that needs insulin for their diabetes? Raise your hand. Every audience—see that, Dick? Almost everybody—I would say at least half of this audience raised their hand."", 'You know how much it costs to make that particular—that insulin? It costs $10. T-E-N.', '[At this point, the President picked up a hand-held microphone, moved away from the podium, and continued his remarks as follows.] ', ""Ten dollars to make it. That's it—10. With it packaged——"", '[The microphone malfunctioned.]', ""This isn't working, I guess. [Laughter]"", '[The President returned to the podium, put down the hand-held microphone, and continued his remarks as follows.]', ""With it—they don't want me to wander, I guess. [Laughter]"", ""With it packaged, maybe as much as 15. Well, some of you are paying four or five, six hundred dollars a month for that insulin. Well, guess what? You're not going to have to pay more than $35 a month, period. Thirty-five dollars for one insulin."", 'So, starting in January—one other thing we changed—starting in January, if Big Pharma raises drug prices faster than inflation, they\'re going to have to write a check for the difference to Medicare. What\'s the rationale? This past year, drug companies raised the price on more than one—middle of this ""recession,"" quote, unquote, as Republicans say. It\'s not a recession. But the middle of this, really, turn-down here in terms of expenses that people are paying at the kitchen table.', ""They raised the price of 1,200 drugs higher than the rate of inflation, just last year. We're putting an end to that. Plus, for seniors on Medicare Part D, recommended vaccines like shingles vaccines is going to be available for free. No copay."", ""Last year—last year—more than 2 million seniors got that shingles vaccine at an average price of $100 for it, but some had to pay as much as $200. And you wonder how many seniors skipped the shot because they couldn't afford it. You know, we don't have to make that choice anymore."", ""And we're making hearing aids affordable, finally, for over the counter—[applause]—so people—so you don't have to pay for those expensive visits. The FDA estimates this is going to save as much as $3,000 per pair of hearing aids."", ""And one more thing. For the first time in a decade, seniors' Social Security checks are going to go up, and Medicare is going to come down. First time."", 'Folks, all this hard-won progress is because of your delegation. Not a joke. I wish I could say our Republicans in Congress helped make it happen. But the truth is, every single solitary Democrat in Congress voted for the Inflation Reduction Act. Every single Republican voted against it. Every single one. Not one supported it.', ""And now Republicans are calling to tell us their number-one priority to repeal—is to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act. Everything I just talked about—$2,000 cap on—$2,000 cap on prescription drugs; $35-a-month cap on insulin; more power for Medicare to lower drug prices—all gone. All gone if they succeed. Well, they're not going to succeed, at least for the next 2, because I'll veto it. But—[laughter]."", 'But you know, savings in health care premiums—$800 a month for Americans on the Affordable Care Act, which Lauren worked so hard to get done—will be gone.', ""And of course, there's still the repeal of the Affordable Care Act they're trying to do. The Affordable Care Act is the only reason why tens of millions of people have any coverage because of a preexisting condition. They can't get insurance other than through the Affordable Care Act."", ""And, folks, they're also coming for your Social Security and Medicare."", 'Rick Scott, a Senator from Florida, is in charge of electing Republicans in the Senate, put out a plan that replaces—places Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every 5 years. Every 5 years. And that means, every 5 years, Congress is going to have to vote to cut, completely eliminate, or keep it as it is.', ""This is their little—this is Scott's Republican platform they put out."", '[The President pulled a brochure from the podium.]', 'Let me read from it: ""All Federal legislation sunsets every 5 years. If the law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again."" So every 5 years, you\'re going to have to vote on whether we\'re going to have Social Security anymore—you\'re—or cut it, whatever. Every 5 years.', ""I mean, what is with these guys? Same with Medicare. In other words, it goes out of existence if we don't vote to keep it. Isn't that wonderful?"", ""And then along came Ron Johnson—[laughter]—Senator Johnson from the State of Wisconsin. He thinks waiting every 5 years to try to eliminate Social Security is too long. He thinks Social Security and Medicare should be on the chopping block every single year, along with veterans benefits and everything else in the Federal budget. If Congress doesn't vote to keep it, it goes away. It's gone."", ""You've been paying for this your whole life. Now these guys want to take it away. Who in the hell do they think they are? I really mean it. Think about it. I mean, they're saying it out loud. Did you ever hear, Dick—you think, anybody, that they'd be saying this? We knew where their heart was, but the idea."", ""And what do Republicans want to spend that money on instead? Well, what they want to do—they're really upset with Dick and all of us for making sure that the 55 Fortune 500 companies that paid zero in tax now have to pay a horrible 15 percent in tax."", ""Well, I want to go back—I want to go back here. Look, think about it. Think of what these guys—they want to—they want to make the tax cut that they voted under the last President, that they didn't pay for a penny of it—not a penny of it—they want to make it permanent. They want to continue—they want to slash the number of agents that are out there at IRS to look at their forms."", ""They'd allow some of the largest, most profitable companies in America to go back to paying zero. Like I said, that $2 trillion tax cut, which overwhelmingly benefited major corporations and the wealthiest among us, they want to make sure it's—and by the way, when I ran, I promised you that no one making less than $400,000 a year would have a single penny in their taxes increased. And I've kept that promise. Not a single penny."", ""And, folks, many of us are focused on inflation right now, but if you want to raise the cost of living on seniors, go ahead and give free rein to drug companies. Imagine what that's going to do if we see these prices continue to go up, skyrocket. It's called inflation. And that affects ordinary people every single day."", ""Go ahead and reduce Social Security or Medicare, and watch what happens to the cost of living for hard-working people in Illinois. That's inflation."", ""My dad used to say that when you—if you take a look, at the end of the month, do you have enough money to pay for all your regular bills and have a little breathing room, just a little breathing, a little left over? Well, these guys don't want there to be any breathing room."", ""Now Republicans in Congress are saying they're not going to cooperate in cutting—unless I agree to cooperate in cutting Social Security and Medicare, or they'll shut down the Government."", '[The President took a newspaper from the podium.]', 'The New York Times front page, top of the—says, ""GOP signals plan to shrink Social Security and social""—and it goes on and says, ""Congressional Republicans, eyeing the midterm elections victory . . . could hand them control of the House and Senate, have embraced plans to reduce Federal spending on Social Security and Medicare, including cutting benefits for some retirees and raising the retirement age for both . . . programs."" It goes on.', ""Folks, look, we're not making this stuff up.

Why is it so important?"", ""Well, you know, it's important because 51 means there's no longer 51 Presidents. When you have 50 Senators, everyone is a President. Everyone can make a judgment on what they want to do or not do and—and they can block whatever is coming up."", ""And they're all good people. They're all good people. Joe Manchin is a good person; he really is. But Joe has a different view, and he represents a different constituency than most of us do, especially on environmental issues.

This year. The largest ever occurred in American history.

There\'s no—this radical ""big-spendin\' Democrats.""', ""Like I said, the deficit was highest it's ever been under Trump and was cut the greatest of any administration in American history under the Democrats the last 2 years."", ""And so—and look, I know we still have to worry about inflation.

That—[inaudible]—million barrels of oil—what\'s the price of oil now—gasoline at the pump?', ""For example, down in Georgia, which we're going to be talking about this, the average family has gone from an average cost of $4.98 or $4.87—don't hold me to the exact number—I don't—I'll look—look at my notes—but the high—the high 4's to $2.88. If you have a family with two automobiles, you're saving yourself 170 bucks a month."", 'There\'s more than one way to deal with family inflation. My dad used to say, ""At the end of the day, what do you have left after you pay your—all your monthly bills?""

What's going to follow?"", ""So I—when I started the book—and I decided to run instead. I started the book, I talked about how technology has changed the direction in the world.

There were no Whites in it. And even though the major school—public school, Claymont High School, was a right-hand turn three blocks up.', 'I remember asking my mother why they couldn\'t come—why\'d that bus go all the way downtown?

And the Republican Party, which was the party of DuPont, was very, very restrictive on economic issues, but it was more open.', ""So I joined a group of senior members of the—Democratic Party to try to reform the Democratic Party and move it to more of a Northeastern Democratic Party.

[Laughter] You may be out of the country, but you're going to be working with us. [Laughter]"", ""Any rate. So I just want to—I just want to thank you all. You've been incredible to me.

So, I'm counting on it."", ""And you know, Pennsylvania is—I think Pennsylvania is one of those States where it's kind of unique. It's a very successful State. It's a wealthy State.

And that's who we are."", ""So I'll end by saying: For the longest time, as a young Senator, I heard about trickle-down economics. You know, there used to be—there was a law that was passed in 1934. It was about unions and could they be—were they legal or not, so on and so forth. But the law that ended up being passed said not only are unions legit and they have a right to—you can't artificially stop them from organizing, but they did a second thing."", 'It said that, in the United States of America, if a President is given money from the Congress to do something that is for America—build a new aircraft carrier deck, build a highway, build—whatever it is the money is given for—he should do two things or she should do two things: Number one, make sure they use American products and, number two, American workforce.', ""That was honored in the breach for the vast majority of the years. When I came to office—and the only excuse could be is there weren't workers that could do the job in America and if there weren't materials to be able to do the job."", ""But since I've been President, it's been investing in America. The longest time we spent, including some administrations—even some—[inaudible]—some Democratic administrations."", ""What did we do? Corporate America—and I know a little bit about corporate America, being from Delaware—more corporations incorporated there than every other State in the Union. That's not a joke."", ""But I've always been straight with them. But what did corporate America decide to do? If they had to build something, they found the cheapest labor in the world to build it with. So, they go overseas so they—the labor was cheaper—whether it was to Taiwan, South Korea, wherever it was—and then they'd import the product back home. We changed that. We are making sure we build it here and sending the product over there. And that's why we're working."", 'And for the longest time, you notice, the—the mainstream economists criticized me, said I didn\'t get it right. But guess what they\'re saying now? No, I\'m serious. Not—not the right wing, but even the conservative economists. It\'s working. Invest in—because they started to say: ""This about the government making judgments of what\'s best for the country. Let the free enterprise system do it."" The free enterprise system didn\'t do it as well as we\'re doing it now. It\'s still a free enterprise system. We decide where to invest the money.', 'So thank you for all you\'ve done. We\'re going to do well here in the State because of you. But it gets down to basic things.

What\'s on your mind?"" Because an awful lot of people become very sour. Think about it.', 'It used to be the way we would communicate.

If you look at the percentages of people where they get their news, and there\'s so much on—and it\'s not—you can almost not blame them because so much of what you read is just flat lies.

[Laughter]"", 'When coal died, we moved with my dad—when my dad had moved from Claymont, Delaware—from southern Delaware—northern Delaware to Scranton, and we came back home.', ""But look, even when I was running for Senate and each time I ran, quite frankly—not a joke—Philadelphia, in particular, got me across the line. [Applause] No, I'm not joking. Well, no, I mean it—I mean it, seriously, organizationally and in terms of fundraising, the whole deal."", ""But look, here's the deal. This election is going to be about blocking, tackling—simple, basic politics. Simple. It's going to be a matter of how many signs we get out, how many doors we knock on, how many calls we make, and how many requests we answer."", 'Because, look, the reason I got into this is the same reason you did. You know, they used to have a philosophy in our Government for the longest time, and it—including with some Democrats, of trickle-down economics. If the very wealthy did really well, everybody else would do well, and it would trickle down.', ""Well, my dad was a hard-working guy. My dad was a fine man. Not a whole, whole lot ever trickled down to his kitchen table. So, when I got elected—I mean it sincerely from the bottom of my heart—I decided—and I tried this when I was a Senator, kept pushing it as well, but now it's policy—that we're going to build this economy from the middle out and the bottom up, because if the middle class does well and ordinary people have a shot, everything works. We have the strongest economy in the world. We've got more we have to do though."", ""We have to let people know, first and foremost, we really care about them. I mean, that's basic stuff. That's basic stuff."", ""We've been drawing crowds that have been really big crowds ever since the debate. Not joking. Even that night of the debate, we had great crowds afterwards. And so things are moving. They're moving hard."", 'And look, the other thing is that people want to know you care. They want to know we care. There\'s nothing letting someone know you care like knocking on the door and saying: ""My name is so-and-so. I\'m here for Joe Biden. Is there anything—what do you need? What do you need?""', ""And so there's three things we're working on—three things we're working on to make sure ordinary people get a clear shot."", ""You know, since the election—I'm going to—I'm not going to make this a speech. I'm going to—I promise, John. [Laughter]"", ""By the way, I've got John Fetterman. I don't need much else."", ""But, all kidding aside, you know—what—there's three things people—the economy nationwide is great. The economy internationally is great. We're in the strongest economy in the world. We're leading the world."", ""But ordinary folks, like where I come from in Claymont, Delaware, and Scranton in the three-bedroom, split-level home I grew up in—we weren't poor, but it was always a struggle."", 'My dad used to say: ""A job is about a lot more than a paycheck, Joey. It\'s about your dignity. It\'s about respect. It\'s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, \'It\'s going to be okay.\'"" Everybody—everybody—deserves a shot.', 'And by the way, we\'re making progress. Inflation is down. We\'re moving. But here\'s what ordinary people—and I\'m curious what you\'re hearing when you knocking those doors—they\'re saying: ""Look, grocery prices are too high. They used to—they\'re—I just can\'t afford it."" Well, there\'s a lot of corporate greed going on.', ""Audience member. That's right."", ""The President. No, I'm—and by the way, I come from the corporate State of the world: Delaware. Okay? More corporations incorporated in my State than every other State in the Union combined. Okay? So I'm not anticorporation, I'm just about fairness."", ""So three things I'm going to do: I'm going to change the tax system. The wealthy are going to have to start paying their fair share."", ""You know, I did it—remember we had that whole thing about those 55 corporations that paid zero in taxes? Well, they saw they couldn't do anything about it. Well, I did get something done about it. I—but I was only able to raise their tax to 15 percent. You'd all trade for that price—right?—15 percent."", ""But we raised more money that paid for all the programs we have. We've actually cut the deficit. The things we're doing, and he wants to take away, like health care and what we're trying to do in terms of—what we are doing in terms of taking on Big Pharma."", ""Big Pharma is in position where they're charging exorbitant prices. If you know anybody that has diabetes, ask them what it's like now paying 35 instead of 400 bucks a month."", ""The bottom line is, there's nothing we can't do if we focus on who the hell we are. We're the United States of America. I really mean this. Work together, there's not a damn thing we can't do."", ""We've got a hell of a team running this time out. I just spoke to Dwight. He's going to be running statewide again."", ""And Pennsylvania is a critically important State—critically important State. And so I'm counting on you. I'm heading from here to Harrisburg."", ""By the way, no one has ever had as much organized labor support as I have. I'm going— [applause]—and they're full-bore in: operating engineers. [Applause] No, I'm serious."", ""I'm the most pro-union Senator [President; White House correction] in the history of the United States of America. I make no damn apologies for it, because when they do well, everybody does well."", ""But anyway, look, I just want to say thank you, thank you, thank you. It's all about touching people. It's all about talking, all about finding what's on their minds. That's the thing I miss most."", ""I love the Secret Service, by the way. [Laughter] They're great. No, no, no. No, they really are. But I'm not able to do what I used to do. I'd be riding down the street in this—in the vehicle before and see a bunch of kids in the schoolyard waving, I'd stop and get out. Realistically, I can't do that anymore. It's just too dangerous what's going on out there."", 'But the point is, we—I just—the thing I miss most is just looking people in the eye. If you want to know what someone is thinking, you say: ""My name is Joe Biden. What\'s on your mind, Nicole?"" And by the way—and by the way, you can tell by looking in their eyes.', 'So, folks, let them know we care. You have all the details, all the—and by the way——', 'Audience member. We need Dark Brandon back. [Laughter]', ""Audience member. He's got his glasses."", 'Audience member. Oh, the glasses!', ""The President. I've got my glasses and—well, I tell you what: Dark Brandon is coming back. He's here."", ""And guess what? The next 120-something days or so, they're going to get a real good look at who Donald Trump is."", 'Anyway, thank you, thank you, thank. Maybe I can just talk to you. Thank you.', 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', ""The President. By the way, folks, if you're in a—if you're ever in a foxhole, the guy you want next to you is this guy here, John."", ""Senator John K. Fetterman. There is only one person in this room that kicked Trump's ass in an election."", ""There is only one person in this State that has kicked Trump's ass in an election."", ""There is only one person in the country that's ever kicked Trump's ass in an election, and that is your President. That's our President. That's your President. That's my President."", ""Four years ago—4 years ago—we were hoarding toilet paper. We would all be doing this in Zoom right now. You know? Or if it wasn't for Joe Biden, Trump would be at the White House, and he'd be campaigning for his third term."", 'You know, think about that——', 'Audience member. [Inaudible]—already installed himself there.', ""Sen. Fetterman. Yes. It's just like, Joe Biden has held every line that he needed to do, and he has."", ""I—am—I—you know, I know what it's like to have a rough debate, and I'm standing right here, you know, as your Senator."", ""An amazing President—and I want to just say how I'm so proud I am to stand with the President, and I know all of you is in again. And we already knew this was going to be close. We knew is going to be close in 2016, going to be close in 2020. Twenty twenty-four, nothing has changed other than it's going to be close."", ""And again, I want to remind everybody: There is only one guy that has ever beaten Trump, and he's going to do it twice and put him down for go."", ""The President. And by the way, she may not be as tall. [Laughter] She—she may not be as powerful looking. But she's Irish, and so am I. [Laughter] And she's tough. Madeleine Dean."", ""Representative Madeleine C. Dean. Oh, I am delighted to be here with the President of the United States, Pennsylvania's own Joseph R. Biden."", ""I can't top what our beautiful introduction said, Noëlle—is it Noëlle?

We know there's one man of character, integrity, and accomplishment. And we know there's one man who was a crook, a criminal, corrosive to our democracy."", ""I was there on January 6 and had to be taken out of the Capitol in a gas mask to I don't know where as American citizens, incited by a President, came and attacked the Capitol, using the American flag, beating police officers."", ""Democracy is on the line.

He was a Bronze Star, Conspicuous Service Medal, spent a year in Iraq, volunteered to go with his unit when the -- when he went he was the attorney general of the state of Delaware. And so, I decided I wasn't going to get engaged in -- in public -- I -- I wasn't going to run again. I had been vice president. I was a professor -- a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania at the time."", ""And what happened was that I -- I was going to stay out of it. But then what happened was, remember down in Charlottesville, Virginia, when those folks came out of the woods carrying torches and Nazi banners and literally singing the same Nazi c- -- anyway, the same songs sung in -- in Germany in the '30s? And a young woman was killed who was a -- a bystander. And that young woman, I met -- I talked to the mother."", 'And the press contacted Trump and asked him -- they said, ""Well, what do you think?""

I'm optimistic. We've done -- I'm going to say something that's going to sound awful. The press is here, so I'm gong to say it in front of them. I think most of the political historians say I've gotten more done than most presidents have since Franklin Roosevelt in terms of fundamental changes and -- and, by the way, in the process, all this is going on, we saved money.
