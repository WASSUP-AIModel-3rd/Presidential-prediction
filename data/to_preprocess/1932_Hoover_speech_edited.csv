0,Herbert Hoover ,"November 02, 1932","['I am speaking tonight to our California association in this city and to my fellow Californians and my friends in Oregon and Washington over the telephone and radio.', 'I find myself speaking with no feeling of being removed or apart from the people at home in my own State. There is no separation of time or distance which the longing of the heart and mind cannot span between those whose common experience in daily living, fundamental aspirations and ideals give common sympathy and common understanding.', 'The telephone and the radio which convey my voice to you across the continent are not quicker in their errand than is the spirit which prompts the message they bring to you.', 'It is almost 48 years since I came as a boy to Oregon where, under the tender care of my uncle, I spent 7 years amid the glories of the Willamette Valley, and it was there that I began to earn my own living. Still a boy I, 40 years ago, came to California in search of an engineering education, with little means beyond the savings I had made. That opportunity was made possible for me by a citizen of California in the endowment of Stanford University free of tuition.', ""After having worked in the mines of California with my own hands, through the same gentle kindliness of another great citizen of California, I was started on my professional career. A great chance came to me through the world leadership California had attained in the mining industry, and I participated in responding to the demand of foreign countries for the training and skill that California had developed in that profession. I have never gone so far away, nor remained so long, except during the Great War and the Presidency, that the homing instinct has not carried me back every year to sink more deeply and more firmly the roots of my being in the fertile soil of California's spiritual and cultural life."", 'During the 4 years of the Great War, I represented the United in great enterprises which brought credit and distinction to our country and to my State. But I was deprived during those years of return to my home. Fearful that my sons should grow up without that imprint of California; that they might fail in touch with their own people, they with their mother spent a large part of that period in our California home, to be educated there in the prime school of democracy-our public schools.', 'After the war we came home with the hope and long-treasured enterprise of every normal American family of building a new house. I am not one of those Californians whose heart needs the awakening influence of absence to quicken his appreciation of the State of his birth or adoption. When sooner or later the time arrives which permits me to do so, I propose to return to my home in Palo Alto to live with my fellow Californians.', ""Elevated to the Presidency of the United States as a son of California, it has been my task to contend with the greatest peacetime disaster which has ever come to the American people. That crisis has extended over every hour and every day for the whole of the last 2 years. It has not so far permitted me to be away from the nerve center of the Nation, the headquarters of a great battle, a distance of more than a night's journey."", 'Our family has each year made fond plans for return to spend a summer at our own home for normal change and relief from work, but new crises and new emergencies have compelled me to remain at the Capital of the Nation. The improved situation in the country affords me the deep satisfaction of coming home to vote, but not for the purpose of carrying on a political campaign amongst my neighbors, who are my friends, but to satisfy that proper instinct inherent in every American to cast his vote amongst his neighbors at his own home. I trust I may not be prevented from exercising this privilege.', 'My friends, in addressing you tonight as a Californian, I am asking you for support in this contest because, in the outcome of this fight for the Republican Party, the people of the State of California have a great stake. I am addressing the people of Oregon and Washington because they, too, might be faced with the sacrifices of their most vital interests.', 'No more serious moment has ever brought the people of California and myself together in counsel as friends and neighbors than that which challenges us now. California has been honored by the Nation with its leadership during a period even more dangerous than a great war. I do not take seriously the claims of our opponents, however loudly voiced, that California will contribute to the responsibility of interrupting that leadership to the Nation which California has itself provided.', 'I do not need to remind Californians of the stages by which this crisis developed. While our opponents lay it largely to the mania of speculation, which indeed did contribute, all Californians know the ease with which our own State has time and again recuperated from such reverses by a short wait for the solid forces of growth to catch up with the over advancement and overdevelopment of hope and enterprise.', 'Our opponents further claim that this great calamity was also due to increases in the tariff. Pacific Coast States can scarcely agree to this idea because they themselves were among the largest beneficiaries from these increases.', 'The Democratic candidate stated at Seattle: ""When this tariff was passed with its outrageous rates, these laws started us on the road where we now find ourselves and that is the road of ruin.""', 'He further states: ""Here on the Pacific coast it has had a destructive effect in our oriental trade.""', 'He repeated at Sacramento: ""I have called immediate attention to the tariff that has done so much to destroy foreign trade by making foreign trade virtually impossible. I called for consideration of means by which trade with the Orient, which has so largely been destroyed, may be restored.""', 'In the face of the facts no one has a right to broadcast such statements blaming the people of the Pacific coast. I may mention after that tariff bill was passed our exports to China increased from $80 million in the fiscal year 1931 to $93 million in the fiscal year 1932; exports to Japan increased from $146 million in the fiscal year 1931 to $240 million in the fiscal year 1932. And even this is not the whole story, for if we were to analyze the effect of the decrease in world prices we would find on a quantity basis that our oriental trade is even larger than is shown by dollar valuation. While our opponent is ignorant of the facts he reveals his hostility to the tariffs on Pacific coast products.', 'In fact, the true cause of the real calamity which interrupted our entry into the road of recovery some 18 months ago lies deep in the World War and its aftermath, the inability of Europe to longer stand the strain without enormous readjustments of debts, overexpansion of armaments, et cetera, which finally brought about economic collapse of 30 nations. In every quarter of the globe confidence, which is the foundation of the faith on which the economic structure is builded, crumbled; business came to a standstill; European institutions, with a hundred years of financial stability, collapsed; European social order received such reverses that the whole structure of civilization was at one time on the brink of chaos, collapse, and ruin, and we alone held the last fortress of stability in the world. The invasion of this army of fear destroyed confidence, sapping the defenses of our financial system and stifling our exports of goods to those nations, threatened to bring down our entire industrial and commercial structure.', 'This was the new world war, a war of fearful and invisible enemies. Its spectral hosts, recruited in Europe and gathering allies from every land, turned their final march of assault upon our shores and even upon our Pacific Coast States.', 'As the responsible head of the Nation, I, following the historic policy of our past, abjured partisanship. I called for national unity in the face of national danger; I set before the leaders of both parties a complete program of measures for national defense and recovery. To the credit of my countrymen, they answered this call with almost complete unanimity; many patriotic Democrats in the Congress aligned themselves with patriotic Republicans under the banner of a united nation.', 'I need not recite the long series of over 30 measures initiated by my administration to sustain wages and employment; to prevent hunger and cold among millions of men, women, and children; to hold impregnable our Government credit as the basis of all stability to maintain the structure of private credit system through the Federal Reserve System, the Reconstruction Corporation, the land banks, the agricultural banks, home loan banks, the Farm Board; the expansion in public works; the mobilization of cooperation in all parts of our country; and a score of other activities. Their whole purpose was to hold the Nation steady in this crisis and to maintain the validity of the deposits of our people in the banks, the savings, the insurance policies of our people, and to hold the jobs for those who had work, to care for the distressed, and keep the economic machine functioning until the hurricane was passed. These actions saved this Nation from a score of years of destructive degeneration.', 'Nor were these dangers just general to the Nation. These invasions swept from State to State and from city to city throughout the country. It was a battle not alone against a nationwide startling growth of fear but against local and separate dangers in which at times each one of our Pacific Coast States has been the object of acute anxiety and direct action on the part of the Federal Government in their defense.', 'One great difficulty which arose to halt our progress was the development by the Democratic House of Representatives and the allies which they had secured to themselves of a series of disastrous measures for vast raids on the Public Treasury, the issuance of greenback money, and other interferences with the currency. The flank attacks had to be fought, coincident with fighting a hundred battles on the whole economic front, and they delayed the effectiveness of our potent measures for recovery until the Democratic House of Representatives and their allies adjourned. Our opponents at no time have proposed a single constructive measure to meet this emergency.', 'Finally, confidence being restored, we have been able to mobilize these measures into counterattack on the depression. Since the adjournment of Congress a million men have returned to work, new courage and enterprise have come into the lives and souls of men, and again America has begun the march forward which she has moved over these 150 years. The poignant question which citizens are asking today is whether we are going to check this progress and subject harried business, employment, and agriculture to a new term of waiting and uncertainty by the threat of new policies which are destructive in character both in the short and long view of our Nation.', 'I cannot better illustrate the measures of defense and attack than to point to a few of their applications to our Pacific Coast States.', 'Bear in mind that the head of a nation has the obligation to exert equal concern for the necessities of every State. I use this illustration merely to bring home to my neighbors and friends in the West the practical application to them of the vast program we have put in motion.', 'No man can say I was unmindful of the Pacific Coast States when immediately upon taking office and in the face of every prophecy and every precedent of political disaster to Presidents who demand tariff revisions, I called Congress into special session for upward revision of all farm tariffs, including the products of every farm, orchard, ranch, and garden in California and the other Pacific Coast States. And, further, that I secured the support of Republican States not interested in the setting up of the oil and lumber tariffs, so that we gained for these industries and their workers a much-needed relief to their unemployment.', 'There are no States in the Union where prosperity is so dependent upon the maintenance of the protective tariff as in those of the Pacific coast. There is scarcely a commodity now produced within your borders that could be produced on a commercial basis tomorrow if we were to take down the barriers which prevent a flood of goods outside our boundaries from the North, the South, across the Atlantic and the Pacific.', 'You are familiar with the proofs. I need recite but a few. For instance, southern California should be interested that lemons can be laid down in New York from Europe at $3.50 a box, while through tariff protection California is able to sell her product for $6.50. Petaluma is interested that the import of over 3-million dozens of eggs has dropped to 300,000 this year under Republican tariff, and through the recent order I signed in connection with dried eggs upon the determination of facts by the Tariff Commission we saved that industry. New Zealand butter could be sold at this moment over the whole Pacific coast at less than 14 cents per pound; similar grades of butter bring 22 cents per pound because of the tariff. Against Asiatic beans the tariff has afforded, during the last 2 years, a nearly 100 percent protection for the Pacific coast farmer. Raisins and figs of Fresno and prunes of the Willamette and Santa Clara Valleys would sell in the common markets of the East at rates that would, despite the low level of present prices, reduce returns to those producers by nearly 50 percent. The price of California wool in the Boston market is 38 cents today, whereas your Australian competitors could sell the same kind of wool there for less than 22 cents, and the difference is due solely to the tariff.', 'It is not difficult to gauge the shallow hypocrisy of Democratic pretentions of tariff consideration in behalf of the Pacific coast farmer. The same story could be told of every farm product--nuts, grapes, melons, tomatoes, celery, and a score of commodities.', 'Turning to another of our great coast products, 60 cents out of each dollar produced in the Pacific Coast Northwest comes from the forests, where higher wages are paid to lumber workers than in any other district in the world. Since the passage of the tariff act, British Columbian lumber exports into the United States have almost disappeared, and those from Russia, which had rapidly developed into a large trade, have almost ceased.', 'I would like to repeat here a statement made on Friday, October 28, by Mr. W. D. Euler, former National Minister of Canada and now a Member of the Canadian House of Commons. He said:', '""I have no particular love for our American friends so far as business is concerned, but I would not cut off my nose to spite my face. It may be that after the next election--and it looks that way--the United States Government may change its attitude, and you may find President Roosevelt, if he is elected, making certain proposals possibly as to allowing our lumber to come into that country, or our fish, or something else.""', 'And this protection afforded to Pacific coast industries by the tariff of 1930 and since has become doubly imperative within the last few months, due to depreciation of currencies as a part of the world collapse. As many of you know, due to a more than 50 percent depreciation in Japanese currency since last spring, the competitors of our Pacific coast fish industries, which employ nearly 90,000 workers and have an invested capital of more than $103 million, have been confronted with the gravest peril. As a result of this depreciation of currency, foreign salmon is now quoted at about half the price of our Pacific coast product. Our imports of canned sardines, which come largely from depreciated currency countries, were almost 90 percent larger in September of this year than in September 1931. And other branches of our important Pacific coast industries, such as canned vegetables, dried fruits, beans and pulp, iron and steel may also be threatened with a similar peril.', 'In the light of this grave emergency, I have asked the Tariff Commission to investigate the situation immediately and, if the findings warrant, I shall at once increase the protection to these industries. The fact is, we on the Pacific coast are faced with the necessity to consider increases in the tariff instead of the proposals of the Democratic Party to reduce them. Our citizens should not be fooled by promises of local Democratic candidates not to reduce these tariffs.', 'Every man who knows the constitution, the character platform, and the traditional policy of the Democratic Party knows perfectly well that these products will rot on the farms and in our forests of the Pacific coast under such a regime. Furthermore, it must be obvious that the progress the Pacific coast has made from the crisis in certain industries toward upward movement of the last 4 months would wither under any such proposal. We would go back to conditions of depression worse than that through which we have passed.', 'I would call your attention to another phase of the tariff question, that is, the proposal of negotiated reciprocal tariff by the Democratic Party. I have just examined again the protests which were lodged with the State Department at the time of the increases in our tariff 2 years ago. I find that protests were made by 40 different countries. They are nothing new. They occur with every tariff bill, and the Democrats always ventilate them as being threats to our national welfare just as the Democratic candidate did while in our State. I found, however, that these protests in large part relate to items of interest to the Pacific Coast States: wool, hides, tomatoes, lettuce, celery, onions, potatoes, carrots, cattle, hogs, butter, cheese, eggs, canned goods, canned fish, sugar, preserved cherries, oranges, lemons, raisins and dried fruits, apples, olive oil, beans, peas, cement, pottery manufactures, iron and steel manufactures, lumber, and oil.', 'No reciprocal agreement would be made with these countries at all except at the expense of the Pacific Coast States. Because we have determined to protect the civilization upon which the Coast States rest, and their distance from States of predominant interest to that party, the Democratic candidate tells us that we have been unjust to foreign nations and that we have brought calamities on all other States and the world by our insistence upon your protection.', 'To indicate the practical application of our measures to protect the Pacific coast from destruction in this crisis and to advance that recovery, I may cite a few of the direct applications to California, Oregon, and Washington.', 'The National Credit Association and the Reconstruction Corporation at one time advanced over $150 million to some 409 banks, including branches, in the State of California; to 62 in Oregon; and to 99 in Washington. This sum has been largely repaid. Those banks have more than 3 million depositors, every one of whom was helped by these loans which were made solely for the purpose of protecting their deposits and savings, and of preventing undue pressure on borrowers from those banks during the period of panic. Had these advances not been made your entire banking system would have collapsed beyond any doubt. But this action has tided over the panic, has reestablished the banking system of the Pacific coast again on a sound basis, and has kept practically every family from despair at loss of their deposits.', 'I may call attention to the fact that during this period loans were made to 24 different building and loan associations on the Pacific coast and to 5 mortgage concerns, with a view to preventing foreclosure of mortgages on the homes and farms of hundreds of thousands of people.', 'The Federal Farm Board, created by my activities, has advanced to California farm cooperatives a total of $31,298,000 to prevent their collapse in this time of distress and thus aided hundreds of thousands of families. On top of this, in order to aid in employment, the Federal Government has expended, during my administration, on and let contracts for public works, buildings, roads, and other items $100 million in California, $45 million in Oregon, and $50 million in Washington. This has provided work for hundreds of thousands.', 'Beyond this again the Reconstruction Corporation, under provisions for advancing employment through reproductive works, has authorized advances to great projects in the Pacific Coast States which were held in abeyance because of the credit paralysis, such as the San Francisco-Oakland Bridge, the bringing of Colorado River water into southern California--which enterprises will finally expend upwards of $400 million for the invigoration of the industries of California and the whole of the Nation. Beyond this the Reconstruction Corporation has authorized loans to States on the Pacific coast for the care of distress among unemployed.', 'Under these measures which I have inaugurated, we have set up new agricultural credit banks on the Pacific coast in order that there shall be no question as to the ability of our farmers to borrow money for productive purposes. We have set up new home loan banks in those States in order that we may protect and expand the activities of the building and loan associations and savings banks, not alone to protect homeowners from foreclosure but to free capital with which new homes can be built and new labor employed.', 'These great actions by the use of Federal credit to tide Pacific Coast States across the trough of this depression reflect directly and indirectly into every home and fireside in those States.', 'These measures which I have cited are but a partial picture of the reasons why I have not been able, during the whole of these 4 years, to renew the friendships and those associations in my home State, or even to have the pleasure of attending the Olympic games.', 'In all the stress of these past years, especially in these past few weeks when we have been battling that the rehabilitation of this Nation may be carried forward without interruption, nothing has been more heartening than the messages of confidence and hope that I have received from the mobilized women of California. I realize that when difficulties come of the character we have been meeting it is the women who first feel the effects of economic pressures on their shoulders, the burden of thousands of small economies that must be made for the preservation of the home and the safety of the children. They are proving the great steadying influence in the Nation, the great preservers. They will refuse to risk the fate of their families through the abandonment of those safeguards which we have builded during the past 150 years or to risk the programs of reconstruction we have inaugurated, by the adoption of the proposals of the Democratic Party which will inherently destroy it. I should like to pay a tribute to the organization of your young voters who are fighting this battle with us to such telling effect.', 'I have been requested by the Republican State Committee to comment on two calumnies being circulated by the Democratic agents in my home State. I had not supposed it necessary, but I can do so categorically. As to the first calumny, I have not, since I entered public service 15 years ago, owned any interest directly or indirectly in any kind of business outside of the boundaries of the United States, including any concern producing, transporting, or distributing oil. Twenty years ago I invested $5,000 in the California Oil Company, and I still have it. The second defamation that I am asked to denounce which has been industrially circulated is to the effect that the ranch at Wasco, my interest in which I disposed of 2 or 3 years ago, refused to employ white workers. To support this cheap political trick, a notice was prepared and hung on the gates and photographed for circulation despite repeated public statements of its fraudulent character by various substantial men.', 'I might add one further note of interest to the Pacific Coast States. Repeatedly in these last 4 years in illustrating what may be accomplished under the American System of government, and by a virile people, I have pointed out publicly and privately, time and again, the great example of the Pacific Coast States, an empire to itself--where 8 million people have settled in a period of less than 85 years, have builded a state of society in which there has been a degree of comfort, an addition to the sum total of human possessions, a diffusion of wealth, and a security that is not exceeded by any similar area on the face of the globe, no matter how old. And where, with it all, they have advanced in education and intellectual pursuits to the degree that the total number of students in institutions of higher learning amongst only 8 million people, is greater than the attendance in similar institutions in the whole of Great Britain with its population of 45 million.', 'I am asking you should vote to maintain our American institutions which have given you this well-being, not halt them because of temporary dissatisfactions with forces outside the control of our Government. And it is my purpose tonight to bring to your minds that this march and progress should not be halted nor destroyed.', 'I do not hesitate to ask you to so express your citizenship next Tuesday as to insure the continuance of this progress, which over the years has made California what it is. It must not deter me from the solemn duty of appealing to you to vote on the basis of the constructive measures and policies of the Republican Party which have protected you from great disasters in the past and have turned the country toward recovery and not allow your votes to be inspired by misrepresentations and general and special appeals to discontent with temporary forces forced upon us from abroad rather than your own well-being.']",0
1,Herbert Hoover ,"November 03, 1932","['Friends in Connellsville:', 'I find it difficult to express the very great appreciation that both Mrs. Hoover and I have for your coming in such enormous numbers to greet us here this morning. It is the most generous and the most courteous reception that we have received. It is heartening and encouraging. And it is an indication of what the people of Connellsville will do on the 8th of November next.', 'I thank you for coming.']",0
2,Herbert Hoover ,"November 04, 1932","['[1.] NAPPANEE, INDIANA (7:25 a.m.)', 'My friends:', 'I want to express to you the appreciation I have for your coming out so early and coming down to the station to give us this greeting. It is encouraging, and it is very heartening. And it is a good sign of what you will be likely to do on the 8th day of November. This is not an occasion for a political address or a discussion of national issues. I am going to try to do that at 3:30 this afternoon and again at 7:30 tonight, and as most of you, I have no doubt, are able to get to the radio, you will hear a lot of it then.', '[2.] WELLSBORO, INDIANA (Water stop)', ""I have to get up pretty early to do my job ordinarily, but you get up earlier than I do. Don't you think this is pretty early in the morning to begin to make a speech ? I am grateful for your coming down to give a greeting like this. It is very encouraging, and it is heartening. And it is a sign of what you are likely to do on the 8th of November. At 3:30 this afternoon you will be able to hear something of a speech more than I can make on this occasion."", '[3.] WOODVILLE, INDIANA (8:40 a.m.)', 'I certainly appreciate your coming to give me this greeting. It shows you get up as early in the morning as I do to do my job. I greatly appreciate it. It is heartening, and it is encouraging. And it is a sign of what you will do on the 8th of November.', '[4.] GARY, INDIANA (9 a.m.)', 'I doubt whether any President has ever received such a greeting as you are giving to me this morning. I appreciate it. It is heartening. It is encouraging in this fight. It is an indication of the action which you will take on the 8th day of November.', 'We have passed through 3 long years of national crisis. These difficulties of our Nation were brought on us from abroad. The administration in Washington has taken unprecedented measures calling into action the full powers of the Federal Government in the protection of our people from this invasion. We have succeeded in the defense of our people from the invasion of fear and interference from abroad, and we have preserved the institutions of the United States. We first fought a great battle of defense. We have turned our great instrumentalities and measures into an offensive all along the economic front and are restoring employment and agriculture to the United States. We are able at this moment to say to you that men are returning to their jobs at the rate of 500,000 per month, that, since the adjournment of the Democratic House of Representatives and the cessation of their interferences with our program of recovery, we have returned over 1 million men to their jobs.', 'There is one fundamental difference between our program and that of our opponents that is absolutely fundamental to all of you, that is, the continued protection of our industries from foreign goods. If it were not for the protective tariff today there would be millions more unemployed in our country. If we were to let down the tariff barriers which surround you and which protect you, we should have a new and worse depression.', 'It is the most potent of all the emergency measures in protection of our people, and yet our opponents propose to reduce that protection. They propose to reduce it at a time when, in the economic debacle among other nations of the world, currencies have depreciated and brought lowered standards of living and lower wages to them, your competitors. They are able to penetrate our tariff wall in many places. The Tariff Commission is at present engaged in investigating these questions. Through it we may be able to repair these breaks which today are depriving the American workman of his employment and decreasing the prices to the American farmer. Our opponents have proposed in this campaign that they will abolish the authority which was established to the Tariff Commission to act in these emergencies. And not only do they propose to reduce the tariff but they propose to destroy the means of readjustment when it becomes necessary to preserve your jobs.', 'If the protective tariff is to be maintained and if the policies of the Republican Party of restricting immigration so that our own people may be employed are to be maintained, it rests with you, the workingmen and workingwomen of the United States. It can be done solely and only by the return of the Republican Party to power on the 8th day of November. If you desire a change by which the tariff on which your jobs are built shall be reduced, if you desire a change by which immigration shall be allowed to reenter the United States to compete for jobs at the gates of your factories, you have only to vote for our opponents. We are fighting against. these changes. We are fighting for the protection of the American people in their homes and firesides. We have no other interest than to maintain the stability of our own country and restore its employment from the shocks which it has received from outside our borders. We have builded up protection to you in a score of directions, and those protections and those measures are at this moment working steadily for the restoration of our country.', 'Now, I want again to express my appreciation for the support which you have shown by your gigantic welcome this morning. I have never seen so great a crowd gathered at such a time, and it is a demonstration that the Republican Party will be returned on the 8th day of November to complete its task.', '[5.] GRESHAM JUNCTION, ILLINOIS (9:42 a.m.)', 'My friends:', 'I deeply appreciate this greeting. It is encouraging. It is heartening, and it is evidence as to where you will stand in this State on the 8th day of November next.', 'You will realize that this is hardly an occasion for a long discussion of national issues. I have to speak twice during the day today, once at Springfield at about 3:30 and again in St. Louis at 7:30, and I am in hopes you may be able to listen on the radio. I do have something to say on those two occasions, and I know you would like for me to preserve my voice so as to be able to get it across.', 'Thank you.', '[6.] JOLIET, ILLINOIS (10:35 a.m.)', 'My friends:', 'I have had receptions of a dimension, since coming into this State, that have been almost unparalleled in the history of Presidential campaigns, and I deeply appreciate your greeting. It is heartening. It is encouraging, and it is stimulating to continue this fight. And it is a profound indication of where the Republican State of Illinois will be on the 8th day of November.', 'I am confident that the State of our Union that gave us the first Republican President is going to maintain the Republican Party in the guidance of the policies of this Government.', 'You will realize that this is not an opportunity for a long discussion of our national issues. I am speaking at Springfield at 3:30 this afternoon, and I am speaking again at St. Louis at 7:30 tonight. I know that most of you have access to the radio. I hope you will listen in because I am going to have something to say with regard to our opponents and the policies they propose for the American people.', 'This town among all towns has had much from the Republican Party. It has protection to its industries, and it has protection in a double sense today, through not only the present tariff but its protection through a Republican agency created in the last tariff bill, by which breaches which are being made today in the tariff wall can be repaired. They will not be repaired by the Democratic Party, who propose to reduce those tariffs and to increase unemployment in the United States thereby. And those breaches must be repaired to protect the American people in our factories. Therefore, our problem today is not the reduction proposed by our opponents, but it is the very large question as to whether it is necessary to increase the tariff in order to make more jobs for our factories and our farms.', 'My friends, we have gone through 3 years of difficult times. These times have brought great hardships. They have come upon us as the aftermath of the World War and the collapse of 30 nations abroad from that war. We have established instrumentalities and measures by which we have protected the United States from infinitely worse conditions than those with which we have been confronted, and we have turned those measures to an attack upon the economic situation. The result has begun to show since the adjournment of the Democratic House of Representatives. We have now had 4 months in which to see the results of those measures established by the Republican administration for meeting this battle.', 'I am glad to give to you this today, to carry some conviction to you, and that one figure is that in the last 4 months 1 million men have been returned to their jobs.', 'I thank you again for your greeting. It is the most impressive evidence of where your heart lies, and that is in the Republican Party.', '[7.] MORRIS, ILLINOIS (11:04 a.m.)', 'My friends:', 'I am afraid I cannot undertake to make myself heard over all parts of this tremendous crowd. I have to save my voice for this afternoon at Springfield and tonight at St. Louis, but I do want to express my appreciation for this greeting. It is a sign of what you will do on November 8th.', '[8.] Ottawa, ILLINOIS (11:35 a.m.)', 'My friends:', 'I find it difficult to assemble the words to express the appreciation I have for such greetings as have been given to me since I came into the State of Illinois this morning. It is heartening and encouraging and a sure sign of what will happen on November 8th--that the State of Illinois, which furnished the first Republican President of the United States, will continue to be under Republican leadership.', 'I will speak to you this afternoon from Springfield. I trust many of you have radios, so that you can listen in. I am going to speak to you tonight from St. Louis, and I have to conserve my voice in the open air, so that I can give the impressions which I have of our opponents with the vigor which they deserve.', 'I thank you for your greeting.', '[9.] LASALLE, ILLINOIS (12 noon)', 'My friends:', 'I do want to express my appreciation for this tremendous greeting. It is heartening, and it is encouraging. It is a sign of what you will do on the 8th day of November.', 'I thank you.', '[10.] HENRY, ILLINOIS ( 12:45 p.m.)', 'I want to express my appreciation for this greeting. It is encouraging, and it is a great stimulation to continue the fight. And it is a sound indication as to what Illinois will do on the 8th day of November.', 'Thank you.', '[11.] PEORIA, ILLINOIS ( 1:30 p.m.)', 'This is unquestionably the greatest assembly of citizens at a railway station yet in history. I find it difficult to formulate the words which express my gratitude for your greeting. It is encouraging. It is heartening in this battle, and it is evidence of where the State of Illinois will be on the 8th day of November.', 'This is not a time to discuss at length our national issues. Within 2 or 3 hours I shall be able to talk to you by radio from Springfield and again this evening from St. Louis. I have one point of which I always wish to remind both the citizens of the town and the citizens of the country, and that is that in these terrible times--and I use the word advisedly--the Republican Party has given a protection to this country from collapses that would have endangered this Nation to a degree of which you have no comprehension. We have turned our great instrumentalities and those unprecedented measures now into complete attack upon the depression. We are moving forward. We are succeeding. Over a million of men have returned to work during the past 4 months, and they are returning to work at the rate of half a million a month. That is the evidence of the success of the great program which the Republican Party offers to this country.', 'Our opponents are offering you no emergency program. They are giving you some vague promises with regard to the future. The real problem of the American people is to get out of this depression, to restore men to their jobs, and to restore to agriculture their prices. That is the problem upon which our party has concentrated itself. That is the battle in which we are engaged. We have carried the first-line trenches, and we say to you that this is no time to change policies and strategies until we have won this battle complete.', 'Now, I wish I could more adequately express the appreciation which I have for this greeting. It is the most impressive group that has yet greeted me at any point in the United States, and some of the groups have been most encouraging indeed. I see in your faces and by your looks that we will carry the State of Illinois and by so doing you carry the Nation.']",0
3,Herbert Hoover ,"November 04, 1932","['My friends:', ""No man can come to Springfield without a long look backward in our history. No man can visit this national shrine without reflecting once more on its significance in the life of our Republic. No man can live in Washington without constant reminder of the great struggle that determined our country's destiny. And no man in my position can fail to gain inspiration and courage from the courage, the high intelligence, the unswerving fidelity with which Abraham Lincoln met the overwhelming difficulties that threatened the very existence of our Union. I thank you for the privilege of renewing contact with that shrine."", 'At Des Moines a month ago I made an address largely directed to agriculture. I elaborated some 12 points which I can summarize again, with the progress made in respect to them since that time, and I can now add the apparent reactions upon the Democratic candidate in respect to that statement.', 'The first of the subjects I discussed at that time was the tariff in its relation to American agriculture. Since that speech, the Democratic candidate has made further statements as to which he can only confuse the public mind and from which I do not believe American agriculture will secure much conviction. It is, of course, difficult for the Democratic Party to maintain one theory on the tariff in the East and another in the West. But of one thing you can be sure, and that is that the party which placed the majority of farm products on the free list in the tariff bill which they imposed on the country in 1913; the party which voted against the emergency farm tariff in 1921; the party of the Democratic President who vetoed it; the party of the Democratic minority in the succeeding House which voted against the revival of the emergency tariff, although it was forced through by a Republican majority and a Republican President; the party which voted against the increase in the agricultural tariffs in the Republican tariff bill of 1922, and the party which voted against the increase in the farm tariffs in the Hawley Smoot tariff bill of 1930; the party whose platform enunciated the principle of competitive tariff for revenue, and the candidate who unceasingly has reaffirmed that platform and who denounces the Hawley Smoot tariff in unmeasured terms, notwithstanding that 66 percent of the dutiable goods under that act are farm products, and who has termed it frequently a ghastly jest, are scarcely the party and the candidate upon whom the Republican farmers of Illinois should depend for their protection. Certainly whatever they may now say in words in the West, they depend upon their historical low tariff policy to carry conviction in the East.', 'Moreover, I have not yet noticed that the Democratic candidate has abandoned his notion of what he calls ""negotiated tariffs"" with other governments. I have reexamined the protests which are always lodged by other nations every time we pass a protective tariff bill, and in fact all nations lodge similar protests when one of them passes a tariff bill. I find that all but a few of those protests lay their major emphasis on the increase in our farm tariff. In other words, there is no negotiation that can be carried through that will not be done at the sacrifice of the American farmer.', 'In speaking at Des Moines I gave some figures at which farm commodities could be sold in the United States from foreign countries, even in these days of distressing and even heartbreaking prices, if the tariff were reduced to a competitive basis for revenue. I can add some items that are especially applicable to the State of Illinois. Your soybean oil is an important new product with you. This oil now sells in the Atlantic coast markets for about $3.50 per 100 pounds. It could be imported for far less except for the tariff. It was formerly on the Democratic free list, and your entire industry would be destroyed by lowering the tariff to a competitive basis with the labor of China which is your chief competitive country. Your butter, which sells in New York at 22 cents, could be sold from New Zealand at this moment for 16 were it not for the tariff. And, as a matter of fact, your wheat, distressing as the price is, is selling in Minneapolis today at 12 cents above the Canadian price for similar grades.', 'In discussing the tariff at Des Moines I pointed out that at that moment there were about 2 million cattle in the northern States of Mexico seeking a market, and stated that: ""The price is about $2ð per 100 pounds on the south bank of the Rio Grande and $40 on the north bank, and only the tariff wall between them.""', 'This fact has greatly worried our Democratic orators, and they have concluded that these cattle must be bony, skinny, and seventh-class cattle. Although that is not true, I am quite prepared to transfer this comparison to the highest grade cattle in the world on the northern border where the difference is even more than the $2 margin between the north side and the south side of the Mexican border. I am further prepared to transfer this comparison to the Argentine, where the highest grade cattle that could come into New York in the form of meat for $7 per 100 pounds as against the present price of your meat at $12 per 100 pounds if it were not for the tariff. And I may say to the workmen of Illinois that it is because of the prices that you receive that men are employed in New York making goods for your consumption.', 'And I wish to call your attention to a further factor that has come to a head during the last few weeks, more particularly since I spoke at Des Moines, and that is the effect of the depreciation of foreign currencies on the ability of our competitors in agricultural products to ship into our markets. When their currencies depreciated, their prices and wages automatically decreased in comparison with ours, and this enables them to penetrate our tariff wall. At this moment foreign farm products, such as butter, pork products, grass for rugs, cattle, and competitive oils, have begun to flow over our borders in competition with our American farmers, and have contributed to the depreciation of the present prices. Particularly is this so from Canada, New Zealand, and the Orient, and from certain European countries. Fortunately, the Republican Party had secured, 2 years ago, the establishment of authority in the Tariff Commission by which the tariffs could we reexamined and readjusted in just such events. I have lately given instructions to the Commission to reexamine certain of the agricultural tariffs with view of presenting to me the actual facts of the difference in cost of production at home and abroad, and certainly if the facts are developed as they appear, I shall promptly act in relief of the American farmer. One of the planks of the Democratic platform, one of the things that has been consistently backed by the Democratic candidate, and one of the things passed by the Democratic Congress was to destroy this authority. And I ask you what emergency relief you could therefore expect from them.', 'The second point which I took up at Des Moines was the activities of the Farm Board. I stated that the original fundamental purpose of the Board was to encourage cooperative marketing. That they have done to a remarkable degree. Hundreds of cooperative associations would have gone bankrupt in this depression except for the ability of the Farm Board to lend to them the necessary money to carry them during the time of the depression. Today over 2 million of farm families throughout the United States, members of cooperatives, are receiving benefits solely because of the consummation of this undertaking by the Republican Party. Nowhere can I find that the Democratic candidate has agreed to continue this support of cooperative marketing through the Farm Board.', 'The Democratic candidate does denounce the emergency purchases of farm products during the panic. The files of the Farm Board will show the insistent demand of farm organizations, both Democratic and Republican Senators and Congressmen, Governors, bankers, and grain merchants for that emergency action to be taken. Some of the gentlemen who made these demands are the loudest critics of the Farm Board in this campaign. I have stated that as valuable as the operation was, I am convinced, and I believe the farmers are convinced, that its aftermath warrants the revision of the act to eliminate this section.', 'The third subject on which I spoke at Des Moines was the problem of better land use. The Republican platform contains a plank which constitutes the first declaration upon this subject. The Democratic candidate is now for it, but in a recent letter from him to Mr. Shearon, in New York, 1 freely circulated as a campaign document amongst the unemployed in the United States, he promises to put every one of the 10 million unemployed in the United States to work for the Government--a thing impossible to do without ruining every farmer in the United States with taxes and other disabilities. But he also enumerates the further reclamation of land amongst the projects of which he proposes to avail himself. The inevitable consequence would be to further expand agricultural production in the United States, and thereby further embarrass the American farmers with increasing surpluses and decreasing prices.', '1 See Item 347, page 588.', 'The fourth subject I discussed at Des Moines was waterways, on which the Democratic candidate has carefully refrained from any but vague references.', 'The fifth point which I discussed in that address was the loans made to help farmers during the drought and to rehabilitate their production where there were no credit facilities. I stated that I had seen to it that they would not be unduly pressed in the present situation for the repayment of these amounts, and I can report now that measures have been set up which have received the approval of these distressed people. The Democratic candidate has not expressed himself on the continuation of that policy.', 'The sixth matter which I discussed was the question of taxes upon land property and the injustice of the proportionate burden which the farmer is now bearing. The Democratic candidate has referred to this subject on a number of occasions. He offered to use his influence in solution of it. I stated at Des Moines that I proposed to call a conference of the tax officials immediately after the election and to review the whole relation of our taxes between the Federal, State, and local governments, and to find a basis for each that would give an opportunity to the States to give relief to the farmer.', 'The seventh point which I discussed at Des Moines was the necessity of maintaining a flow of short-term credit to the farmer to enable him to make short-term loans for planting, harvesting, and feeding of livestock and other productive necessities. I pointed out that much was being accomplished indirectly through credit expansion in various directions by the Government agencies, and I am now able to report that the 10 new agricultural credit institutions which can command over $300 million of credit are actually in operation in all parts of the country, and the sound demand of no farmer need go unsatisfied. There has been no expression from my opponent as to his views upon that question.', 'The eighth subject which I discussed was the authorization to the Reconstruction Corporation to make credit available for the movement of farm commodities to the market in normal fashion, and to make credits available for the sale of farm products to countries abroad not otherwise able to produce such commodities. Since that date the farmers of the Northwest States have asked for a loan with which to sell 15 million bushels of wheat to China, and I believe that, despite technical difficulties which have been raised before the Reconstruction Corporation, we shall find solution and secure relief to those farmers with consequent aid to the whole wheat situation. That is a practical application of what I stated at Des Moines as among the powers we had established for the Reconstruction Corporation. The Democratic candidate has not expressed himself upon this policy.', 'The ninth subject I discussed at Des Moines was the mortgage situation and the actions which we have already taken in provision of additional capital to the Federal land banks and the steps we have taken to secure coordination of private agencies to relax pressure upon mortgages. I further stated that I would propose to Congress at the next session a further reorganization of the Federal land banks to give them the resources and liberty of action to expand in the positive refinancing of the farm mortgages where it is necessary in order to give men who want a chance to fight for their homes the opportunity to do it. Since then we have further coordinated private loaning agencies and have thereby greatly relaxed the pressures from these agencies upon the farmers. The Democratic candidate in an indefinite way, has expressed his agreement to my proposal to further expand the land banks, but he has made proposals affecting private mortgages which, if he is to carry them beyond voluntary action already in course, he will require an amendment to the Constitution and will be required to adopt my proposal of reorganized land banks in full in order to do the job.', 'The tenth subject which I discussed at Des Moines was the important element of world stability in the recovery and expansion of our agricultural markets. I stated the necessity of the rebuilding of the credit structure of foreign countries, broken down by the present situation which had forced them off the gold standard and compelled them to restrict their imports of commodities; that we were participating in building up the World Economic Conference for the accomplishment of this purpose. I stated that I would send a representative of agriculture as a member of the American delegation to that Conference. We have made steady progress in the preparatory work for that Conference, and it will be held later in the year. The Democratic candidate has not expressed himself in support of that proposal.', 'The eleventh subject I discussed at Des Moines was the use of the war debts to assist in the expansion of agricultural markets; I commented on the proposal of the Democratic candidate to lower our tariffs in order that by profits gained from the flood of goods into the United States, these debts would be more easily paid by the foreigner, but the result would be to place the burden of these debts upon our workers by putting them out of employment and on our farmers by forcing their products to rot on their farms. There has been no withdrawal of this proposal by the Democratic candidate.', ""I stated that I was prepared to recommend that any annual payment of foreign debts be used for the specific purpose of securing expansion of American farm markets, which is the reversal of our opponent's proposal. The restoration of our proportion of European markets before Russia and other countries began their displacements would alone increase the market for our wheat by 50 million bushels and vastly increase our pork product exports. This will be made a real action."", 'The twelfth subject I discussed at Des Moines was the advancement of agricultural prices. I stated that the first measure of relief was to hold to our protective tariffs on farm products; that we will maintain. The next move in the battle for improved prices was to stop general deflation. There are evidences in nearly every direction that that has been stopped and that values are recovering. The third step is to expand the foreign market. The project I have proposed will work in that direction. The next step is to expand our domestic markets by restoration of employment, for 92 percent of American farm products are sold in America to American consumers. Every man taken from the ranks of the unemployed and put back to his job is, with his family, an increased consumer. This increase takes place by his ability to buy the more refined products of agriculture, such as animal products, which in turn require a larger consumption of grain. And I can report to you on authority of two different Government agencies that, since the adjournment of the Democratic House of Representatives, the measures which we have instituted for recovery of the country have resulted in a million men being restored to their jobs. They have begun to return at the rate of 500,000 a month, and it will soon begin to reflect in your markets.', 'I have the most earnest desire to rebuild agriculture. The country fully realizes that the purchasing power of the farmer must be restored to gain national prosperity. I frankly stated at Des Moines that I had come to the farmers with no economic patent medicine especially compounded for them, and that I refused to offer counterfeit currency or false ideas. I shall continue to search for further practical measures.', 'The Democratic candidate has developed one of the greatest mysteries of this whole campaign in his proposal for relief to agriculture. He has not been willing to state the method by which he proposes to secure the advance of agricultural prices. He has stated with great care six methods by which he can escape from any demand that he make good on his mysterious proposal.', 'And he could add two other doors of escape not mentioned--first, that any plan should be constitutional; and, second, that it should not violate the laws of practically every country in the world against the import of commodities produced as the result of subsidies. I closed the door to the New Zealand butter under our own law in order to protect the farmers of the United States on one occasion during this present depression because they were subsidizing production.', 'It seems to me cruel to hold out hope to a suffering people by vague plans, the most specific parts of which are the ways of escape from putting it into action. The only thing we really know of the plan is that he is unwilling during all these many weeks to submit it to debate. Now, I leave these questions of definite problems before you.', 'I would like to give to you an important analogy with the whole situation we are in.', 'It was from Springfield, in the heart of the western prairies, that Lincoln was called to the leadership of the Nation at the beginning of a crisis that threatened our destruction. It was an unprecedented situation of unprecedented problems. A multitude of conflicting counsels beat in on Washington. An influential body of public opinion advocated a do-nothing policy. Even the commander in chief of the national armies, on the day before Lincoln\'s inauguration, wrote in this spirit: ""Say to the seceded States,"" he wrote, ""wayward sisters, depart in peace."" The most distinguished statesman of the time, William H. Seward, Lincoln\'s Secretary of State, advised the President to take the country into a foreign war, in the hope that this might rally the separating States to the defense of the Union. As the long conflict wore on, discouraged patriots urged and urged again a negotiated settlement.', 'Through all this tumult of discordant opinions, under the terrible strain of discouragement and apparent failure, Lincoln kept his head. He thought straight: ""The Union must be preserved."" He never was diverted from his goal. He never faltered. And in the end the policies he had adopted, the forces he had set in motion, carried the country through. The Union was saved. His record, his example, are a priceless heritage to the Nation. They are a constant incentive to every man who occupies a position of leadership in difficult times. They are a living guide to every man who in the Presidential office lives hourly in his invisible presence.', 'We are assembled here today in the midst of a gigantic economic conflict. For the last 3 years we have been beset with forces that threatened our economic structure as truly as the forces unleashed in the War Between the States threatened the structure of the Republic. On other occasions I have compared our present situation to a war on a hundred fronts. I have given some account of these various engagements, and of the general strategy of our campaign.', 'Here at Springfield, with its historic associations, it is appropriate to review briefly the events of that earlier struggle and to consider some of the similarities to the situation that we have met in the last 3 years. We must not press analogies too far. But I believe you will agree with me as we examine the record that certain phases of the conflict between the States will help to better understand our recent events.', 'And first I would call your attention to the suddenness and unexpectedness with which the blow fell that transformed a peaceful people into a people engaged in a desperate war. As we look back now, it seems perfectly clear that the struggle had been in the making for many years. In the light of history, it seems to have been an inevitable conflict between two irreconcilable theories of government. But even as the day of armed conflict approached, the people were busy with the matters of everyday life. If you search the newspaper and magazine files of the time, you will be amazed at the tranquillity shown, in view of what we now know was then impending.', 'As you all remember, the storm broke in the weeks immediately before Lincoln\'s inauguration. The events that followed I need sketch only in the broadest outlines. The first 2 years were a period of almost unrelieved gloom for the Union forces. One disaster followed another and the year 1862 ended with Burnside\'s defeat at Fredericksburg. The year 1863 opened as gloomily with the disaster to Hooker at Chancellorsville. But in July of 1863 the Union retreat was definitely stopped by Meade at Gettysburg and Grant at Vicksburg- Still, the victory was far from won. The draft riots in New York that summer showed how even the North was feeling the strain. The gigantic struggle continued into the 4th year with no decisive outcome in sight. Grant, intrusted with the chief command of the Union forces in March 1864, entered upon the frightful ""wilderness campaign,"" which culminated in the appalling losses at Cold Harbor, June 1 to 3.', 'The Presidential campaign was coming on. A convention of the disaffected met at Cleveland on May 31 and nominated General John C. Fremont for President. The Republican convention met at Baltimore June 7--only 4 days after Cold Harbor.', 'We know now, what could not be known at the time, that the real victory had been won at Gettysburg; that the forces against the Union, gallant as they were, and actuated by the deepest of convictions, had been overcome in the long struggle of the preceding years. Yet this fundamental fact was still obscured by the smoke of battle. The North was still dismayed, almost stunned by the violence of the blows it had received. The casualties of the ""wilderness"" hung like a pall over the land. Would it be possible, men asked, for the Nation to survive ? Was it worthwhile fighting on ?', 'Lincoln was renominated by the Republican Party, but the country was profoundly disheartened. It felt it had made enormous sacrifices and had made them vainly. True, Grant had now advanced on Richmond and had invested the capital of the Confederacy. But early in July, the dashing Jubal Early had appeared in front of Washington, and it looked for a tense moment as if the National Capital itself might fall. A few days later a Federal attempt to break through the defense of Richmond failed disastrously.', 'Bear in mind what I said a moment ago, that the retreat of the Union had been for months definitely stopped and that the advance was already in progress. But the strain had been so long and so heavy that the Nation could not realize what had happened. The wave of discouragement that swept over the country in the summer of 1864 was so extreme that on August 23, Lincoln prepared his famous secret memorandum: ""This morning,"" he wrote, ""as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this administration will not be reelected. Then it will be my duty to so cooperate with the President. elect as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration, as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterwards.""', 'Six days later the Democratic National Convention met at Chicago and declared in its platform ""as the sense of the American people, that after 4 years of failure to restore the Union by the experiment of war . . . justice, humanity, liberty, and the public welfare demand that immediate efforts be made for a cessation of hostilities."" On that platform, with its appeal to discouragement, discontent, and suffering, the Democratic Convention nominated General George B. McClellan of New York for President.', 'But events marched rapidly. The grand strategy of the general advance, for which the foundation had been laid in the previous 12 months, began to bear fruit. After the gloomy summer of 1864 success attended the Union arms on every front. Sherman captured Atlanta on September 2 and began his march to the sea. Sheridan routed Early at Cedar Creek in October. The President was reelected in November. Thomas destroyed Hood at Nashville in December, and the following April came Appomattox Court House and the end of the war.', 'The transformation from apparent stalemate to overwhelming victory may have seemed amazing to many people at that time. But if it seemed amazing, it was only because people did not understand how well the foundation had been laid in the dark days that preceded and how effectively the strategy had been planned.', 'I believe this brief outline of the progress of events in a crisis that confronted a previous generation may help us to a juster appreciation of what has happened in the years just past and what is happening today.', 'In 1860, as in 1929, the country was unexpectedly faced with a great calamity. Then, as now, the disruptive forces gathered strength and for a time their progress seemed irresistible. Then, as now, the resources of the Nation were mobilized and organized in a campaign that finally ended the initial retreat. Then, as now, advances began here and there, so coordinated as to lead to the final triumph. But then, as now, the Nation had undergone such a strain, it was reeling under so many blows that even after the advance had begun many failed to realize what had happened.', 'Today our opponents are declaring in their platform, in words strangely reminiscent of those used by their predecessors in Chicago 68 years ago, that the struggle of this administration against the depression has been a failure and that ""the only hope of improving present conditions""--I quote from the present Democratic platform-""lies in a drastic change in economic governmental policies."" So in 1864 the Democrats declared that ""after 4 years of failure to restore the Union by the experiment of war""--again I am quoting from their platform--""that immediate efforts be made for a cessation of hostilities."" So again today, as in 1864, in the midst of a great war, they call for a change of leadership and of policies at Washington.', 'In spite of the hardships, privations, and other difficulties of the time, the Nation in 1864 refused to be swerved from a course that had turned the retreat into an advance. It supported the policies whose value had been tested under the fiery strain of the struggle. By its election mandate it directed those to whom it had intrusted leadership to go forward with the campaign strategy whose results already were in evidence. It declined emphatically to turn aside to untried policies and experimental leadership.', 'The same alternatives are before the country today that lay before it in that momentous campaign of nearly three-quarters of a century ago. The choice that the American people made in 1864 was made on November 8. The choice they are called to make in 1932 will be made on November 8 likewise. My fellow citizens, can we doubt what that choice will be ?', 'Men and women--and I include women because they bore then as they do now a large part of the burdens of that struggle--the support of that strategy and that leadership which preserved the Union came from the constancy of the Republican Party in its refusal to be diverted from the leadership which it had given at that time and the leadership which it has given in the last 4 years to the solution of a great national crisis.', 'The turn in the tide of the Civil War was made at Gettysburg. The turn in the tide in this crisis was made in the last winter, and just as after Gettysburg long months of continual battle were required to bring about the saving of the Union, in the same manner we must continue to fight today to recover our prosperity and to preserve the social and political principles for which Abraham Lincoln stood.']",0
4,Herbert Hoover ,"November 04, 1932","['My fellow citizens:', 'From the congressional elections in 1930 down to the present moment the strategy of the Democratic Party has been an effort to implant in the unthinking mind through deliberate misrepresentation the colossal falsehood that the Republican Party is responsible for this worldwide catastrophe. They appealed then to distress, hardship, and radicalism by nebular and inconsistent promises. These are the reasons they give why the Republicans of the country should desert their party, and why the Nation should abandon a constructive program with its accomplishment already demonstrated in overcoming this crisis. Theirs is not a campaign of issues; it is a campaign of avoidances. I propose tonight to discuss the nature of their campaign, its false premises, its vague promises, its shifts of position, and I shall also touch upon their destructive actions which have delayed recovery of this country for months.', 'Despite the fact that Democratic leaders announced after the congressional elections 2 years ago that they would have a real program to end this depression, they produced no program, then as now, although the crisis at one time rose to a degree which endangered the whole Republic. Instead of a constructive program, the Democratic leaders passed a number of bills through the Democratic House of Representatives designed to appeal to discontent and sectional cupidity and indeed of the type that would have destroyed the very foundations of our American system. Its threats to confidence set recovery backward. Their candidates have sought constantly to distort the facts as to the depression; they have sought to minimize the measures by which the administration saved the United States from a generation of chaos. They fail ever to mention the effect that these measures are having day by day in the steady recuperation of our economic life. Their leaders have taken no patriotic satisfaction in the fact that a million men have returned to work since the malign influence of the Democratic House and their allies was removed by adjournment of Congress, and the Republican measures and policies had an opportunity to act. No one of them has mentioned that men are returning to work at the rate of half a million a month.', 'The whole campaign has many aspects parallel with a campaign which took place in a former depression, of which I will read you a short description from a journal published in Washington during that time. That journal said more than half a century ago, and I quote:', '""The circumstances on which the Democratic Party base their hope of success in the present campaign is unquestionably the hardness of the times. Their expectation is that Republican voters will quit their party or at least remain at home on election day because they find themselves in straitened circumstances. Even the ravages of the grasshoppers, damages to the crops by drought in some sections and excessive moisture in others are to be traced by some mysterious process to the maladministration of the Republican Party.""', 'Later on that journal reviews the discussion of expenditures of the Republican administration during the period of depression and pointed out that the House of Representatives was Democratic at that time as it has been during the last year. It stated:', '""There had rarely been such ignorance joined with a stubbornness more mulish than that which characterized the action of some of the leaders of that body.""', 'And it continues:', '""Their economy was of the brilliant description which consists in saving at the spigot and losing at the bung.""', 'They likewise today repeat their promises of economy in the face of the attempts of the Democratic House last winter to fasten $3,400 million of added expenditures upon the Federal Government. The country wisely supported the Republican Party in that election of over a half a century ago, and it promptly made progress.', 'A circular placed in my hands since coming to this State, issued by the Democratic National Committee, says this depression was manmade. I agree with that, but they say the man who made it was myself personally. They express no gratitude that in my manufacture of this world crisis I have let this country off easier than Russia or Western Europe or South America.', 'In this campaign of 1932, also despite overwhelming proof to the contrary, but in order to make unceasing appeal to discontent, the present Democratic candidate and his corps of orators repeat down to the last 24 hours their unceasing statement that the Republicans made this depression and all that has happened in it.', 'Now, in the earlier part of this campaign the Democratic candidate held up the horrors of the Hawley-Smoot tariff act and of the stock market boom as being the sole causes of this world catastrophe. At Des Moines and at Detroit and Indianapolis I frequently established the complete absurdity of his tariff bill argument, and the Governor has since, at Wheeling, Baltimore, and Boston, uttered such confused thoughts in his tariff views that he can no longer consistently or conscientiously state that the tariff had anything to do with the worldwide catastrophe. If he would make his contradictory statements on the tariff consistent, it will have the disastrous political effect of requiring the deletion, so my statisticians tell me, of over 10,000 eloquent words from what has been said during this campaign. In order to continue the false premise on which the Democratic campaign continues to be based-that is, that the Republican Party brought on the depression--he is now thrust back, as his sole remaining explanation, to the boom of 1928. He argues now that if there had never been a boom there never would have been a slump, and if there never had been a slump in the United States, there would never have been a depression in the world.', 'Now, if by maintaining the prosperity of this country over a long period of years the people did become so overconfident of the future and thus overoptimistic, the Republican Party might be praised at least for that long period of prosperity. It was a bad outbreak of overoptimism and overconfidence. The collapse of the boom brought about great losses and great suffering, but I submit that some of the greatest leaders amongst the boom promoters of that period belonged to the Democratic Party, and the Democratic candidate himself assisted actually in promotions during that period which he now so warmly denounces. I do not criticize his acts. They were honest formations of concern. He was merely participating in the prevailing mood, like the former Democratic candidate who undertook the construction of the tallest building in the world in the same boomtown.', 'Of more importance, the Governor in his speeches conveys the impression that as President I should have stopped the boom. He does not describe the method by which I should have stopped it. Of course there is no constitutional nor statutory authority to Presidents to stop booms. If the President had attempted to stop that boom, one of the persons that he would have needed to warn is the present Democratic candidate.', 'Now, the only way I can see that a President could even tilt with a boom would be to turn himself personally into a blue sky law and go on the stump analyzing balance sheets and stock market prices and proving to the people that their investments were wrong. Now, I have little taste for this proposal that the White House should be turned into a stock tipster\'s office. I earnestly object to the idea that such a form of dictatorship should ever be set up over the American people, even if they do get overoptimistic. It may lead in directions for which this Republic would be mighty sorry. Even the Democratic platform does not seem to accord with the Governor, for it says: ""We condemn the actions of high public officials designed to influence stock market prices.""', 'Now, this same sort of reasoning led the Governor to propose in this city that the Presidential influence should be used in municipal finance. He said: ""If necessary they must be compelled to walk in the way of municipal honesty and efficiency,"" and he added: ""This is what I propose to do toward the credit represented by the 17 billions of municipal bonds."" It occurs to me that we should need to revise our whole form of government and the Constitution of the United States in a dozen places if the President of the United States is to supervise municipalities and mayors.', 'The Governor seems law to prevent booms to have some idea of creating a Federal blue sky and control the issue of all sorts of securities. I am not disputing that many securities are issued which are dishonest and over which there should be a control. But, the full constitutional authority for that sort of action rests, of course, in the States, and I am advised that this is not within the constitutional authority of the Federal Government. In any event, even if it were, I doubt whether the people in any State in the Union would like to have another board in Washington, distant from their own close inspection and understanding, dealing out certificates as to issue of securities and thus controlling the industries of their States. In any event, his plan would be centralization of government beyond anything we have hitherto witnessed and does not seem to accord with the forgotten Democratic theory of State rights. All this has been within the power of the State of New York not only to protect its own citizens but the citizens of other States, and the Governor seems to have forgotten it until this campaign.', 'Many years ago the Democratic Party undertook to remedy this whole question of booms and slumps by the creation of the Federal Reserve System. We have been afflicted with 15 of them in a century. They do bring disaster and hardship, and they ought to be remedied. But their new discovery was that, far from wanting the President to do this job, they should set up an agency and in it stipulate that the board alone should have powers entirely independent of the President, and they further made the board entirely bipartisan.', 'Now, it was indeed promised by Democratic leaders at the time the Federal Reserve System was created that they had found the solution to prevent booms, slumps, and panics. I could quote from a multitude of speeches of the day of the passage of the act, and further from: the assurance given in political campaigns as to this enormous accomplishment of their party.', 'I find in speeches of President Wilson, Secretary McAdoo, Senator Carter Glass, and other leaders, the recurrent idea that through the control of interest rates and other authorities the Federal Reserve System could prevent booms and consequently slumps and panics.', 'A few of their expressions ought to be of interest. Among them they said:', '""We shall have no more financial panics.""', '""Panics are impossible.""', '""Businessmen can now proceed in perfect confidence that they will no longer put their property in peril .""', '""Now the businessman may work out his destiny without living in terror of panic and hard times.""', '""Panics in the future are unthinkable.""', '""Never again can panic come to the American people.""', 'And I will not weary you with more quotations.', 'The whole country went along for years with much confidence in these statements and, although no one can say with certainty, it is likely that this confidence contributed to the building up of the boom which led to the crash.', 'The Governor will discover his errors in connection with the responsibilities for this boom if he will examine its relation to the Federal Reserve System. That System did loyally endeavor to restrain speculation. Many months before the collapse, it issued warnings to the banks about loaning money for speculative purposes, and it gave these warnings to the public. It placed restrictions on rediscounts, and they did force up the interest rate for speculative money to 15 and even to 20 percent. But that did not stop the mania for speculation. I do not criticize the Federal Reserve System. I believe in it. All the point I make is that using its utmost powers it failed in the face of a great mass movement-public psychology. Now the blame is to be transferred to the Republican Party for having failed to do the job which they promised would be done by the panacea of their own institution.', 'I could go further with this argument of futility by pointing out that the leading Democrats did not discover the Republican responsibility for this depression until it reached the vote-getting stage. Governor Smith, 2 years ago, implied that neither he nor any man takes the position of placing the responsibility for the business depression on either the President or the Republican Party. And Governor Roosevelt, before he was nominated, made a characteristically vague statement of much the same character.', 'The Democratic candidate, in a recent speech defending his boom argument, said that when our boom collapsed all but 20 percent of the people of the world were in a state of high prosperity. If he will examine carefully a statement of the National Bureau of Economic Research, whose authority no one denies, he will find that the booms of the following nations had already collapsed: Germany, Australia, Japan, Mexico, Turkey, Rumania, Bolivia, Brazil, India, Poland, and Bulgaria, embracing 600 million people, and that coincidently 11 other nations had been affected by the collapses I have mentioned--that is, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Hungary, Italy, Argentina, South Africa, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Peru, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Spain, had all declined. If he will check up the portion of the world included in these nations, he will find he has been misinformed about 300 percent.', 'As a matter of fact, if the Democratic candidate actually wants to make a point of the boom question and if he wants to put the true causes of this situation before the American people, he should with draw all this multitude of conflicting, confusing, and misleading statements and disclose to the American people that the most tremendous fact in modern history was the Great War and its aftermath. It would be only fair to point out that the difficulties we are now struggling with even within the United States consist to a large degree in the tremendous increase of our public debt, our foreign war debts, the liquidation of war inflation, the necessity to maintain a larger army and navy to protect ourselves in a greatly disturbed world. This war having come on during a Democratic administration, and they having spent the money, they should not have forgotten that the undertakings of that period are what create a multitude of the difficulties of this country today. If they would find the foundations of statesmanship, they ought to frankly recognize the problem with which the American people are faced. They should not be appealing to discontent on a basis of ignorance and of their full participation in the real causes. If they wish to find solutions for the guidance of the American people through these times, they should not continue to ignore these great burdens imposed upon the United States nor the effect on the world, ourselves included, by the enormous blotting out of lives in foreign nations by the World War, the fabulous waste of their property, the fabulous increase of their debts, the fabulous increase of armaments, the continued friction and hate that have arisen among them out of harsh treaties.', 'The Democratic candidate should not continue to ignore the panics which overtook these nations when their citizens recognized the fact that all property and material wealth must be readjusted in values from the consequences of the war. He should not overlook the frantic attempts of their governments to reduce the expenditures of their people by reducing the import of goods; the scramble of their citizens to turn what property they could into gold; the ultimate results in dictatorships and upsets in governments. He should not continue to ignore the effect of these things upon the United States and the dangers which so accumulated that we became the last fortress of world economic stability, and at one moment we held even that by the narrowest of margins. He should recognize the effect of the stoppage of the import of goods by these governments, not out of tariff reprisals to the Hawley Smoot bill, but out of their public necessity.', 'He should recognize the effect upon our credit system of the foreign withdrawal of $2,400 million in credit and gold from the United States in less than 14 months. He should recognize the fears which these events produced in our own citizens, causing them to draw out $1,600 million and put it into hoarding. And he should cease to ignore the fact that we were faced with a crisis of such dimensions that unless strong action had been taken in the passage of a bill for which Democratic Members of Congress voted, with the full knowledge of the facts, we could not have held the gold standard in the United States. And he should recognize that unless we had taken other strong and unprecedented measures we could not have prevented the collapse of our insurance companies, our banks, the foreclosures on millions of homes and farms, the strangulation of credit which would have brought about almost total unemployment.', 'It is true the Democratic Members voted for these measures of giving increased authority to the Federal Reserve System, of creating the Reconstruction Corporation, of support of mortgage banks. I admire their patriotism, and I have expressed it always. But if they did it without a knowledge of the facts of which they now appear to be so innocent, they are an easier group to persuade into legislation than I have hitherto met. They now fail to admit that these measures which we have put into motion have begun to bring about stability and prosperity in the United States, of which there is need of but one word more of proof. That is that since the adjournment of the Democratic House of Representatives and their allies last July down to this moment, over 1 million men have gone back to their normal jobs. They are going back at the rate of 500,000 a month unless they are interrupted by a change in these policies.', 'Now all of this statement that I have given to you has importance in four respects: first, because it proves the falsity of the foundation of their campaign; second, because it shows their utter confusion of mind, and either their insincerity or their utter lack of grasp of the forces loose in the world, and consequently the danger of placing men who have such a lack of penetration into the control of the Government of 120 million American people; third, because the continuous broadcasting of misinformation, although it is daily of conflicting character, as to where this calamity came from, indicates an irresponsibility which does not promise well for the Government of these same 120 million people; fourth, because they, as a responsible political party, should cease to appeal to unthinking people for votes based upon their suffering by misleading them as to its causes.', 'Having again disposed of the futile misrepresentations and evasions of the origins of this depression and the false basis of their appeal, I shall now consider some of their other evasions which have developed in the campaign. The Democratic candidate in his speech of acceptance says he will leave no doubt or ambiguity as to where he stands on any question of moment now before the country.', 'Notwithstanding this disarming promise, the people are still unable to find the method by which he will execute his six-point program for farm relief. It is one of the great mysteries of this campaign. It is a certainty that there will be six doors of exit from this attractive house, although he refuses to disclose the other specifications, and the walls have not yet been built.', ""The people have yet to learn what he proposes to do in respect to the soldiers' bonus. He seems to think that a cash sum of $2,300 million to be paid 13 years hence is no different from cash today, but he says that he intends it should be paid when there is a surplus in the Treasury with which to pay it. That means a surplus of $2,300 million. I assure the veterans of the World War that so long as there is a Democratic Congress there never will be a surplus of $2,300 million."", 'The people deserve to know more of his promise to take $1 billion off the expenditures of Federal Government, and before they can even start figuring on this question they must know whether he repudiates the Democratic proposals for $3 1/2 million additional expenditures which were passed by the House of Representatives in the last session of Congress. Does he repudiate the pork barrel and other expenditure bills ?', 'Now, the people deserve to know why, even at this late date, the Democratic candidate has not disavowed the bill passed by the Democratic House of Representatives to issue more than $2 billion of greenback currency, which bill, so far as Mr. Garner is concerned, remains upon the calendar as unfinished business of the Democratic House.', ""The people deserve to know why he has not yet stated his position on the proposal to put the Government into personal banking, as Provided in the bill passed by the last House of Representatives and in fact by the entire Congress under Mr. Garner's leadership, which I vetoed."", 'The people deserve to know his views on the rubber dollar provided for in the last session and passed by the last House of Representatives.', 'The people deserve to know what all his phrases and reservations about the Hawley-Smoot protective tariff really mean. He condemns it on every occasion. He gives 100 percent support to the competitive tariff for revenue. He gives nebular implications in such speeches as those at Wheeling, Baltimore, and Boston, that he will protect certain groups. Now the tariff is composed of different schedules. If he is sufficiently informed on the tariff law to debate its merits, he must be sufficiently informed to say at once which schedules are too high and which are too low. If he will do so, we will at once have them examined by the Tariff Commission as to the truth of his assertions, and we can afford quick remedy if his facts are correct. His only answer seems to be that he would do away with the Tariff Commission.', 'Now, the people deserve to know whether, as he has proposed to negotiate reciprocal tariffs, he will omit the agricultural commodities from these agreements.', 'The people deserve to know whether the Democratic State Committee of Oklahoma has the authority of the Democratic leaders for their promise to the people of that State to secure Federal legislation which will pour into that State $150 million for liquidation of long since repudiated Indian claims at the expense of the Federal taxpayer.', 'The American farmer deserves to know whether he is going to withdraw the Shearon letter 1--that is the proposal circulated amongst our unemployed to vastly expand reclamation land and thereby increase their surpluses despite the assurances given in another public statement that these surpluses must be reduced.', '1 See Item 347, page 588.', 'The people deserve to know whether he will support or repudiate Messrs. Wheeler, Norris, Huey Long, W. R. Hearst, and others, in their long-continued efforts to put the Government into large business undertakings.', 'The people deserve to know more details on the promise set out in the Shearon letter that the whole of the unemployed in the United States will be at once given jobs by the Government.', 'Are the people to assume that he does or does not endorse the system of national doles advocated in Congress by his present supporter, Senator La Follette of Wisconsin ?', 'The people deserve to know whether he has accepted the proposal of his supporter, William R. Hearst, for a $5 billion bond issue for nonproductive public works to be paid for out of the Public Treasury by the taxpayer.', 'They deserve to know if he joins with the same William Randolph Hearst in his opposition to the Disarmament Conference now in progress. Does he join with Mr. Hearst in his opposition to the promotion of peace by the Kellogg Pact?', 'The people ought to know if he still holds to his promise to solve the foreign debt problem by permitting foreign nations to sell goods in this country with which to pay sums owed our Government. In other words, are we, by giving up part of our market at the expense of our own workmen and our farmers, to furnish our debtors with profits necessary to make payments to us ?', 'He has been very emphatic on the provision of distress relief. That is also perfectly safe because the Government has provided for loans to the States in need of help to provide them with such relief.', 'Now, the evasions and misleading character of the campaign of the Democratic Party are not less evident in their program for dealing with the 18th amendment than in the other questions they have discussed. They know that their own Democratic strongholds in the South, if no other, will not accept the proposal for outright repeal of the 18th amendment, with the consequent return of the saloon, and its resultant lack of protection of the dry States.', 'I have stated in my acceptance speech what I believe is the only practical common ground with adequate protection on which this whole question can reach solution. That statement was the result of 3 years of intensive study and the responsibility of experience with the problem. It was delivered to probably the largest audience of the radio and press ever gathered together in the United States. It is known to you. It is a matter of public record.', 'Our Democratic opponents are trying to make another false issue over supposed coercion of voters by employers. In the first place, the ballot in the United States is secret, and no one can coerce a voter-except a political machine. In the second place, the interest of employer and employee is identical in securing business on which they mutually live. The Republican employer has the same right to publicly express his opinion on this election as has the Democratic employer and the Democratic orator.', 'Now, it is with sadness that I see attempts to mislead the people and avoid the real issues of the hour which demands a campaign of the most serious order.', 'I do not have the time tonight to present the whole great constructive measures of the administration by which we defended the American people from acute danger of a generation of chaos out of this world disaster. These measures are now placing us upon the road to recovery. They are vast and complicated. I think perhaps I can best illustrate the working of two of them--two out of scores--by short examples.', ""I would like to have you picture a group of gentlemen sitting in the board room of the Federal Reserve bank in one of our important cities 1,000 miles from Washington. Another similar group is seated in the board room of another Federal Reserve bank in a city some 200 miles from Washington. A group of advisers is seated with the President of the United States. Both of the city groups included Governors of the Federal Reserve banks, Directors of the Reconstruction Corporation, together with the leading bankers and merchants of those two cities, embracing men of both political parties. It was Sunday afternoon, and all had been summoned on a few moments' notice to meet a grave emergency. These three groups were continuously in communication by long distance telephone."", 'During the preceding week there had been a general run upon the banks in one of these important cities. Through Saturday evening and Sunday, panic increased and began to spread like a contagion to the whole district.', 'The banks were under heavy pressure because of the frightened depositors and the inability of the banks in the midst of the crisis to make a quick sale of their long-term securities without such tremendous sacrifice as to imperil all of their depositors or in turn to force the payment of notes of an army of borrowers without in turn forcing them to sell their homes and business at half price. It was found that one of the banks in one of these great cities had been weakened more than the others by these panic-stricken depositors. Without assistance, that bank would be unable to open on the following Monday morning. The failure of that bank to continue business would have added to the panic which threatened to bring down other banks in that city and spread in turn to other cities and involve many trust and insurance companies. The immediate problem was to provide before Monday morning a sufficient sum of money to quiet unreasoning fear and give absolute assurance that funds were available to pay every depositor in full without question.', 'In the course of inquiry upon the condition of the bank, it was found that they had ample securities which in normal times could have paid out their depositors with wide margins. But the securities could not be instantly sold at any price or at least at a price which would produce sufficient to pay all depositors, and they could not collect instantly from the note holders. In the inquiry into the condition of that bank, it developed they had 122,000 depositors, of whom 105,000 were savings depositors; that the average of the savings deposits was only $140 each; that many of them were workingmen and even children; that the safety of these depositors could not be separated from the other depositors of the bank.', 'It was found that there were 17,000 commercial depositors, most of whom were men and women engaged in small businesses, whose deposits represented the money necessary to meet their payrolls, the purchasing of their materials, and the discharge of obligations to others incurred in the course of their business. Jeopardy to them meant that many thousands of men and women in factories and stores would be discharged into untold hardship.', 'But these were not all of those that were dependent upon the maintenance of this bank. It was found that among the 17,000 commercial deposits 755 were country banks, the great majority of them in towns of less than 5,000 people. If this bank should fail, many of these country banks must also fall.', 'In the complex system of our economic life, things that on the surface seem unrelated are in fact under the surface inextricably tied together. A farmer in a small town in an agricultural State might feel no concern for the safety of this important bank in a great city. The widow with a small deposit in a small bank of a town of another State might know of no relationship between her bank and that city bank. But the farmer in one State and the widow in another, even though they did not know it, had a direct financial stake in the fate of that city bank. For the country banks must conduct business with the city banks in the ordinary course of trade, and they must carry their reserves with the city banks in order that they may draw interest upon them which they in turn pay to their depositors.', 'Now, it was found on examination that these 755 depositing banks had 60 million depositors scattered over 15 States, and that was not all. There were 21,000 other banks scattered through the country, which had deposits in the 755 banks depositing with this particular city bank, and in these 21,000 banks were over 20 million depositors, and they involved widows, orphans, workers, insurance companies, and merchants and manufacturers.', 'And in addition to all this, there was the position of the borrowers from all this mass of banks. If this city bank should fail, there must be immediate demand for the payment of the money due from its borrowers. If any of the banks dependent upon it should fail, their borrowers must in turn be compelled to make immediate payment of money due as it was due and to realize upon their property at a time when property could not be turned into cash at anything like its real value. Now, I will not tire you with these statistics, but they are important that our country should understand.', 'In this city bank and in the 755 banks which carried their reserve deposits in this city bank, there were 695,000 men and women and institutions owing money on their notes. They were scattered throughout the length and breadth of the land. They were on the farms, in the cities, the villages and hamlets. Most of all these groups of people were unaware of their danger. They were in their homes and in their churches, concerned with their own affairs, but they were not being forgotten.', 'The men who had conducted this bank over great numbers of years were men of high esteem in the whole community. To their credit be it said that their chief concern was the preservation of these hundreds of thousands or millions of people from disaster. They were asking nothing for themselves.', 'The investigations and the conversations occupied many hours of continuous communication from these two cities to Washington and back again. Remember this was a Sunday, when the normal processes of business were difficult to conduct. Countless difficulties were encountered and solutions worked out. They were working against time.', 'Finally, at 3 hours after Sunday midnight, that task was completed. The assets had been valued by the examiners of the Reconstruction Corporation. The banks of the two cities joined in lending assistance, and the Reconstruction Corporation agreed to furnish a sufficient sum to assure that this bank could open without fear and meet every demand of its depositors.', ""At 10 o'clock on Monday all these banks opened for business as usual. Public announcement was made that ample funds were on hand to pay every depositor. As had been anticipated, immediately excitement and panic subsided and confidence was restored. The crowds melted away, and the deposits began to return. The situation was saved, not only in this bank, but in all of the other banks which had been subject to heavy withdrawals."", 'The loans offered by the cooperating banks and the Reconstruction Corporation were never fully called for and have since been largely repaid, and they will all be repaid. Every danger in connection with that episode is now over.', 'The central human figure of that bank was a man, known to you in St. Louis, who had served his country for 40 years in many high capacities--both in peace and in war--who in recent years had been absent from the country in a position of first importance to the American people.', 'That is the story of the Dawes bank in Chicago.', 'You know the use our political opponents have made of this dent all through the Midwest. They ignore the fact that General Dawes resigned from the Reconstruction Corporation 3 weeks before, on his first news that attacks were being made on the bank with which his name had long been associated. He resigned to try to save that bank without a call on the Reconstruction Corporation of which he had been a Director. He knew and appreciated the use that would be made in this campaign of such a calumny. He sought to avoid it. And you should know that when that Sunday morning meeting started, General Dawes stated that he could not bring himself to ask for assistance from the Corporation in which he had so lately been a Director and thus involve the President of the United States in criticism. But it was upon the insistence of the Democratic members of the Reconstruction Board, sitting in the Federal Reserve bank meeting at Chicago, and upon the insistence of the leading Democratic banker of Chicago, who was then mentioned as a candidate for the Presidency of the United States, and upon the insistence in New York City of the leading Democratic banker and a leading Democratic manufacturer, also mentioned for the Presidency; upon insistence of the other Democratic members of the Reconstruction Corporation as well as the Republicans that this was no case of personal feelings for General Dawes or the effect upon the campaign or this administration; that this was solely a case of national necessity, and those men then and there joined and offered to take the full responsibility for that action.', 'These men acted not because they were Democrats or Republicans but because they were loyal citizens of the United States. That situation required broad vision and comprehensive understanding of the problem, instant decision, bold and courageous action, and a human heart. Only by this was a major disaster averted. And I may tell you that not only were these loans adequately secured, but in the ordinary course of business they are being largely paid off.', 'The constant misrepresentation of this episode for political purposes by Democratic politicians is a slander upon men of their own party as well as a cruel injustice to General Dawes. It is a characteristic example of the character of this campaign. It is an insult to the American people to substitute this sort of political agitation for competent discussion of the grave issues which lay today before our country.', 'And I may tell you that this is but one of six similar episodes in great financial centers in the United States, the direct result of the shocks and fears which we received from the collapse of Europe. But such action by our Government agencies has not been limited to great financial centers. In over 5,000 towns of populations under 25,000 the Reconstruction Corporation has had to intervene to save their banks under similar circumstances and thank God that day has gone by. At the height of this crisis they had to make loans to insurance companies with 15 million policyholders. They made loans to 736 building and loan associations with over 10 million members. They made loans to several hundred farm and home mortgage companies, agricultural credit associations, livestock credit corporations--all of them for the purpose of preventing the loss of hundreds of thousands of homes and farms and the destruction of family life. The totals today aggregate millions of men and women who were not forgotten.', 'I have gone into this matter at such length to illustrate to you by actual example what the operation of the Reconstruction Corporation has meant. This is an example of the meaning of my oft-repeated phrase about the use by the Federal Government of the full power of its credit in time of great national emergency for the protection of millions of families and firesides.', 'The Democratic candidate for President has since the beginning of the campaign been going up and down the country characterizing the Reconstruction Corporation and maintaining that its actions have been for the benefit of large corporations and not for the benefit of the ordinary citizen. Can he honestly believe that in the incident I have described to you and in the countless similar cases, the action was taken for the benefit of the bank and not for the depositors and borrowers? When these loans have been repaid, there has been no benefit to the banks. There has been the preservation of the lives of millions of people.', ""[At this point, the transcript taken from a sound recording of the President's address ends. The following text is taken from the President's reading copy.]"", 'If he does not so believe, then I say in all solemnity that his action in fostering a spirit of discontent in a political campaign by the use of erroneous information merits just condemnation.', 'One of his first utterances to this effect was immediately challenged by a prominent citizen of his own State, a former superintendent of banks, who addressed a letter to him setting forth the real facts and requesting a retraction. Weeks have now elapsed, and that request has been met only by silence upon the part of the candidate.', 'Now I wish to picture to you another episode in this supreme battle to protect the American people, the last fortress of stability in the world, but at the same time to extend a helping arm of assistance to another great nation.', 'In the latter part of May a year ago Ambassador Sackett made an emergency journey from Berlin to see me to present to me the desperate situation of the German people. His evidence showed that under the burden of unbearable debts and the cost of war, that great nation was rapidly disintegrating and the people desperately discouraged. They had made a courageous effort to meet these obligations, but their discharge was inexorably undermining their whole economic and social structure. In desperation, those who had fought manfully to comply with the obligations imposed upon them had lost all heart for the future and were steadily coming to the conclusion that nothing short of a revolution such as that which had taken place in Russia offered them any hope of deliverance.', ""Moved by the Ambassador's picture of what was happening to the common run of men and women in that country, I took up that problem, not alone from the interest of this great mass of humanity, but knowing that, if that nation should fall, the reactions upon the rest of the world and the United States would be irreparable. President von Hindenburg, knowing of Mr. Sackett's visit, sent me an appeal of a character between heads of nations without precedent in diplomatic history. That appeal was for preservation of a great people that I should use the good offices and prestige of the United States for their rescue."", 'In order to give a year in which the world, particularly European nations, could come to a comprehension of what this disintegration was doing to civilization itself, I proposed the postponement of all international debts for 1 year.', 'This was not easy to accomplish. The bitterness of war hates and nationalism, still rampant in Europe, made its acceptance doubtful. In order to make sure that it would be accepted in our country I interviewed the leaders of both Republican and Democratic parties, and upon display to them of what was transpiring, secured their approval in sufficient number to assure that we could complete the measure on our side. I then resolved upon a bold course. I published the proposal within 24 hours after communications to the other countries in order that politicians of the world might not thwart it through processes of diplomacy.', 'Immediately after this act, for the first time in the history of the world, I made personal, hourly use of the newly installed transatlantic telephone and talked with our ambassadors in the presence of the leaders of the nations. I received wholehearted and immediate response from Signor Mussolini of Italy; the same sympathetic response from the Prime Minister of Great Britain. Furthermore, the Governments of Belgium and Poland, which you might think would have retained more bitterness from the war than any other nations, responded instantly.', 'The arrangements were not easy, as existing contracts were complicated in their relationships between many nations, and they involved unequal sacrifices. Day after day, night after night, I was in communication with first one ambassador and then another, proposing methods to meet difficulties which arose, building up adjustments among different nations, until finally that year of postponement w-as secured.', 'And it was not merely a postponement of a year in the payments on debts for which I was seeking. I was seeking for a year in which Europe could solemnly consider the situation into which she was drifting. I was seeking to remove from the mind of the world the fears of debacle in civilization which were breaking down all security of credit, and to bring to their attention the healing powers of international cooperation.', 'You yourselves are familiar with the history of the year which followed. I know that the proposal of the moratorium diverted the entire current of thought and changed the history of what otherwise would have been a tragedy to the whole of civilization. It brought to new understanding the realization of the burdens under which Germany has been laboring.', 'Under the impulses of these agreements and the recognition at least of the peril in which they stood, there came out of this agreement a great measure of redemption to the German people, a sense of greater security to the world from the agreements at Lausanne.', 'That agreement and the human sympathies which were evoked by that new understanding of the postwar difficulties in the world have served greatly in the healing of the wounds of the Great War.', ""There lie in many events of the last 3 years great dramas, great tragedies. I have told of but two of them. But, overriding all these incidents, the world has witnessed the courage of men and the willingness to place their fate and their political future at stake for the world's progress. No man can go through these episodes without belief that there is a great regeneration in the courage, confidence, and intelligence of men for the guidance of this world back toward stability and common interest in the development of human welfare.""]",0

I used my voice pretty much last night, and I am going to have to use it again tonight. But I do want to express my appreciation to you for this greeting. It is generous. It indicates that you get up powerful early in the morning, but what is more, it indicates what you are likely to do on the 8th day of November, which is more important.', '[2.] ROCKFORD, ILLINOIS (Rear platform, 8:30a.m.)', ""You will realize that an occasion of this sort is not one on which one can go far into national issues. You will also realize that it is rather difficult on one's voice to be making public addresses at night and still talk outdoors in the daytime. Nevertheless, I would like to remind you of one national issue that is of vital importance to you, and that is that a long series of unprecedented steps and measures have been taken by this administration to protect this country from the catastrophe that swept over this country from Europe; that these measures have begun to show their vitality and their results; that since the adjournment of the Democratic House of Representatives they have had a fair chance and during these last 4 months clearly show the reemployment of nearly 1 million men, and they are going back at the rate of 500,000 a month. The reemployment of these men adds to the market for the farmer, and thereby we shall see the restoration of this economic machine of ours, provided that it is not interrupted on the 8th day of November."", 'There is one other issue that is of vital importance to Rockford, and that is the continued maintenance of the protective tariff. The tariff is being greatly undermined through the falling currencies of Europe. These currencies have fallen through the catastrophies which have come to those countries, with which the United States has had no relation. It has decreased their cost of living and their wages, which makes it more difficult for American manufacturers and workmen to maintain their standards of living and wages.', 'And our Democratic opponents, in the face of the actual decrease in currency that is going on today through these causes, now propose to further reduce the tariff. Already two or three plants in different parts of the country have closed down because of this competition. We have set up through the Tariff Commission a method of remedy. We are proceeding as rapidly as possible toward that remedy. Our opponents propose to destroy the Tariff Commission. In other words, they cannot use information in the West with regard to the tariff which differs from the information which they use in the East.', 'I thank you for your reception. It is encouraging, and I am deeply touched by it.', '[3.] BELVIDERE, ILLINOIS (Rear platform, 9:35 a.m.)', 'I always find it difficult to formulate the phrases that express the gratitude which I feel for these receptions.

You have in this city an interest in the maintenance of the protective tariff. Your manufactures here are all of them protected, and the jobs of the men in the factories here are protected through the tariff. We have not only to meet today the normal competition of the world with our manufactures, but we have to meet, as the result of the cataclysm which has come over Europe, the effect of their depreciated currencies. Those currencies have lowered wages, lowered standards of living, and have made competition with you more severe than ever before in your history.', 'Our Democratic friends, in the face of these added difficulties, say they will lower the tariff and destroy the protection which you now have. They wish a competitive tariff for revenue only, and they are asking you to undertake competition with the lower-paid labor of the world.', ""Not long ago I had a survey made as to the standards of living in different countries. We used as a common denominator the amount of bread and butter that could be purchased with a week's wages. We found that in Japan, which is now exporting to the United States large quantities of goods, that the Japanese workman could buy only one-eighth of the amount of bread and butter which you can buy with your present wage scale. That is the sort of competition which you are expected to meet in a competitive tariff for revenue only. Our party is not alone to maintain the protective tariff but to increase it wherever it may be necessary in order to maintain American workmen in their jobs."", 'You have many other things which interest you personally. Above all, the primary issue of this campaign is the measures which are to be continued for the recovery of the country from its unemployment and the distressing plight of its agriculture. The Republican administration has set up a long list of instrumentalities that are engaged in that purpose today, and they are succeeding since the adjournment of the Democratic House of Representatives. We have approximately 4 months to test out the efficacy of those measures, and during that time over 1 million men have been returned to their jobs. They are returning now at the rate of 500,000 a month. And it is in the restoration of employment that we shall secure the added markets and the added prices to our agriculture.', 'Now, I could go on and discuss national issues, but length of time does not permit. I do want to express to you my gratitude for your reception and the encouragement which you have given by your coming here this morning.', '[4.] BELOIT, WISCONSIN (Rear platform, 10:25 a.m.)', 'My friends:', 'This is a great welcome and a great greeting from the State of Wisconsin. I thank you for it. It is a sign of what Wisconsin will do on the 8th day of November.', 'Now, this is not an occasion on which one can discuss national issues at great length. I speak again in St. Paul tonight, and I hope that you may through the radio participate in that discussion.', 'I have long known of Beloit more through her college than through her larger activities. I live myself in a college town. For 40 years I have had association with their ideals and dreams, and I value them greatly, and I envy any citizen privileged to live in a community that has so much of a fermenting ( ? ) 1 influence as a great college.', '1 The question mark appears in the original transcript.', 'There are other matters of great interest to you in this campaign and in this forthcoming election. One of them is the protective tariff.', '[At this point the train pulled out oœ the station without allowing the President to finish his remarks.]', '[5.] MADISON, WISCONSIN ( University of Wisconsin Fieldhouse, 12 noon )', 'It is a great pleasure to come to a city which has made itself famous by the contribution of a great university to the thought and leadership in modern life. My own home for 40 years has been on the campus of another great university, and I have valued to the highest degree the constant refreshment that has come to me from the idealism and dreams of youth who come to these institutions to fit themselves for this leadership in national life. I know your minds are alive to the great problems of our times, and that you are conscious of the new forces that have entered into the world and into our national life.', 'It is not my purpose to discuss at length with you economic issues. I would rather discuss with you those fundamentals for which America stands. These fundamentals are being tested daily in this the greatest peacetime crisis that has come to our country. We have builded a nation on certain conceptions of equality and personal freedom that are unique in the whole world. As a people we have sought a system that would give opportunity and stimulate each individual to his intellectual uttermost, and by the accretion of the contributions to thus enrich national life and to produce progress and through the sum of them to produce a new intellectual standard for the world and the guarantee of a national progress that will be worth all we have poured into it. We have created political equalities. We have created equality for men at birth, equality of men before the law, and we have set the ideal of an equal opportunity for all men and women. However much it may have fallen short of the ideal, it is yet infinitely more advanced than that held up before men in any other nation in the world. By these social conceptions, by the form of government, there have been created and given to our people the opportunity of expression that has set new standards, created a unique society in the world.', 'A fundamental part of this equality of opportunity and the part in which the United States is unique and envied of all people is our system of universal free education, by which the child of the humblest farm may learn from the alphabet to the Einstein theory--all that the mind of man has accumulated down the ages for his instruction and equipment to meet the battle of life. So zealous have we been to maintain this fundamental of an equal opportunity of men, and the sum of these accomplishments which produce the progress of the Nation, that it is not remarkable that, in the fullness of the freedom which we have protected, there has periodically appeared in our history its transformation into license, especially in the economic field and field of crime, which must be vigilantly restrained. Our fundamental purpose is the development of moral and spiritual growth and the strengthening of national ideals and national character. But in the restraints we have had to be constantly on guard that we do not stifle the intellectual opportunities and the initiative of men, for out of these flows the new strength upon which the Nation constantly feeds. We are, therefore, constantly confronted with the degree to which these restraints can be set up and still preserve that vital initiative and intellectual freedom which have elements of self-control which belong alone to self-government. On the other side we have to constantly guard lest in our restraints we regiment men instead of creating free men.', 'One of the very pertinent questions which arise out of this liberal license to men is the violation of law. Lawlessness and crime have unquestionably grown in our country. Some ascribe it to the too great license of individual liberty; some to the breaking down of moral restraints due to the Great War; and some to prohibition and a hundred other causes. Some have urged that we must change the whole basis of our Federal system, and that we should place the burden of this restraint upon the Federal Government because of the failure of some States and some municipalities to give proper function to their own responsibilities. Yet this would be a destruction of State sovereignty and local responsibility, the destruction of individual responsibility, and make a nation of vassals through bureaucracy concentrated at a far distant point.', 'The responsibility for the control of crime rests emphatically upon the States and the local communities. Our civilization will rise no higher than the concepts of order that reside in the self-control of an educated people. I think you are all conscious of the humiliation that comes to our countrymen when the Federal Government must deliberately use the violation of income ,tax laws to collect gains on crime in order to curb these criminals who are uncontrolled, unprosecuted, and unconvicted by the States and municipalities.', 'I can discuss this subject with more heart in the State of Wisconsin than any other State in the Union, because you have recognized your responsibilities, and you have sought to preserve your people from the forms of crime which in other places dictate the very conduct of communities, and indicate a clear sense of responsibility and vigilance in your people.', 'The gangster life which has developed in some of our cities and some of our States is one of the most dangerous elements to the whole of our civilization. It would seem that with the opportunities that were given the Governor of New York, who is a candidate for the Presidency of the United States, he might have made a larger contribution in these last 3 years to the solution of the gang life in that State, under the great powers conferred and the obligations bestowed by the constitution and laws of his own State.', 'Now, for a moment on economic issues.', 'The workers in the great industries of Wisconsin, both agricultural and industrial, are peculiarly dependent for their standards of living as never before upon the maintenance of the protective tariff. Dependent also is the fate of the small businessman upon the prosperity which must be thus protected. In the agricultural field I need only to refer to your great dairy industry where you lead the entire Union. Today its products, distressingly low as their prices are, would be 20 to 30 percent lower if it were not for the tariff wall which surrounds them. The consequence of the collapse of 30 foreign governments and the consequent depreciation of their currency, which means also the lowering of their wages and standards of living, are constantly endeavoring to make breaches in our tariff walls which [have] retard[ed] the recuperation in agriculture during the whole of these last 6 or 8 months. This has indeed grown to such a point of seriousness that you have need to consider, not the reduction of these tariffs which our Democratic opponents propose, but the strengthening of this wall of protection. Fortunately we have been able to thwart our opponents in their endeavor to destroy the independent authority of the Tariff Commission with its flexible potencies. We now have before that Commission a reconsideration of the necessities of this primary industry in your State.', 'Nor are your manufacturing industries less dependent upon it than your agricultural industries. Without the protective tariff, with the lowering of the tariffs which our opponents propose, you must be faced with an increasing unemployment instead of the steady march of recovery and of employment which are evident on every hand. We have passed, in the last 3 years, through the greatest crisis in our peacetime history. We have witnessed the economic crash of two-thirds of the world, and its repercussions have moved in upon our people in a manner which has at times endangered even our national stability. We have been the last fortress of strength in a crashing world. By the unprecedented measures, which we have taken we have prevented a chaos which might have extended over generations.', 'This battle of defense has now through these measures been turned into a great offensive for recovery. There was little opportunity for it to make itself felt in recovery until after the adjournment of Congress, with their constant destruction of confidence and spreading of fears from measures which were being presented to the American people and passed by a Democratic House of Representatives. But in these 4 months since that time we have seen the return of 1 million men to work, and the records show that they are returning today at a rate of nearly half a million a month. Materially it is of the greatest importance to you and every American citizen that this great battle which is in progress on the whole economic front shall not be interrupted by the long delays which are proposed to you in order that there shall be a change in policies and strategies.', 'I have endeavored in the last month in the presentation of these and many other issues to appeal to the thoughtful people of the United States, and I accept your demonstration as evidence of the support which you are giving to me out of your conviction in this battle. I have made no endeavor to appeal to emotion, but I have made an endeavor to appeal to reason. I have fixed my faith upon the logical conclusions of a thoughtful people.', '[6.] BARABOO, WISCONSIN (Rear platform, 1:45 p.m.)', 'My friends:', 'My chief recollection of this town comes from the fact that for many years it was the hometown of the Ringling Circus which I attended with great industry during my early life.', 'I wish to thank you for your greeting. It is heartening. It is encouraging to continue a fight for the fundamentals that have built up this Nation. It is encouraging to keep on with that fight until the last moment. And it is an evidence of your desire to see that the Republican Party is returned on the 8th day of November.', 'Many of you have radio sets. Many of you will be able to listen in this evening, and I hope to have something more to say about the problems that are before us and perhaps something to say about our opponents.', '[7.] ELROY, WISCONSIN (Rear platform, 2:40 p.m.)', 'My friends:', ""We haven't long to stop on this occasion. It is not much of an opportunity to discuss national issues. I shall be on the radio again tonight from St. Paul. Most of you have the opportunity to listen in and join in that discussion."", 'I do appreciate your coming down and giving me this greeting. It is very encouraging. It is helpful to carry on this fight. It is a sign of what you will do on the 8th day of November, and I thank you for it.', '[8.] MERRILLAN, WISCONSIN (Rear platform, 4:25 p.m.)', 'My friends:', 'I do wish to express my appreciation for this greeting. It is a great encouragement in making a fight to find the people ready to come down and give you such a generous welcome as this, and it is also to me an indication of where your heart is going to lie on the 8th day of November.', 'Now, a stop like this is too short a time to discuss national issues. I am going to speak from St. Paul tonight, provided I can get the speech written in time. You will then have an opportunity to hear not only what this administration has been doing but something about what I think of our opponents.', 'I wish to thank you for this reception because it is a great encouragement.', '[9.] EAU CLAIRE, WISCONSIN (Rear platform, 5:40 p.m.)', 'My friends:', 'It is very difficult for one to formulate phrases of the eloquent order that so generous and so cordial a reception as this would warrant in response. It is encouraging. It is inspiring, and it is stimulating in a great battle to know that there are so many devoted supporters to that cause. And it is a promise of what the action of Wisconsin will be on the 8th day of November.', 'This is not an occasion on which to discuss national issues. It is an occasion on which you may take a look at me, and it is an occasion in which I may have the great pleasure of meeting with you. Within a few hours I shall be speaking from St. Paul and from there try to traverse some more of our national problems and to express my opinions to you on some questions raised by the opposition party.', 'I cannot hope on this occasion to make a long address or a prolonged address. It is necessary, and I think you will be helpful to me, that I save my voice for the strains which it must encounter during the next 2 or 3 hours. But I do wish to express my appreciation for this manifestation of real friendship, and I thank you for it.', '[10.] HUDSON, WISCONSIN (Rear platform, 7:10 p.m.)', 'My friends:', 'I want to express the appreciation I have for so tremendous a reception as this. It is heartening. It is a fine expression of your confidence. It is stimulating to continue this fight to the end. And it is an evidence of the action which you will take on the 8th day of November.', 'This is not a time to enter upon a discussion of national issues. Within a couple of hours, I shall be speaking over the radio from St. Paul, and there I will undertake to expound some of the views of the administration, some of our problems of the past, and hopes for the future. I probably will also make some comments on our opponents.', 'It is indeed difficult for me to express that gratitude I have for your coming to see me and for this reception. I thank you.']",0
6,Herbert Hoover ,"November 05, 1932","[""In these closing hours of the campaign I am conscious that the American people are summing up in their minds the candidates' statements, the issues, weighing the expositions of party policy, making their appraisals of party measures and of men, and thus preparing themselves individually for their final personal decision to be expressed by their ballots at the polls next Tuesday."", 'I stated a few days ago that the most important issue before the American people at this moment is to overcome this crisis. What our people need is the restoration of their normal jobs and the recovery of agricultural prices and of business. They need help in the meantime to tide them over their difficulties in order that they may not suffer privation or lose their farms and homes.', 'There are other measures which concern the more distant future. We must not lose sight of them. But the great balance in which to weigh the two great political parties today is in their attitude toward this immediate problem, because in this attitude lies their philosophy of government, their ability to penetrate into causes, their capacity to meet emergency and to translate measures into action. And in these balances should also be weighed the question of honesty in presentation to the people of the facts so that they may formulate a proper judgment.', 'There is beyond this the common, everyday fact as to whether the present administration measures and policies now in action are accomplishing the purposes for which they were set out and therefore deserve ratification and retention by the people. There is also revealed in this accomplishment what we may hope for in the way of performance for the future.', 'Many of our hopes for the long-view development of our Nation have been interrupted by the necessity to devote our concentrated attention to the protection of the American people from the cataclysm which has swept over the world as the result of the aftermath of the World War.', 'Our opponents have endeavored to build a fantastic fiction as to the causes of these events in the last 3 years in order that they might blame the Republican Party for all the distress and disasters which have happened, not only in our country but in the rest of the world, and thus resort to the oldest trick of politics by stimulating a protest vote. That is playing politics with human misery, but in the pursuit of this misrepresentation they have demonstrated a total lack of understanding of the real situation with which the Government must deal if we are ever to find our way out of this depression. This narrowness of vision, this incapacity to reach to the heart of things, is a complete demonstration of their unfitness for the still gigantic task of leading the Nation back to normal life and the resumption of its forward march of progress. They have deliberately avoided and decried the accumulation of strains which grew out of the Great War; they even ignore that such a war took place. They ignore the piling up of our national debt and the debts among combatant nations greater than the whole wealth of the United States.', 'They ignore the loss of the productive skill and intelligence of millions in Europe, blotted out by battle, disease, and starvation. They ignore the poison springs of political instability which lay in the treaties that closed the war, the fears and hates that have held armaments to double those before that time. They ignore the new nationalism of a score of small nations sprung from the war with all their own tariff walls and disturbances to old channels of trade. They ignore the ruinous government policies which fallaciously sought to build back to prosperity the impoverished countries of Europe by enlarged borrowing, by subsidizing industry and employment with taxes that sapped the savings upon which industry must be rejuvenated and commerce solidly built. Under these strains the financial systems of many foreign countries crashed one after another.', 'These blows struck at us through decreased world consumption of goods.', 'If we look back over the distress of these years we find that three-quarters of the population of the globe has suffered from the flames of revolution; many nations were subject to constant change and vacillation; others resorted to dictatorships and tyranny in desperate attempts to maintain some sort of social order. I ask you to compare that with the condition of the United States.', 'We are part of a world, the disturbance of whose remotest population affects our own financial system, our markets, our employment, and the prices of our farm products. And we have many problems of our own growing out of the Great War--the inflation of values during the war and the stupendous increase of our debt, the failure of foreign countries to respond to their debt obligations to us. Finally, with the desperate crisis abroad, the whole world scrambled to convert their property into gold and thus withdrew from us suddenly over $2,400 million of exchange and gold. These fears spreading to our own citizens caused them to withdraw $1,600 million in currency from circulation. The effect of this was to withdraw vast sums of gold from our own use, as we must protect the gold convertibility of our currency, with further repercussions of credit stringency, unemployment, and dropping prices. Yet we have protected our dollar and made it ring true on every counter in the world.', 'Our own economists overlooked one great fundamental factor--that while our own people consume 90 percent of their production, yet no one calculated the effect of worldwide fear upon our credit system and on the confidence of the Nation which thereby suddenly undermined our industry and commerce.', ""In the face of these gigantic, appalling worldwide forces our opponents set up the Hawley-Smoot tariff bill--changing as it did the tariffs on less than one-sixth of our own imports, one one-hundredth of the world's imports, and introduced long after the collapse started-as the cause of all this world catastrophe. What an unspeakable travesty upon reason this explanation is!"", 'Suppose that we had never had the Hawley-Smoot tariff bill. Do you think for one moment that this crushing collapse in the structure of the world, these revolutions, these perils to civilization would not have happened and would not have reached into the United States ?', 'And yet, in order to make a political campaign by which they can play upon discontent so that they could hope to create a protest vote, they are compelled to set up this travesty of argument. By this class appeal to the negative impulses of men they endeavor to lead them away from discussion of the actual measures which have been taken to meet the actual facts of the world situation, and to follow a mirage of miscellaneous vague hopes. They seek to lead them away from their realization that the restoration now begun should not be interrupted.', 'I would recall to you the unprecedented measures which we have introduced by which we have brought the full reserve powers of the Federal Government into action to save community values and protect every family and fireside so far as it was humanly possible from deterioration.', 'We have proved time and again in our history in actual war the altruism and patriotism of our people, the solidarity of their action toward a common objective. But in this war against the invisible forces, we have seen groups of men attempting to profiteer from the miseries of our people, both to increase their own fortunes and to increase their political strength. We have seen the very measures we have taken for defense of our people and reconstruction of recovery subjected to the cheapest of political misrepresentation. We have seen attempts of these same groups even in this national emergency to bring forth a philosophy of government which would destroy the whole American system on which we have builded the greatest Nation of a century and a half.', ""Indeed, this is the same philosophy of government which has poisoned all Europe. They have been the fumes of the witch's caldron which boiled in Russia and in its attenuated flavor spread over half of Europe, and would by many be introduced into the United States in an attempt to secure votes through protest of discontent against emergency conditions. We have had to meet such handicaps from our opponents both while meeting the first emergency which endangered the Nation and in the building of employment and agriculture."", 'I have enumerated at various times in this campaign the measures adopted by the Republican administration to meet this emergency. I have enumerated on several occasions our long-view policies to cement that recovery and to stimulate progress in our country for the future. I will take your time for just a moment to refresh your minds on the unprecedented measures adopted from the beginning of this depression. I will also refresh your minds on the measures, lack of measures, or destructive measures proposed by our opponents.', '1. The first of our measures, which subsequently proved of great emergency service, was the revision of the tariff. By this act we gave protection to our agriculture from a world demoralization which would have been infinitely worse than anything we have suffered, and we prevented unemployment of millions of workmen.', '2. We have secured extension of authority to the Tariff Commission by which the adjustments can be made to correct inequities in the tariff, and to make changes to meet economic tides and emergencies, thereby avoiding the national disturbance of general revision of the tariff with all its greed and logrolling. That authority becomes of vital importance today in the face of depreciated currencies abroad.', '3. At the outset of the depression we brought about an understanding between employers and employees that wages should be maintained. They were maintained until the cost of living had decreased and the profits had practically vanished. They are now the highest real wages in the world.', 'With the concurrent agreement of labor leaders at that time to minimize strikes, we have had a degree of social stability hitherto unknown in the history of any depression in our country. We have not once in this depression had Federal troops under arms to quell conflicts which is the first time in 15 depressions over a century. I cannot pay too high a tribute to the leaders of labor, leaders of industry, and our people in general, for their intelligent self-control and their devotion to the cause of order in time of stress.', 'Last night one of the eminent orators of the Democratic Party began his speech in New York by accusing the Republican Party of waging a campaign of fear, declaring that the success of the Republican Party at the polls next Tuesday might be followed by mob disturbances to public order. How does the gentleman explain the last 3 years of unparalleled social calm ? Does he mean to charge that this magnificent body of self-disciplined citizens is suddenly overnight to become a mob ? Or does he mean to imply that his party is the party of the mob ? In either event does he mean that we must accept the threat of mob rule in the United States as a guide to our conduct on election day ? Thank God, we still have some officials in Washington that can hold out against a mob.', '4. An agreement to a spread of work where employers were compelled to reduce production was brought about in order that none might be deprived of all their living and all might participate in the existing jobs and thus give real aid to millions of families. There can be no greater service given by an industry to employees in these times.', '5. We have mobilized throughout the country private charity and local and State support for the care of distress under which our women and men have given such devoted service that the health of our country has actually improved.', '6. By the expansion of State, municipal, and private construction work as an aid to employment, and by the development of an enlarged program of Federal construction which has been maintained at the rate of $600 million a year throughout the depression, we have given support to hundreds of thousands of families.', '7. By the negotiation of the German moratorium and the standstill agreements upon external debts of that country, we saved their people from a collapse that would have set a prairie fire and possibly have involved the whole of our civilization.', '8. We created the National Credit Association by cooperation of the bankers of the country, with a capital of $500 million which prevented the failure of a thousand banks with all the tragedies to their depositors and their borrowers.', '9. By drastic reduction in the ordinary operating expenses of the Federal Government, together with the increasing of the revenues in the year 1932, we contributed to balancing the Federal budget and thus held impregnable the credit of the United States.', '10. We created the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, originally with $2 billion of resources, in order that, having maintained national credit, we should thrust the full resources of public credit behind private credit of the country and thus reestablish and maintain private enterprise in an unassailable position; that with this backing of the Federal credit, acting through existing institutions, we might protect depositors in savings banks, insurance policyholders, both lenders and borrowers in building and loan associations; through banking institutions expand the funds available for loans to merchants, manufacturers, farmers, and marketing associations; that we should protect the railways from receiverships in order that in turn railway securities in the great fiduciary institutions such as our insurance companies and savings banks might be protected and a score of millions saved from distress.', '11. In addition to strengthening the capital of the Federal land banks by $125 million we have, through the Reconstruction Corporation, made large loans to mortgage associations for the same purpose, and lately we have organized all lending agencies into cooperative action to give the farmer who wants to make a fight for his home a chance to hold it from foreclosure.', '12. We extended authorities under the Federal Reserve Act to protect beyond all question the gold standard of the United States and at the same time expand the credit in counteraction to the strangulation due to hoarding and foreign withdrawals of gold.', '13. We created the home loan discount banks with direct and indirect resources of several hundred millions, also acting through existing institutions in such fashion as to mobilize the resources of building and loan associations and savings banks and other institutions, furnishing to them cheaper and longer-term capital, to give to them the ability to save homes from foreclosure, to furnish credit to create new homes, and expand employment.', '14. We secured further authorities to the Reconstruction Corporation to assist in the earlier liquidation of deposits in closed banks in order that we might relieve distress to millions of depositors. Through Democratic opposition we failed to secure authority from Congress to carry this on a scale the country so sorely needs today.', '15. We secured increased authorities to the Reconstruction Corporation to loan up to $300 million to the States whose resources had been exhausted, to enable them to extend full relief to distress, and to prevent any hunger and cold in the United States over this winter.', '16. We increased the resources to the Reconstruction Corporation by a further $1,500 million for the undertaking of great public works which otherwise would have been delayed awaiting finance, due to the stringency of credit. These works are of a character which by their own earnings will enable disposal of the repayment of these loans without charge upon the taxpayer.', '17. We have erected a new system of agricultural credit banks with indirect resources of $300 million to reinforce the work of the intermediate credit banks and our other financing institutions in the financing of production and livestock loans to farmers. Any farmer now with sound security may go to them for aid.', '18. We have extended the authority to the Reconstruction Corporation to make loans for financing the normal movement of agricultural commodities to markets both at home and abroad.', '19. We have systematically mobilized banking and industry and business of the country with the cooperation of labor and agricultural leaders to attack the depression on every front. They have sought out and given assurance of credits to business and industry where employment would be increased, and have cooperated in relief of agricultural mortgage pressures.', '20. We have developed, together with European nations, a worldwide economic conference with view to relieving pressure upon us from foreign countries, to increase their stability, to deal with the problems of silver, and to prevent recurrence of these calamities if it can be humanly done.', '21. We have given American leadership in development of drastic reductions of armament in order to reduce our own expenditures by $200 million a year and to increase the financial stability of foreign nations and, above all, to relieve the world of fear and political friction.', 'These are a part--not all--of the great and effective weapons with which we have fought the battle that has saved the American people from disaster and chaos. These weapons are still in action and advancing along the whole front to the restoration of recovery.', 'I would call your attention to certain economic and social backgrounds of all these instrumentalities, that they are so constructed as to act through existing agencies, to avoid competition of the Government with private enterprise and responsibilities. Their essence has been that of cooperation, so created that with the passage of this emergency they can be withdrawn, leaving our economic structure in its full strength and vitality. They represent the full use of the Federal power in time of emergency to protect the people. That is the reason for the social calm in the United States as contrasted with the riots in nearly every foreign country.', 'I recently enumerated at Detroit some of the evidences of recuperation of the country under these measures in so short a period as 4 months since the destruction of public confidence by the Democratic House of Representatives ceased.', 'I do not wish to weary you with statistics, but to show the validity of that progress I may mention that in employment over a million men have now returned to work during these 4 months. This is the estimate of our Government departments. The estimate of our employers places the number at a million and a half. Certainly we are now gaining a half million a month.', 'Last night I heard an evidence--an evidence of recuperation that is going on. The city of St. Louis had made application for a large sum from the Reconstruction Corporation with which to carry their destitute over the winter. I was informed yesterday that they asked that the application for that loan be cancelled as it was no longer required.', 'Production of boots and shoes amounted to 34 million pairs in October, the highest output for any month in the year and higher than the same month of the previous year.', 'Hoarded currency continues to return; imports of gold withdrawn by frightened European holders have continued to increase; deposits of banks continue to show steady expansion. In 4 months they have increased by nearly a billion dollars. This is money being put to work and an evidence of renewed confidence.', 'A further indication of the upward movement of industry lies in the increased demand for electrical power, which has increased by over 8 percent in the last 4 months. Every business index shows some progress somewhere in the Nation.', 'I do not want to say it in criticism, for there is no one more devoted to our form of government than myself, but there is one unfortunate incident in our system, and that is that a change of parties in power at the national election may come at a difficult moment. A change at this election must mean 4 whole months in which there can be no definition of national policy, during which time not only the commander of the forces in battle for economic recovery must be changed but the subordinate commanders as well. Following the period of delay and uncertainty, the opposition party will, as it has announced, call a special session of Congress in order to validate their promises and their new deal. And whether these new policies be for better or worse, at least a year must elapse before they can emerge into action. The battle must stagnate at a time of its height, and recovery must inevitably be delayed.', 'And now in contrast with this constructive program of the Republican Party and this administration, I wish to develop for you the Democratic program to meet this depression as far as we have been able to find any definition to it. I would again call your attention to the fact that with the Democratic victory in congressional elections of 1930, their leaders promised to produce a program which would redeem this country from the depression. No such program was produced until we were well into the winter of 1932. Their program as developed under the leadership of Mr. Garner by the Democratic House of Representatives was:', '1. They passed the Collier bill, providing for destruction of the Tariff Commission by reducing it again to a mere statistical body controlled by the Congress. Had they succeeded, the relief which you so sorely require from competition with countries of depreciated currencies would today be impossible.', '2. They attempted to instruct me by legislation to call an international conference through which the aid of foreign nations would be requested to lower American tariffs, by which the independence of the United States in control of its domestic policies was to placed in the hands of an international body.', '3. They passed an act instructing me to negotiate reciprocal the result of which could only be to deprive some locality of its protection for the benefit of another, and by which the only sible agreements would involve the reduction of farm tariffs in to build up markets for other goods. I might further suggest that two largest export commodities in the country are in the hands of a gentleman who will control the next Congress.', '4. They passed an omnibus pension bill with unworthy payments as an indication of their economical temper.', '5. They passed an inadequate patchwork revenue bill, the injustices of which to different industries and groups must yet be remedied.', '6. They passed Indian claims bills to reopen settlements 75 years old in order to favor certain localities at the expense of the Public Treasury-', '7. They passed a bill instructing the Federal Reserve System and the Treasury to fix prices at averages prevailing during the years 1921 to 1929 by constantly shifting the volume of currency and credit and thus creation of every uncertainty to business and industry by a rubber dollar. This bill was stopped, but it has not been removed from their political calendar.', '8. They defeated a large part of the national economy measure proposed by the administration by their refusal to accept our recommendation, by reduction of ordinary expenditures from $250 million to less than $50 million, a part of which we subsequently rescued in the Senate.', '9. They passed the Garner-Rainey pork-barrel bill increasing expenditures by $1,200 million for unnecessary nonproductive public works, purely for the benefit of favored localities. We stopped this bill, but it is still on their political calendar.', '10. They passed the cash prepayment of the bonus calling for immediate expenditure of $2,300 million and for actual increase in liabilities of the Federal Government over the original act by $1,300 million. We stopped this bill, but it is still on their political calendar.', '11. They passed the provision for the issuance of over $2,200 million of greenback currency, a reversion to vicious practices already demonstrated in the last hundred years as the most destructive to labor, agriculture, and business. We stopped this bill and even as late as last night the Democratic candidate failed to frankly disavow it.', '12. They passed the Rainey bill providing for direct personal banking for every conceivable purpose on every conceivable security to everyone who wants money, and thus the most destructive entry of the Government into private business in a fashion that violates every principle of our Nation. I vetoed this bill, but Mr. Garner still advocates it, and it has not been removed from their political calendar.', '13. They injected an expenditure of $322 million for entirely unnecessary purposes in time of great emergency. The Democratic candidate complains daily that we do not spend this money fast enough. It is part of his economic program.', '14. The Congress passed proper authority to the Executive for reorganization and elimination of useless Government commissions and bureaus, but by refusing my recommendations for immediate action they destroyed its usefulness for a long time to come and probably destroyed its consummation.', '15. The Democratic candidate eloquently urges the balancing of the budget, but nowhere disavows these gigantic raids on the Treasury, under which no budget can ever be balanced.', 'Thus far I have recounted to you the program of the Democratic House under the leadership of Mr. Garner, whose policies have received commendation from the Democratic convention which ratified them by nominating him Vice President.', ""16. The Democratic candidate adds to this program the proposal to plant a billion trees and thereby immediately employ a million men, but the Secretary of Agriculture has shown that the trees available to plant will give them a total of less than 3 days' work."", '17. The Democratic candidate promises to relieve agriculture with a 6-point program which amounts to envisaging to distressed farmers a great structure of agricultural relief, but he has refused to submit it to debate. He has disclosed no details of the plan except six methods by which he can escape from the promise.', '18. The candidate has promised the immediate inauguration of a program of self-liquidating public works, such as utilization of our water resources, flood control, and land reclamation, to provide ""employment for all surplus labor at all times."" That is contained in a letter addressed to all the unemployed in the United States which has had enormous circulation. To employ the whole of the unemployed in the United States would exceed in cost $9 billion a year. These works are unavailable. If the works were there, the cost would destroy the credit of the Government, deprive vast numbers of the men now working of their jobs, and thus destroy the remedy itself. This fantasy is a cruel promise to these suffering men and women that they will be given jobs by the Government which no government could fulfill.', '19. The Democratic Party makes its contribution to the emergency by proposing to reduce the tariff to a ""competitive tariff for revenue."" Their candidate states that he supports this promise 100 percent. A competitive tariff today would be ruinous to American agriculture and industry.', 'These are the only reliefs to this emergency that I can find in the whole Democratic program. They are mostly destructive. I have given you some of the items of the Republican program. I submit to you this collection of 19 items which have been and are proposed to the American people.', 'Governor Roosevelt in his address of last night stated: ""I have been scrupulously careful to make no idle promises, to raise no false hopes.""', 'In St. Louis last night, I gave a list of about a dozen unclarified promises, some of which certainly raise high hopes.', 'Our opponents have devoted themselves in the last few weeks to the idea that the Republican Party is endeavoring to ""scare"" the American people. I have never found them very easily scared and would not believe the American people could be. The American people are not being disturbed by my reassurances from the record that men are being restored to employment at the rate of 500,000 a month as the result of great programs and policies inaugurated by this administration. What is disturbing the American people is the failure of the Democratic candidate to show any satisfaction in this, and his entire lack of assurance that these measures will be carried forward. Furthermore, they find a total absence of constructive proposals from the Democratic side for dealing with this emergency. They are confused by indefinite promises as to the future. They are dismayed by the measures proposed by the last Democratic House of Representatives which at no time have been disavowed by the candidate and would destroy the very foundations of the Republic. They resent appeals to protest on the basis of personal misfortune the causes of which have been so brazenly misstated. They are asking what the support of extreme radicals means to our American institutions. They wonder if the divergent parts in the Democratic Party, the sectional elements and political elements of which it consists, do not spell a repetition of the quarrels and lack of confidence in their candidate so evident before their convention, and thus an earnest of their own incapacity for united national action.', 'One issue of this campaign has become of more than normal importance, and I wish to speak on that question--that is, the maintenance of our protective tariff. These States are positively dependent upon the maintenance of protective tariffs as a measure of recovery from this depression. And the protective tariff is more in danger at this moment than at any time in recent history; first because our opponents propose to reduce this tariff to the basis of ""competitive tariff for revenue"" which means competition in the American market by the lower-paid labor, lowered standards of living, and the cheapest lands in any part of the world.', 'But beyond this the collapse of 30 nations unable to stand the accumulated strains growing out of the World War has brought about a depreciation of their currencies all the way from 10 to 50 percent. The result has been a further decrease in their wages, their prices and standards of living as compared to ours. Breaches are being made daily in your farm tariff walls.', ""I wished to make a public survey into the actual purchasing power as a consequence of wages in a number of countries to determine from their wages the amount of bread and butter which could be purchased at retail with a week's wages. I gave out those figures 4 years ago, and I gave them out several days ago. They show that in the United States nearly every group of labor can purchase somewhere between 900 and 1,000 pounds of bread and butter from their weekly wage. They showed 4 years ago that our nearest competitor, Japan, delivering goods here, could purchase there all the way from 600 to 750. They showed several days ago that this nation could only buy 100 to 159 pounds. That is the difference in wages."", 'And in the face of this, our Democratic opponents propose to reduce our tariffs. They propose to do this in violation of their historic duty and in order to appeal to other sections of the United States. Their candidate has referred to our tariff as exorbitant and a ghastly jest.', 'We must bear in mind that excepting wheat, 99 percent of our agricultural products in this and neighboring States are consumed within the borders of the United States, and the fate of American agriculture lies in holding the market within the boundaries of the United States.', 'I could give you a few indications in actual effect of the present situation other than those I stated at Des Moines, Indianapolis, Springfield. I would point out that butter, the indicator in dairy products, sells in New York at 21 cents, and yet, except for the tariff wall, it would be sold from New Zealand and Europe for 16 cents. And I would point out another exhibit: Flax is 72 cents north of the Canadian border and $1.08 south of that boundary owing to the protective tariff. These prices are depressingly low, but they actually could be lower. If this tariff were taken down, some 4 million acres, built up under the protective tariff, must go into other products, the competition of which will lower prices in every other commodity. Another industry to which Governor Roosevelt has given especial attention is sugar, as to which his promises would put another 750,000 acres into competition with other products.', 'One of the reasons why agriculture has not made progress as rapidly in increased prices in the last 4 months comparable with the increased employment of men is this increasing competition from depreciated currency countries. This indeed gives me the greatest concern. Fortunately, the Republican administration has been able to prevent the destruction of the flexible authorities of the Tariff Commission through which alone these breaches in the tariff wall might be repaired.', 'The Democratic candidate, the Democratic House of Representatives, and the Democratic Party in its platform promise consistently to destroy this authority of the Tariff Commission, and I ask: Can you look to these men to repair these breaches in the tariff wall when they propose to tear down the walls themselves ?', 'In a speech last night the Democratic candidate stated that the Tariff Commission ""during 2 long years, has investigated duties on only 73 commodities out of many thousands.""', 'Again he has been misinformed and is broadcasting misinformation to the American people. The Tariff Commission has considered over 250 items instead of the 73 he mentions. A great number of these items, when they appeared for consideration, were found to have no basis for action. They were withdrawn by the applicants upon a showing of the facts. But a greater misrepresentation lies in the fact that except for the very large task that I have recently given the Commission--that is, to reconsider the tariffs as affected by depreciated currencies owing to the collapse of foreign nations--its docket is practically clear. That means that this tribunal, which Governor Roosevelt says he will destroy, has attended to practically every tariff application presented by American citizens. If there were a greater number of items which needed change, is it not obvious that the need for this change would have been manifest, because the enterprising American citizen would long since have brought it to this tribunal for immediate adjustment ?', 'Beyond the possibilities of adjustment by the Tariff Commission, we will widen the protective tariff by legislation if necessary to protect agriculture. Our oils and fats are suffering, entirely unnecessarily, from foreign imports of these commodities. The American market should be and must be reserved for the American farmer at all times--whether emergency times or normal times.', 'Governor Roosevelt in his address last night also stated: ""I have been scrupulously careful to engage in no personalities, no unfair innuendoes, no baseless charges against the President of the United States.""', ""I would like to have someone else answer this, but it appears that I am the one to carry the answer across to the American people. I would recommend that anyone interested in this statement should read Governor Roosevelt's speeches from the beginning of this campaign."", 'I have been compelled to take the unprecedented action of calling attention to a few of them. I have been also compelled to frequently call attention to statements being put out through the Democratic National Committee and their agencies which amount to positive calumnies. In no case has the Democratic candidate disavowed this action of his official committee or agencies. He has naturally profited by his silence.', 'I have been informed in this State that someone is endeavoring to picture me as having voted in a foreign country as an indication that I am not a citizen of the United States. I know it is directed from the activities of the Democratic local committees. But why answer those things ? That picture is taken from the tax rolls of a foreign country where I at one time rented a house, and where there is a tax on every item of rent and where the rolls are made up from the tax rolls; where I never voted or had a right to vote. This has been privately and publicly denounced by the Secretary of State over the last 8 years.', 'I have just heard of another of these actions which took place yesterday in the State of Ohio--the circulation of thousands of handbills stating that the Farm Board spends $5 million annually in salaries and has a fund of $250,000 for traveling expenses. This statement is untrue. There follows a long .list of salaries purported to be paid by the Farm Board.', ""It states, incidentally, that Mr. Roosevelt will abolish the Farm Board. If that be true--but I don't believe it is true--that will be of interest to the 2 million members of farm cooperatives in the United States and especially in a great part of the Northwest."", 'As to the first point, the administrative expenditures of the Board are less than $900,000 per annum, and I would call attention to the fact that the members of the Farm Board receive about $10,000 a year. The salaries referred to in this circular do not refer largely to the employees of the Farm Board. Many are exaggerated, but the great bulk of them are officials employed by farmer-owned, farmer-controlled and farmer-managed cooperatives because they have sought for the highest skill in the marketing of their products. The Farm Board has no control of these salaries. They are paid at the will of the American farmer and his organizations. The organization you have built up in this State and the salaries are enumerated here as a matter of personal defamation of myself.', 'But the only point of importance for me to make now is that this is typical of stories being spread through the Nation with a view to misleading the people. I regret that I have to refer to them. They ought to be omitted from a political discussion.', 'Throughout the difficulties of the last 2 years there have stood out in high relief the courage and fortitude of the American people. Yet, steadfast and brave as have been our men in the face of suffering and disaster, our women have been braver and more steadfast. Upon them the rigors of the world depression, as did the rigors of the World War, have borne most heavily. Untold anxiety, self-denial, and drudgery have been their lot, that their loved ones might be assured of that care in mind and body that would equip them to meet the problems of the future. That the health of our people, both infants and adults, as evidenced by vital statistics, is now at its highest point is a notable tribute to the loving care and devotion of the women of the United States. Today their hearts are gladdened by a well founded hope of an early return to normal living conditions in our country. They must not be disappointed.', 'In the long dark days of recent months these women, bowed with the burden of their own troubles, have not been too preoccupied to send me many messages of sympathy and encouragement. Unmoved either by blind resentment or by cruel calumny, they have done much to sustain my belief in the justice as well as the courage of my countrymen. Whatever fortune may have in store for me during the remaining years of my life, my heart will ever be filled with gratitude to the women of America for the understanding, the faith, and the cooperation which they have given me without stint during all of my years of public service.', 'And not only in the homes of our country have women borne their full share of the burdens of the day. More and more in the changing conditions of modern life women have had to take their places side by side with men in factories, in business, in professional, and in political life.', ""Even before their enfranchisement, President Theodore Roosevelt realized the need for women in government when he appointed a woman to head his newly created Children's Bureau in the Department of Labor, and that office has always been held by a woman."", 'Many women are now holding posts of grave responsibility in city and county and State and Nation, and their number will be greatly increased.', 'A step forward has been taken in the last year. The first woman to represent the Government of the United States in a great international conference is Miss Mary E. Woolley, sent by me as a member of the American delegation to the Disarmament Conference at Geneva. Hers was a most distinguished service. I have appointed an imposing list of women to public duties, and they have proved to have the highest sense of service and the highest kind of ability.', 'Since the women of America attained the vote they have naturally forced certain questions into wider attention of the Nation. Education, home protection, and child welfare are as thoroughly bound up in the politics of the Nation as any other issues as a result of the enfranchisement of women.', 'I have observed in public discussions in this campaign that women frequently take a longer view of national life than do a great many men. That is natural with women. They are intensely concerned with the policies which guarantee open equality of opportunity for the future of their boys and girls. It is a comfort to find them familiar with the measures I have presented to add to this security, and they are also familiar with the lack of response with which the Democratic House met these measures.', 'I have long experienced their courageous and tenacious abilities in organization for public purposes.', 'During the Food Administration, it was my pleasure to cooperate with the women, and it was my first opportunity to see the women who organized a nation for saving that our soldiers and allies might be fed. Soon after, it was with the women that I organized the measures to save the lives of 10 million European children. Soon after, it was with the women that I organized the Better Homes movement.', 'A few years ago, when I began to organize the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection, I discovered that the great majority fitted for leadership in that work, both by skill and experience, were women. Again, when I organized the Conference on Home Building and Home Ownership and it was necessary to create research committees to present conclusions to the Conference, I found the skill and spirit with which to carry on the special work largely among women in order to get a proper perspective on the subjects because they were the persons in the community that had the experience to do it.', 'Both these conferences brought high results in the advancement of public thought. They are already ringing through our national life in concrete public action.', 'I have come to know the great abilities of our womanhood for cooperative action. They never cease nor become discouraged until success is attained.', 'Of the great problems which demand safeguard probably none arises in higher value than that of preventing wars. This is a primary necessity to the future of the Nation. We cannot, as a people, run the risk of having our whole civilization degenerated and torn apart by such grim recurrences.', 'There is a fundamental source for prevention which has been too much overlooked in this campaign. No one can deny the fact that the depression would never have taken place had it not been for the destructive forces loosened by the Great War. If we are to ensure that our country shall not be racked and endangered by recurrence of such calamities, the first measure for safety is that we should have peace in the world. We have a vital part to play in the setup of machinery to replace war and force with the peaceful settlement of controversies between the nations. We properly refuse to entangle ourselves in age-old controversies in other parts of the world. Our face is turned forward, not backward. We have taken the position that we will not participate in trying to compel people to engage in the settlement of controversies by the use of force.', 'The Kellogg Pact has been advanced by this administration to a point now accepted by the world as of far greater potency than was even contemplated at the time of its inauguration. Under the policies we have advanced, we have definitely secured that the public opinion of the world will be mobilized and concentrated against those who violate that pact.', 'The whole history of this beautiful western country constitutes a monument to the heroism of American women; and that pioneer spirit which bore so large a part in the development of the farms and firesides that now cover the western plains has come to its fullest expression during these later years in the assumption by women of a full measure of political responsibility as American citizens. My deepest appreciation is given to the army of women who have borne so valiant a part in this campaign. Their lofty conception of governmental affairs and their keen understanding of political parties and issues have given a new meaning to the history of American progress.', 'In these closing hours, I am realizing that I have been drawn more deeply into this campaign than most Presidents.', 'The emergencies with which we have been dealing during the past 30 years have called upon me for such continued and concentrated attention at the Capital of the Nation; they have been so complicated and technical; they have required such imperative and instant action, that when this campaign began I was forced to the realization that few other responsible officials of the Government held the full knowledge of all the ramifications of a program which was not yet fully understood by the country. I have felt that the President of the United States, constantly reviewing the history of our many struggles, knowing the character of our people, should never flinch in confidence in the future.', 'I deemed it due to you and to the common cause we serve to bring to you the direct story of the endeavors that have been undertaken for the common good in these past years. In the past month I have received many thousands of communications from our people. I wish to express to you and to them the comfort I have had in the realization they have given to me that their concern has traveled with mine as we have discussed together the grave issues of the period.', 'In the solemn sense that belongs to last words of this campaign, I assure you that I have endeavored, in the presentation of these issues, to appeal to the thoughtful people of the United States, that I have kept foremost in my thought the welfare of my country, that my vision has been of their homes and their necessities. And I accept this great demonstration as evidence of the support which you are giving to me out of your convictions in this battle. I have made no effort to appeal to destructive emotions; I have made an endeavor to appeal to reason which I can only hope has been effective. I have fixed my faith upon the logical conclusions of the thoughtful people who have never failed this country in any hour of danger.']",0

I have been back many times and have many friendships which have grown steadily over these years.', 'It would not be proper for me on this Sabbath Day to enter upon a discussion of political issues. Sunday is provided as a day of rest. I have certainly been engaged in hard labor, and I am thankful for the Sabbath Day.', 'I do wish to express my appreciation for the generosity of your reception. It is encouraging to any man in public service to feel the enthusiasm which comes spontaneously.', 'There is one subject on which I can speak for a moment because it is not a matter of partisanship but a matter sacred to all faiths and to all men and women. I understand that you are about to enter upon your community chest drive in order to provide against distress over the forthcoming winter. The first obligation of man is toward his neighbor. The first obligation of a community is toward those in distress, and in this drive which you are about to undertake you are giving expression to the responsibility of both the individual and the community. It is important that distress shall be cared for, and it is also important that the spirit of giving and the sense of obligation shall be maintained in our people.', 'It is true that we have provided through the Federal Government a fund to supplement the efforts of local communities by way of loans to those communities whose resources have become exhausted and who have not been able to compass the problems of distress. This has not been done to relieve the responsibility of the individual or the community; it has been done as a guarantee by the United States Government that in this time of hardship no one shall go hungry or cold within our land. The sum provided by the Government is insufficient except as a supplement to local abilities when their resources are exhausted. But it is a mark of the resolution of the American people through their Government that they will make sure that our people are protected during the national emergency.', 'There is a phase of this entire problem of distress that has been of constant lift to me; that is the fact that under the leadership of the devoted women and men of our country, the general health of our children stands today on a higher plane than even in normal times. This is the result of the infinite effort and sacrifice on the part of our people. It is fundamental that this shall go on because we as a nation cannot afford for an instant to have the powers of the next generation in the slightest way diminished if we are to continue our great march of national progress.', ""A record of national and nonpartisan effort on behalf of children was recently made in the Children's Charter, drawn up at the conclusion of the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection. That was an expression of the national spirit and national thought and the national demand on behalf of children. The people of your State were represented on that important body. Your people have taken the conclusions of this able body of men and women with the utmost seriousness. You are developing those conclusions into definite community action. In so doing you are providing for us a generation in which the problems of handicap and disability in children will be infinitely lighter than those which we bear today. In the provision of a community nurse, you are substituting her, eventually, for a score of policemen."", 'There can be no partisanship in our obligations to our children. This is a subject that is worthy of discussion on this day.', 'In opening the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection, I felt that I was voicing the feelings of fathers and mothers everywhere, without respect to political faith, when I said:', '""We approach all problems of childhood with affection. Theirs is the province of joy and good humor. They are the most wholesome part of our race, the sweetest, for they are fresher from the hands of God. Whimsical, mischievous, we live a life of apprehension as to what their opinion may be of us, a life of defense against their terrifying energy; we put them to bed with a sense of relief and a lingering of devotion. We envy them the freshness of adventure and discovery of life; we mourn over the disappointments they will meet.""', 'And in describing the ultimate goal of all our American passion for a better life for our children I said in conclusion:', '""The passion of the American fathers and mothers is to lift children to higher opportunities than they have themselves enjoyed. It burns like a flame in us as a people. Kindled in our country by its first pioneers, who came here to better the opportunities for their children rather than themselves, passed on from one generation to the next, it has never dimmed nor died. Indeed, human progress marches only when children excel their parents.""', 'To that end we can always devote some portion of our spiritual contemplation on the Sabbath Day.', 'Now, I wish to again express my appreciation for this tremendous reception. It fills me with hope. I would like to address you on questions of national issues. I shall be entering into that again tomorrow morning at an early hour.', 'I thank you.']",0

I have been using it 30 or 40 times a day for the last 15 days, and it has come near its finish.', ""I deeply appreciate your coming to give us this greeting. It is encouraging, and it is an indication of where you will be in next Tuesday's election. There are many things that are of importance to the people of Evanston in the Republican program which is now in progress. As you know, we have gone through a very great crisis in this country. It has touched even Evanston, which is far from the Atlantic seaboard. We have had a number of very important agencies established in order to give protection to our people. Some are reaching into this town at the present moment. The agriculture banks have begun to function. They have begun to enable the cattle to move towards the Middle West, and I am in hopes that in a few weeks we can see an improvement in prices."", 'We have also the problem of the protection from the tariff to the cattlemen of this territory. During the last 2 or 3 months we have had a great depreciation in currencies of foreign countries because of the collapse of their governments. It enables them to produce their cattle at less cost. It has lowered prices, increased competition, and depreciated prices for cattle. We have the authority under the Tariff Commission to have those questions reviewed. We have them under review now, and we are in hopes that we can do something to be of assistance at a very early order in that direction.', 'The program of our party has begun to show its results in the industrial world. We are now bringing back half a million men to employment in the great cities every month. They increase the consumption of animal products, and that will undoubtedly begin to reflect upon the products of this country at a very early date. Altogether the situation in the Nation is infinitely more hopeful than it was even 4 months ago.', 'There is one matter in which I have some personal interest. I came into Evanston some years ago in the matter of the Colorado River, and we at that time held hearings in this neighborhood, and we then provided for the preservation of the rights of Wyoming in the diversion of water from that great river in its lower ranges. That has worked out, I believe, of enormous assistance to your people.', 'I could talk to you a long time about matters that are of interest. I see such a large number of children here about, and they look to me to be so well cared for that I can compliment all of the women of this locality on their work in the interest of our Nation, and that is that we shall have the next generation stronger and better than ours. And it looks to me as if it is going to be so.', '[2.] ECHO, UTAH', 'My friends:', 'I am deeply grateful for your greeting upon my entering the State of Utah. I have been through Echo many a time on other missions, but in this mission which I have now, I find in your greeting a very great encouragement and an indication of what you may do tomorrow in the ballot boxes.', ""It is not an occasion when one can speak about national issues at any length, and more especially as my voice has been under a good deal of strain this last 4 weeks, and I have got to try to keep it long enough to speak to you at 12 o'clock from Salt Lake City. I am in hopes you may listen over the radio, as I will have some remarks to make about our opponents on their side and what we have done on our side."", 'But I do wish to thank you for this greeting.

9,Herbert Hoover ,"November 07, 1932","['My fellow citizens:', 'It is with difficulty that I can formulate phrases which would express my appreciation for the generosity and courtesy of your reception.', 'This is by no means my first visit to Salt Lake City. I came from the West, and one of my first professional engagements was the responsibility of carrying a chain and driving stakes on a ditch line in this State.', 'It has been a great relief and great stimulation in the last 2 days to come back to the West where I was born and reared. So I come to your State as no stranger.', 'We are going through an emergency unparalleled in the peacetime history of our country. The first great stake in this election and one which should give the deepest concern to every citizen is to save the principles on which this Nation was rounded and the ideals upon which it has grown great. The Republican administration has held that its first obligation as the party ""of the people, by the people, and for the people,"" has been to preserve the fundamentals of the Republic. In these trying times we have refused to adopt any of the evasions and resorts which have been installed by scores of other nations who have been precipitated into this crisis as the result of the World War. We have in no way countenanced the curtailment of public and private liberties. Thus we shall find, when this emergency is past, our governmental, social, and economic structure is functioning as before. And even at political cost to ourselves, we must preserve those precious forces which have builded up this Republic over 150 years.', 'In no community in all this broad land is there today any lessening of ordered liberty, of vitality, of initiative, of individual enterprise or sense of responsibility of the community or the responsibilities of the States upon all of which this Republic is based.', 'The second duty with which we were confronted was to recognize honestly the forces moving against us and to give them battle with all the reserve powers of the Federal Government, to protect our people where they were unable to protect themselves, by strengthening the State, the municipality or institution.', 'There is nothing more difficult than to face the facts unflinchingly. Nor could we afford to look at them through eyes colored by political interest. There is nothing more difficult in times of emergency than to say ""no"" to anxious people when ""yes"" would give momentary satisfaction and yet would undermine the stability of the Nation which is our first fundamental security.', 'We have provided a series of measures unprecedented in the history of the Republic. In all these measures we have preserved the recognition of the responsibility of the States, local communities, private institutions, and individual citizens. These have been tremendous undertakings and instrumentalities, unparalleled in the history of the United States. They have carried us through a crisis which, without these actions, would have left the Republic with a generation of chaos. These measures and weapons were created not only for defense in the great battle with invading forces, but they were built also for purposes of counterattack. We were delayed in this counterattack for 4 months by the destructive attitude of the Democratic House of Representatives which proposed day by day measures which pandered to sectional and group interest in preparation for this political campaign. These obstructive actions themselves have destroyed public confidence during that time.', 'We were thus fighting not only on the front preserving the Republic, but fighting an irresponsible enemy on our flank. It was not until we had defeated the flank attack that we were able to concentrate on the frontline of battle and carry the frontline trenches. We are moving forward today. A million men in 4 months have been restored to their normal jobs. Our agencies report that they are being taken back at the rate of 500,000 a month. So great has been the transformation in certain centers that in the great city of St. Louis where they had secured a large loan from the Reconstruction Corporation in order to care for the destitute, they are surrendering most of the loan back to the Government. With a magnificent sense of courage and community spirit and individual responsibility they announce that they can now take care of their own because of the increasing number of men who have returned to employment. I have just received a telegram showing that employment and business in all of the New England States, after deducting all seasonal factors, increased nearly 10 percent in the last 4 months.', 'I regret that agriculture has been lagging behind industry in this march to recovery. The reasons are, first, because our domestic markets must be reestablished by the reemployment of men; second, because we have met a new blow through depreciation of currencies in 30 governments which have collapsed under strains from the aftermath of the Great War. Their currencies have depreciated all the way from 10 percent to 50 percent, and depreciation of currency means reduction of wages and of standards of living. It has further increased their capacity to compete with our farmers. It has created breaches in the protective tariff wall which stands as the bulwark of our agricultural industry. Our first and immediate duty now is to repair these breaches in order that agriculture may resume a march forward parallel with industry within the next 30 days. That we shall do, either through the flexible tariff provision or, if necessary, through legislation. We propose to preserve the American market for the American farmer. You will realize that in these Intermountain States of ours nearly 99.5 percent of all your products are marketed within the borders of the United States, and that what you require is the protection of that market.', 'The Democratic campaign has been conducted from the start upon the theory that by misrepresenting the origins of this crisis as having been brought about by the Republican administration, they could then successfully play politics with human. misery. This pretext has been exploded. It was based on the assumption that the American people were an ignorant people, without knowledge of history or of current events. It was assumed they had no recollection that just such a crisis followed the Napoleonic wars, just such a crisis followed the Civil War and the wars in Europe which took place a few years later. They pretended that the World War had nothing to do with this crisis. They estimated that our people could not grasp the fact that increases in our own public debts due to the World War, together with the effect of the enormous inflation in values which took place during the war, had anything to do with our problems today. This indeed was an avoidance of the fact that these things all occurred under a Democratic administration. They assumed that our people were so ignorant as not to recognize that the overwhelming debts of foreign nations from increasing armaments from their continuing frictions, and finally their frantic attempts to secure their national liquidation, brought about the collapse of a great number of nations.', 'They assumed that the knowledge of these events and their effects upon us by their undermining of our credit, their reduction of buying power for our goods, were all unknown to the American people. They have had the political foolishness to misjudge that the intelligence of the American people would accept their claim that a boom on the New York Stock Exchange, participated in by Democrats as well as Republicans, was the cause of this world calamity. They attempted to establish this claim in spite of the fact that we have had similar booms 15 times in the last century, and deplorable as they are, they have never yet jeopardized our Republic or brought catastrophe on the world.', 'They have in this campaign also relied upon the spread of misinformation to convince the American people that the great final blow which brought the world to disaster was through the passage of the increased tariffs under the Hawley-Smoot act which took place 12 months after that boom had cracked. Most of those increases were for the benefit of our farmers. They attempted this particular foolishness in spite of the fact that it has been demonstrated time and again that this tariff law affected only $10 out of every $1,000 of world trade, and that similar increases many, many times before in our history, when we had to recover protection from Democratic administrations, had had no effect on the world. All of this gigantic pose was designed to fool the people.', 'We have pointed out on many occasions that this refusal to recognize the facts, this attempt to mislead the people, disqualifies that party for the Government of the United States. Again, I repeat that the object in all of this misleading is to find some way to place on the Republican Party the responsibility for this worldwide disaster, and thus to draw members of the Republican Party to their banner out of discontent. Furthermore, their strategy in this campaign was to rely upon the solid South as. an impregnable fortress in a political battle. They then would use their political brigades in the great cities. They sought by these misrepresentations, by nebular promises directed to the unemployed, to the farmers, to the miners, to every industry that is suffering, to attract from the Republican ranks a sufficient number to carry this election. They have, instead, driven many honest minded Democrats from their ranks, and their failure to draw thinking Republicans will be their rebuke for intellectual dishonesty.', 'The Republican Party, confronted with the greatest crisis that has come in peacetime, prepared and carried through a gigantic program. That program is in action now. It is showing its results.', 'When we search for their program with which to meet this depression, and their real views on long-view national action, we find ourselves compelled to search a series of acts passed in the last session of the Democratic House, calculated to attract sections, groups, and radical elements to their banner. They expounded here and elsewhere through their candidate a philosophy of government that would have destroyed the foundations of the Republic. Their party convention, by the nomination of Mr. Garner, ratified these acts. Their candidate for President, having failed to disavow them, has also ratified them.', 'I ask you to compare my review of their program for meeting this emergency, as outlined by me in an address at St. Paul and elsewhere, with the program which the Republican administration has already in action. Their long-view policies have the same weaknesses and the same evasions in frankly meeting national problems as their emergency program. In my addresses I have presented proof, step by step, of these facts. I have exposed their misstatements and their avoidances and their fallacies and their destructive philosophy of government. On the last point I have the gravest concern. If that philosophy were ever put into action, the America we have known in the past would be changed, and we would join with other decaying nations. Such a program put into action would destroy those principles which have given to us through these decades our great accretions of national progress, and which have sustained every man in his personal liberty and sustained the protection of his individual opportunity and has sustained the ideals of a great people.', 'The discussions in this campaign have largely revolved on economic issues and our material welfare, but there are issues in the campaign which far transcend the interest of our pocketbooks. While the immediate issue is to overcome this crisis, far beyond this is the higher duty to maintain faith in and fidelity to our institutions. These are the most necessary part of our problems of government and the problems of your life and of my life.', 'In all great crises our decisions have not been based on dollars and cents. When our people look anxiously toward the future they look to the preservation of our liberties and the safety of our institutions. We are a people devoted not to our own immediate self-interest, but we are concerned with the fate of our children and their children.', 'In this campaign, knowing the responsibilities of the Presidential office as I do, I have felt that I was leading a cause vital to the future of my country and to my children.', 'There is no community where the building up of the home and the advancement of children born amid the handicaps of the desert has called for more sacrifice by men and women, and where its hopes have been more nearly attained than in this city. I ask you to traverse the program which has been laid down by the Democratic Party, their program for long-view policies, and determine whether you think the growth which you have made here in the last 75 years can be continued if you project yourselves for the next 75 years into such a program.', ""I need not explain to you the principles of the protective tariff nor how dependent the Intermountain States are upon its maintenance. I may mention one fact alone and that is, outside of wheat 99.5 percent of your farmers' market depends upon the protective tariff. Nor do I need to point out to you that the only occasion upon which the Democratic candidate has expressed himself upon any particular schedule of the tariff was in a communication through the Cuban press to express his sympathy for the Cuban ambition to remove the tariff on sugar. And I might further call your attention to the explanation given, when confronted with the query as to whether this meant he would remove the sugar tariff, that he would not discuss any particular schedule. The same reply was made when he was asked what he would do about the tariff which today is the sole protection of your cattle and sheep industry, as distressed as prices may be."", 'Now, I submit that if any man is competent to discuss the protective tariff he must know whether the different schedules are too high or too low. He must also know that through the Tariff Commission these schedules can be instantly subjected to reexamination, and if found at fault they can be instantly remedied. I have repeatedly offered to submit any such schedule from the Democratic candidate to the Tariff Commission for their action. As I have stated elsewhere, his reply, when asked why he does not submit these facts or these faults in our tariff in order that they may be remedied, is that he will abolish the independent authority of the Tariff Commission.', 'I do not need to reiterate that I stand flatly for the protective tariff. I stand for the protective tariff which means always the preservation of the American market for the American producer. Further, I stand for the speedy repair of the breaches in its walls which have been made by the depreciation of foreign currencies as a result of this worldwide calamity.', 'This morning I issued the following statement, to the press which explains itself and is as follows:', '""My attention has been called to the misrepresentation by Democratic agencies upon the question of the restriction of Philippine sugar. The Democratic Hawes-Hayes bill provides for a probation for Philippine independence varying from 9 to 17 years, during which time the quota of sugar which can be imported free is to be increased from the present average of the last few years of about 600,000 tons up to 850,000 tons. At the end of that period a catastrophe will come to the Philippine people through the total break of their duty-free trade relations with us.', '""The Republican proposal is of a gradually modified relationship with the Philippines. We say that they cannot in their own interest attain political independence until they have secured economic independence. They depend for their prosperity upon being within the tariff laws of the United States. We therefore say that their amount of duty-free sugar and of other commodities must not be increased at all, but on the contrary must start, in the case of sugar, at 600,000 tons and be reduced every year in order to gradually establish their economic independence. That is in the interest of both the Philippines and the American farmer, and the Democratic proposal is not in the interest of the Filipinos or our farmers.', '""The Democratic proposal continues and makes worse the situation of the American farmer for 9 to 17 years and in the end plunges the Philippines into ruin as the price of their liberty. The Republican proposal, as usual a constructive proposal, gives immediate relief to the beet sugar grower and our other producers and brings about a safe basis of Philippine independence.""', 'And I wish to mention here and now that in securing these additional authorities to the Tariff Commission 2 years ago by which we have taken the tariff out of logrolling and placed it on a sound and effective basis and on a basis which can meet the emergencies with which we are now confronted, Senator Smoot of your State led not only in this fight but also in the fight for the protection of your industries in Utah and for the protection of the entire Nation. And I wish to make one other point. Senator Smoot is the doyen of the United States Senate. By his long service which has continued longer than any other Senator, he has a knowledge of the workings of the United States Government unparalleled by any other man in the United States Senate. It is necessary that Senator Smoot return to the United States Senate where he has given such untiring devotion to his constituents and has not attempted to promote local interests where they were in conflict with the interests of the country as a whole. Two of the political leaders in your neighboring State told me within an hour that they would be glad to have Senator Smoot for the campaign in their State.', 'This has been a campaign of peculiar misrepresentation from our opponents through failure to properly advise the Governor of New York as to facts and the consequent broadcasting time and again of misinformation both as to the origin of events and the actions taken with regard to them and in matters of common statistical accuracy which change the arguments.', 'One of these misrepresentations local to the Intermountain States has been as to my position as to silver. If I had no broader vision than my personal sympathy with every man who works with pick and shovel in the mines, every superintendent, and every owner of a mine, to which industry I devoted myself over a term of years, I would be anxious that their product could be salable at a price which would maintain their livelihood and the prosperity of these States from the national point of view. Increase in the value of silver would relieve us from strains of cheap production of goods which flow over our borders; it would rehabilitate the buying power of many foreign nations for our goods. We have long since determined that there can be but one standard of monetary value and that is gold, but yet we should restore silver to greater use for subsidiary coinage and other purposes in those countries which traditionally have used it and to do it without undermining the gold standard. The problem in the expansion of the use of silver thus becomes a problem which cannot be solved without international action.', 'For a score of years the Congress has been passing resolutions asking for an international conference for this purpose. I took the proper steps many months ago through our diplomatic agents to inquire of the nations, without whose attendance such a conference would be impossible, as to whether or not they would be willing to join in such a conference. They stated they were unwilling to do so at that time. Later on, when the question arose of a world economic conference to consider steps by which the international phases of this stupendous crisis could be further relieved, I stipulated as a condition of American entry into that conference that there should be considered also the methods for the restoration of the use and price of silver as a full part in that conference. That was finally accepted. I have given assurances to the people of the Intermountain region that I shall appoint a representative on the American delegation who will carry their point of view to that conference.', 'I call your attention to the fact that in the history of 30 years this is the only administration which has won for you the consideration of this question by the nations of the world and eight of those years have been Democratic administrations.', ""I have referred to my early visits to this State. The pursuit of that same profession as an engineer took me into many lands peopled by many races, living under strange and diverse philosophies of life and many different forms of government. Later, during the World War in Europe, I saw men of all these origins gathered on the fields of battle waging the deadliest war in human history. I am perhaps the only man who was permitted to move within the battle zone and freely among the people on both sides of the conflict when it was in action. In my mission I discussed--merely as a matter of discernment for my own use--the war with statesmen and generals on all sides of the conflict. Their leaders had summoned their people to arms on every one of a dozen different pleas that are made to persuade men to risk their lives upon the issues of war. Some had been called to resist a hateful philosophy of government; some had been called to preserve their national existence; some had been called to guarantee with their blood a theory of their country's economic interest."", 'Now I would be the last man in the world to say that war is never justified. Many men of my own family have borne arms. I myself in the course of the World War repeatedly stated that I was prepared to serve my country in any capacity from that of laborer to that of soldier in the frontline trenches. There are issues for which it is right that men, if need be, should sacrifice their lives to defend them.', 'Nevertheless, I had at that time 4 years of unique personal observation of the horrors of war, 4 years of study of its causes, and after the armistice I had another year in endeavor to stem the tide of famine to save the children and to reestablish economic life in Europe. I then had another 8 years of intimate study of its appalling aftermaths in dealing with the foreign commerce of our country. And I have grappled daily, in my last 30 years as President in the most responsible office of government in the world, with the fearful aftermaths which had overwhelmed the world from war. All these experiences have impressed upon my mind with ineradicable vividness the colossal error of war as an instrument of national policy. I have learned the futility of war as a solvent of great human problems, and I have perceived the fearful toll that war takes of the generations succeeding the one which fought the battles.', 'Indelibly impressed upon my deepest emotions is the profound conviction that the very first of all problems pressing upon the human race generally, in its large assemblage of nations, is the problem of prevention of future wars. The greatest safety of the world from these crises we are now passing is to prevent war. I see this not only in its terms of crushing economic burdens, not only in its fearful disorganization and dislocation of economic life for years to come, not only in its crushing burdens of taxation for generations innocent of responsibility, I see it far more intensely as a supreme human problem.', ""I see in wars the loss of the glorious young manhood of the world who, but for war's slaughter, would lead the bright columns of human hope and human idealism and human progress to levels far above the past. I see wars in terms of women, widowed or unwed, with fond hopes blasted of homes and children. I see war's most lamentable casualties in homes wrecked and in homes that never even had their chance of being. I see wars in terms of children born into lives foredoomed to ignorance and the toil that dwarfs both mind and spirit. I see war's fatal poison subtly invading the moral ideals of the people, bringing grossness and cynicism where should grow the fine flower of idealism. The world has seen enough of a postwar peace that is not peace, but rather smoulders on in racial hatreds."", 'For these reasons, it has been a major purpose through all of my administration to guide the foreign policy of this Nation so as to maintain our traditional peace with amity with all nations. But, of even more importance, I have sought to do everything in my power to place the full weight of the moral strength of the American people behind every agency, existing or that can be devised, which has for its purpose the upbuilding of the spirit of peace in the world and the maintenance of peace among nations. I have made but one reservation, and that is, we will join no movement that proposes to use military or economic force in its attempts to prevent war. For that is a contradiction in method.', 'And there has been real accomplishment in this direction by our country in this 3 1/2 years. Through strengthening of the Kellogg Pact, beyond even the scope visioned by my predecessor, its great proponent, we have accomplished its acceptance by the entire world as an effective agency through which the moral influence of the world can be, and more than once has been, effectively mobilized to prevent war and sustain peace. The force behind that is the force of mobilized public opinion of the world. That is the greatest force which the world can command. We have sought and secured a large measure of disarmament. We are today placing our every influence to secure further disarmament.', 'If time permitted, I could enumerate a score of other measures and policies and individual cases in which the United States Government, representing the passion of our people for world peace, has been able to advance that cause by practical and effective action.', 'And if it shall be the will of this Nation that for another 4 years I shall continue to lead in the execution of their purposes, they may be assured, both by the pledge of past endeavor and by my solemn pledge for future endeavor, and by the further knowledge of my personal conviction and deep emotion on this subject, that then for yet another 4 years this Nation shall continue to advance in leadership toward the precious goal of worldwide and enduring peace.']",0
10,Herbert Hoover ,"November 07, 1932","['[1] OGDEN, UTAH (2:15 p.m.)', 'My friends:', 'It is difficult to find words to express oneself adequate in gratitude for so fine a reception.', 'There are one or two matters of national interest on which I should like to talk a moment with you. The first one of those applies to the question of the working people in the United States. Ogden is particularly a center of industry. You will recollect that in the first month of this depression we brought about an agreement between the employers and the leaders of employees of the Nation that there should be no reductions of wages--that wages should be sustained. And you will recollect that after more than 2 years, not until after the cost of living had decreased and the profits of industry had vanished that that agreement was held. I call your attention to it because this is the first time in the history of 15 depressions in the United States that the first action of the Government has been to protect the working family and the working home. Furthermore, we have sought to give that same protection continuously over this period.', 'Through an administrative order I stopped all immigration into the United States. Had immigration gone on at its normal rate we should have had another half a million men in the United States today to labor in competition with you at the doors of our works and factories. We have continued in that protection. And if you examine the buying power of wages in the United States today, somewhat depressed though they may be, you will find that it is greater in proportion at this moment than it was 4 years ago in comparison with foreign nations. In other words, whatever our difficulties may have been, we have sustained the working family in the United States more fully than any other government in the world. It has been our purpose not only that we should sustain the buying power of our working people, which puts us on a very low level, but it has been a higher purpose that we should remove all cause for industrial conflict in the United States. And we have witnessed for the first time amongst 15 depressions of a century that we have had no consequential industrial disturbances. The number of strikes and lockouts have not only been less in this than in those previous depressions but they have been very much less than even those in the normal course of American life. And in that, there is a tribute to all the working people of the United States and to our employers for a steadfast purpose to maintain the social calm of this country in a period of great crisis.', 'Now, there are many other points which I could go into. The unprecedented measures we have undertaken to carry this country through this crisis have had the greatest success in warding off the calamities which have overturned other nations. The construction work we have undertaken has been three times that known in history; the stimulation of private work; the initiation of another billion and a half of work through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation; and finally the placing of the Federal Government behind all of the States in an assurance that there shall be at this calamitous time no single home in which hunger and cold shall enter--those are actions of a government solicitous for the welfare of the working people of the United States. And I am happy to tell you that during the last 4 months, since we have had freedom from the endeavors of the Democratic House of Representatives through its destruction of public confidence, that the measures which we have initiated have begun to show their effects. Over a million of men, up to the end of October, had been returned to work, and they are returning today at the rate of over 500,000 a month. And I have had telegrams as well the last 2 days from every section of the country showing that this reemployment is improving day by day. We are, I am confident, on the way out now.', 'And there are other matters of vital interest to the working people as well as the agricultural people. Every product of this State, from its copper to its sugar, to its lead, to its vegetable products, to its wool, and its cattle are dependent on the maintenance of the protective tariff. Our opponents have assured us that they are going to reduce those tariffs. They talk at times differently in the West from what they do in the East. But nevertheless, the historic action of the party at all times, the promises in their platform, the promises of their candidate can assure that if they are placed in power you will have to meet that catastrophe within the State of Utah.', 'Now, there are other questions of vital importance. They are questions that reach to the very philosophy and basis of our Government that are at stake in this election. To those ends I have endeavored in this campaign by presentation in a manner unprecedented by any President to bring before the American people the concrete facts, and to appeal to their logic, their sense, and their thought, with the hope that they would base their action not upon destructive emotion but upon constructive emotion and upon the logic of their own interest.', 'I want to thank you again for your reception. It is encouraging. It is hopeful. It is helpful, and it is a sign of what you will do on the 8th day of November.', '[2] ELKO, NEVADA (7 p.m.)', 'My friends:', ""At this stage of the campaign my voice has gone somewhat the way that I find Senator Oddie's has gone. I am glad to have an opportunity to speak to you a moment because I want to say something about the Senator."", ""I understand that the usual misrepresentation which seems to be the accompaniment of all the activities of our opponents these days has been directed against the Senator on the silver question. I know something about the history of that problem. I recollect very vividly the Senator's visit to China and the East and his return to Washington and his urgency of the necessity that something must be done in connection with silver if we were to restore the buying power of those countries and if we were to prevent them from manufacturing goods so cheaply as to flood our markets. In response to his urging I made inquiry of the principal nations of Europe as to whether they would accept an invitation to come to a conference in the United States to consider the entire problem, not from the point of view of displacing the gold standard, but from the point of view of increasing the use of silver throughout the world for subsidiary coinage and other purposes. I found unfortunately that some of the other nations were not prepared to enter upon the question at that time, and it went over after considerable delay."", 'The Senator never lost an opportunity to urge action. In fact, I came to more or less dislike him because of his pertinacity on the question. Nevertheless, at a later stage the question arose of an international conference to consider the whole of the problem of this depression, to see if we could find a method by which we would prevent these calamities which had happened from the failures of Europe. And I made it a condition of our attendance at that conference that the silver question should be taken up and should be considered as if it were a separate conference on silver. Then I had to go back to the Senator to secure an appropriation with which to send our delegation to that conference, and he helped in the Senate to secure that appropriation.', 'I have gone even further in this matter and have said that I will select somebody on the recommendation of our leaders in the West as a member of the American delegation that goes to that conference who will represent the western point of view on the silver question. So that you can disabuse your mind of any misrepresentations that have been made about the Senator because I know the character of the people that make them.', 'I am most appreciative of this reception. It is most heartening. It is encouraging as to what you may do on next Tuesday. We have gone through a great crisis. We have adopted unprecedented measures. We have brought our country through that period with less damage than any other country in the world that has been involved in it. Our measures were measures not only of defense but measures of counterattack, and since the chairman of the Democratic House of Representatives made a second destruction of public confidence--up until this gentleman had left Washington that program was beginning to work. And it has shown its results in the fact that, as I have said several times in the last few days, a million men will have returned to work before the end of October. I notice today that the American Federation of Labor revises my figures and puts them up 300,000 higher; in other words, that 1,300,000 have already been restored to their jobs, and they are being restored at the rate of more than 500,000 a month.', 'Another point that I might pass on to you that I have no doubt Senator Oddie has explained to you before, and that is the tariff. Our opponents promise you to reduce the tariff, and disheartening as the prices of our agricultural products are, they are far higher than the prices of any of our competing countries, and our prices would not hold if the tariff were taken down. Our policy has been not only to hold that tariff up but to strengthen it further.', 'And now I thank you again for your reception. I must not address you any further because I will have nothing left for this last radio speech tonight.', 'Thank you.']",0
11,Herbert Hoover ,"November 08, 1932","['[1] COLFAX, CALIFORNIA (Rear platform)My friends of Nevada County:', ""I am deeply affected by your welcome. It is difficult to formulate phrases to express the feelings of one's heart on that part of a touching recollection. I recollect the full facts, and I recollect Nevada County with a peculiar vividness because at that age and that time in life one remembers everything that happens. When you are from 15 to 22 or thereabouts, everything is an adventure and everything is an event. As we get along further in life we don't mind, so much, some of us, what happened this month or next month. But at the time I spent in Nevada County I remember everything--the Harmony Mine, and I remember the Grass Valley and the Mayflower and the mine where I worked at one time. All of it I remember, and I remember the road all of the way from here to Nevada City and back again. I have recollections of Colfax from many hundreds of passages through later on, but none are so vivid as at that time."", ""It is fine of you to come down to welcome me so early in the morning. I have to get up about 6 o'clock in the morning to do my normal job, but I didn't know anybody else in the world had to.

I think probably one of the disappointments of the last 4 years has been the inability to leave Washington for more than a night's journey because of the most difficult and terrible crisis which the United States has been going through."", ""The election is on today. Most of you have come to your own conclusions. There are many things that California is interested in in this election. All of our industries, practically, are supported by the protective tariff. However, our opponents say that they will reduce the tariff. California has seen in the last Democratic administration nine-tenths of the products of California placed on the free list, and if it had not been for the intervention of the World War, California's industries would have been destroyed. We are now faced with the same problem. And you have many problems which are important not alone to agriculture. California has many industries besides agriculture which are interested in the protective tariff."", 'I was reading this morning a circular put out by some labor organization here asking why I refused to employ white labor on the ranch I own at Palo Alto. I may say to you in reply to that that I am not unwilling to answer that question. I have not hesitated, and I have no hesitation now in answering any question during the whole of this campaign. First, I have no ranch at Palo Alto, only owning a half acre of ground there. Second, up to 2 years ago I had an interest in a ranch in the San Joaquin Valley, and the photographs which are being circulated were taken about a year and a half ago by a political trick.', 'And that leads me to make a remark on the conduct of the campaign here in California particularly. There has been such unceasing misrepresentation by the Congress of California, and particularly by the press of William Randolph Hearst, that one would have thought that the President of the United States, although he had come from the State of California, was a monster.', 'No attention has been particularly given to the people of California of the tremendous crisis through which the world has passed; the dangers that have been warded off from the American people; and that much as has been the distress we have had, we can point with pride to the fact that there is no starvation and cold in our country as there has been in every other country attacked by this calamity. We can point to the fact that we have made more progress than any other country in the world in emergence from that calamity.', 'During the last 2 or 3 days I can say that our Government departments have stated that during the last 4 months a million of men have been returned to their normal jobs. Last night I received the correction of that statement. The American Federation of Labor does not agree with my statement. They place the month of September increases of employment at 560,000 when I estimated it at 360,000. That increase has been more rapid than I had anticipated, and with that ratio of increase of 1,500,000 men returned to their jobs as the result of the constructive measures which we have introduced in Washington for the benefit of every family and fireside in the United States; the picture of the presentation of those measures has been distorted and has been misrepresented morning, noon, and night to the people of California.', 'I have gotten on to a vein which I had not thought to discuss because of the statement which was presented to me a few moments ago.', 'But I do want to express to you my gratitude for the welcome which you have given to me back to my native State--my State of California. I established my home here 17 years ago, and it has been my home ever since that time. The major absences from this State I have given in public service to the American people.

I felt it was a homecoming not to the President of the United States but the homecoming of a fellow Californian.', 'Four years now our Nation has been in the depths of the greatest crisis ever known in its peacetime history. It has been involved in the fears of the calamities of a score of nations. I have not felt that California would want their representative in the Presidency to leave his station of duty for even an hour when it was necessary for national good. I have therefore not been away from the National Capital for more than a night for over 2 1/2 years. Now that things are becoming better, now that the country has turned the tide and is moving toward recovery with great rapidity, I have felt justified in returning back to my State to vote.

Until this journey, I have not in 2ð years been able to be away from the Capital of the Nation for more than a night's journey. But the measures that have been taken by our administration have now proved such overwhelming evidence of the turn of the tide that I have felt justified in returning home to vote with my neighbors."", 'The other day a man discovered a fact that I had known for most of my life--that my first registration as a voter at the age of 21 was across the bay from this city and for the purpose of voting for President McKinley.', 'Now, the receptions I have had at every station and in every town since early this morning will remain as a never-to-be-forgotten memory of welcome, not as President of the United States but as a fellow Californian. This I feel to be the spirit today in this my home city. I have had memories raised as I have driven out from the ferry. Many landmarks have been wiped away before the march of progress.', 'I get a special joy out of the mass of children who have come to see me along the way and who are here in such numbers today. They are the dearest product of California, these our healthy, ambitious children. They are the sweetest things in our lives because they are nearest from the hands of God.', 'I wish again to express my gratification for the generosity, the courtesy, and the enthusiasm of your welcome. It is not my purpose to discuss national issues at this time. Today is the day when you are registering your views on the future conduct of your country. That is the most solemn act of your citizenship. You have already made your determinations, and the result will greatly depend upon the views expressed by my own State.', 'I have represented California for 4 years in the Presidency of the United States, and in many other years prior to that I have represented my country in great national undertakings. I can say to you that the name of California is wider known, the glories of its hills, valleys, and of its people have wider spread because of that, and there has been no time when the esteem of the Nation or the world for California and its ideals has not been upheld by my representation of your State.', '[5] PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA (Memorial Court, Stanford University)My friends:', 'I am just glad to come home. I have brought back everything with me except my voice. I can tell you the emotions of occasions like this are too much for expression. I just thank you.']",0
