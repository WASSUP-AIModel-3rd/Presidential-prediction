0,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"June 27, 1936","['Senator Robinson, Members of the Democratic Convention, my friends:', 'Here, and in every community throughout the land, we are met at a time of great moment to the future of the Nation. It is an occasion to be dedicated to the simple and sincere expression of an attitude toward problems, the determination of which will profoundly affect America.', 'I come not only as a leader of a party, not only as a candidate for high office, but as one upon whom many critical hours have imposed and still impose a grave responsibility.', 'For the sympathy, help and confidence with which Americans have sustained me in my task I am grateful. For their loyalty I salute the members of our great party, in and out of political life in every part of the Union. I salute those of other parties, especially those in the Congress of the United States who on so many occasions have put partisanship aside. I thank the Governors of the several States, their Legislatures, their State and local officials who participated unselfishly and regardless of party in our efforts to achieve recovery and destroy abuses. Above all I thank the millions of Americans who have borne disaster bravely and have dared to smile through the storm.', 'America will not forget these recent years, will not forget that the rescue was not a mere party task. It was the concern of all of us. In our strength we rose together, rallied our energies together, applied the old rules of common sense, and together survived.', 'In those days we feared fear. That was why we fought fear. And today, my friends, we have won against the most dangerous of our foes. We have conquered fear.', 'But I cannot, with candor, tell you that all is well with the world. Clouds of suspicion, tides of ill-will and intolerance gather darkly in many places. In our own land we enjoy indeed a fullness of life greater than that of most Nations. But the rush of modern civilization itself has raised for us new difficulties, new problems which must be solved if we are to preserve to the United States the political and economic freedom for which Washington and Jefferson planned and fought.', 'Philadelphia is a good city in which to write American history. This is fitting ground on which to reaffirm the faith of our fathers; to pledge ourselves to restore to the people a wider freedom; to give to 1936 as the founders gave to 1776—an American way of life.', ""That very word freedom, in itself and of necessity, suggests freedom from some restraining power. In 1776 we sought freedom from the tyranny of a political autocracy—from the eighteenth century royalists who held special privileges from the crown. It was to perpetuate their privilege that they governed without the consent of the governed; that they denied the right of free assembly and free speech; that they restricted the worship of God; that they put the average man's property and the average man's life in pawn to the mercenaries of dynastic power; that they regimented the people."", 'And so it was to win freedom from the tyranny of political autocracy that the American Revolution was fought. That victory gave the business of governing into the hands of the average man, who won the right with his neighbors to make and order his own destiny through his own Government. Political tyranny was wiped out at Philadelphia on July 4, 1776.', ""Since that struggle, however, man's inventive genius released new forces in our land which reordered the lives of our people.. The age of machinery, of railroads; of steam and electricity; the telegraph and the radio; mass production, mass distribution—all of these combined to bring forward a new civilization and with it a new problem for those who sought to remain free."", 'For out of this modern civilization economic royalists carved new dynasties. New kingdoms were built upon concentration of control over material things. Through new uses of corporations, banks and securities, new machinery of industry and agriculture, of labor and capital—all undreamed of by the fathers—the whole structure of modern life was impressed into this royal service.', 'There was no place among this royalty for our many thousands of small business men and merchants who sought to make a worthy use of the American system of initiative and profit. They were no more free than the worker or the farmer. Even honest and progressive-minded men of wealth, aware of their obligation to their generation, could never know just where they fitted into this dynastic scheme of things.', 'It was natural and perhaps human that the privileged princes of these new economic dynasties, thirsting for power, reached out for control over Government itself. They created a new despotism and wrapped it in the robes of legal sanction. In its service new mercenaries sought to regiment the people, their labor, and their property. And as a result the average man once more confronts the problem that faced the Minute Man.', ""The hours men and women worked, the wages they received, the conditions of their labor—these had passed beyond the control of the people, and were imposed by this new industrial dictatorship. The savings of the average family, the capital of the small business man, the investments set aside for old age—other people's money—these were tools which the new economic royalty used to dig itself in."", 'Those who tilled the soil no longer reaped the rewards which were their right. The small measure of their gains was decreed by men in distant cities.', 'Throughout the Nation, opportunity was limited by monopoly. Individual initiative was crushed in the cogs of a great machine. The field open for free business was more and more restricted. Private enterprise, indeed, became too private. It became privileged enterprise, not free enterprise.', 'An old English judge once said: ""Necessitous men are not free men."" Liberty requires opportunity to make a living—a living decent according to the standard of the time, a living which gives man not only enough to live by, but something to live for.', ""For too many of us the political equality we once had won was meaningless in the face of economic inequality. A small group had concentrated into their own hands an almost complete control over other people's property, other people's money, other people's labor—other people's lives. For too many of us life was no longer free; liberty no longer real; men could no longer follow the pursuit of happiness."", ""Against economic tyranny such as this, the American citizen could appeal only to the organized power of Government. The collapse of 1929 showed up the despotism for what it was. The election of 1932 was the people's mandate to end it. Under that mandate it is being ended."", ""The royalists of the economic order have conceded that political freedom was the business of the Government, but they have maintained that economic slavery was nobody's business. They granted that the Government could protect the citizen in his right to vote, but they denied that the Government could do anything to protect the citizen in his right to work and his right to live."", 'Today we stand committed to the proposition that freedom is no half-and-half affair. If the average citizen is guaranteed equal opportunity in the polling place, he must have equal opportunity in the market place.', 'These economic royalists complain that we seek to overthrow the institutions of America. What they really complain of is that we seek to take away their power. Our allegiance to American institutions requires the overthrow of this kind of power. In vain they seek to hide behind the Flag and the Constitution. In their blindness they forget what the Flag and the Constitution stand for. Now, as always, they stand for democracy, not tyranny; for freedom, not subjection; and against a dictatorship by mob rule and the over-privileged alike.', 'The brave and clear platform adopted by this Convention, to which I heartily subscribe, sets forth that Government in a modern civilization has certain inescapable obligations to its citizens, among which are protection of the family and the home, the establishment of a democracy of opportunity, and aid to those overtaken by disaster.', 'But the resolute enemy within our gates is ever ready to beat down our words unless in greater courage we will fight for them.', 'For more than three years we have fought for them. This Convention, in every word and deed, has pledged that that fight will go on.', 'The defeats and victories of these years have given to us as a people a new understanding of our Government and of ourselves. Never since the early days of the New England town meeting have the affairs of Government been so widely discussed and so clearly appreciated. It has been brought home to us that the only effective guide for the safety of this most worldly of worlds, the greatest guide of all, is moral principle.', 'We do not see faith, hope and charity as unattainable ideals, but we use them as stout supports of a Nation fighting the fight for freedom in a modern civilization.', 'Faith— in the soundness of democracy in the midst of dictatorships.', 'Hope—renewed because we know so well the progress we have made.', 'Charity— in the true spirit of that grand old word. For charity literally translated from the original means love, the love that understands, that does not merely share the wealth of the giver, but in true sympathy and wisdom helps men to help themselves.', 'We seek not merely to make Government a mechanical implement, but to give it the vibrant personal character that is the very embodiment of human charity.', 'We are poor indeed if this Nation cannot afford to lift from every recess of American life the dread fear of the unemployed that they are not needed in the world. We cannot afford to accumulate a deficit in the books of human fortitude.', 'In the place of the palace of privilege we seek to build a temple out of faith and hope and charity.', 'It is a sobering thing, my friends, to be a servant of this great cause. We try in our daily work to remember that the cause belongs not to us, but to the people. The standard is not in the hands of you and me alone. It is carried by America. We seek daily to profit from experience, to learn to do better as our task proceeds.', 'Governments can err, Presidents do make mistakes, but the immortal Dante tells us that divine justice weighs the sins of the cold-blooded and the sins of the warm-hearted in different scales.', 'Better the occasional faults of a Government that lives in a spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a Government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.', 'There is a mysterious cycle in human events. To some generations much is given. Of other generations much is expected. This generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny.', 'In this world of ours in other lands, there are some people, who, in times past, have lived and fought for freedom, and seem to have grown too weary to carry on the fight. They have sold their heritage of freedom for the illusion of a living. They have yielded their democracy.', 'I believe in my heart that only our success can stir their ancient hope. They begin to know that here in America we are waging a great and successful war. It is not alone a war against want and destitution and economic demoralization. It is more than that; it is a war for the survival of democracy. We are fighting to save a great and precious form of government for ourselves and for the world.', 'I accept the commission you have tendered me. I join with you. I am enlisted for the duration of the war.']",1
1,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"September 10, 1936","['Governor Ehringhaus, Mr. Mayor, my friends of Charlotte:', 'Notice that the rainbow shines in the sky; and it is a fitting climax to two of the most delightful days that I have ever spent in my life.', 'I am grateful, Governor Ehringhaus, for your hospitality; and may I, through you, thank the people of the Old North State for the welcome that they have given me?', 'I am told that this meeting is a Green Pastures Meeting. And the showers that we have passed through today prove that the pastures of North Carolina are green.', 'Green pastures! What a memory those words call forth! In all our schooling, in every part of the land, no matter to what church we happen to belong, the old Twenty-third Psalm is in all probability better known to men, women and children than any other poem in the English language.', 'And in this great lyric, what do we best remember? Two lines:', '""He maketh me to lie down in green pastures;', 'He leadeth me beside the still waters.""', 'It does not greatly matter whether that symbol of an ideal of human physical and spiritual happiness was written in its original three thousand or five thousand or ten thousand years ago. It might have been written as well in the twentieth century of the Christian era.', ""Have you ever stopped to think that happiness is most often described in terms of the simple ways of Nature rather than in the complex ways of man's fabrications? Perhaps it is because peace is necessary to ultimate happiness. Perhaps, therefore, when we seek a symbol of happiness, we do not go to the rush of crowded city streets or to the hum of machinery to find the simile."", ""The ancient psalmist did not use the parable of the merchants' camel train or the royal palace or the crowded bazaar of the East. He had, in his day, as we have today, the problems of competing trade and social crowding; and I venture to suggest that long before the Christian era, the ancient civilizations of the East were confronted with problems of social economics which, though small in point of human numbers and small in point of worldly goods, were still, by comparison, as potent in their effect and as difficult in their solution as the extraordinarily similar problems of social economics that face us in this country today."", 'Be it remembered then, that those kings and prophets reverted, just as we do today, to the good earth and the still waters when they idealized security of the body and mind.', 'A recent writer has suggested that the present President of the United States, perhaps because of where he was born and where he was trained and perhaps because of his natural proclivity, inevitably reverts to terms of land and water in his approach to any great public problem. I fear that I must plead guilty to this charge, though I do so with the reservation that this is in spite of the fact that during the greater part of my life I have been in far closer contact with the more exciting and more highly competitive give and take of the profession of the law, the practice of business and the exactions of public service.', 'Green pastures! Millions of our fellow Americans, with whom I have been associating in the past two weeks, out on the Great Plains of America, live with prayers and hopes for the fulfillment of what those words imply. Still waters! Millions of other Americans, with whom I also have been associated of late, live with prayers and hopes either that the floods may be stilled—floods that bring with them destruction and disaster to fields and flocks, to homesteads and cities—or else they look for the Heaven-sent rains that will fill their wells, their ponds and their peaceful streams.', 'Many years ago, I talked with a learned man about this continent-about what North America was like when the white man came. I asked him if the Great Plains, which extend hundreds and hundreds of miles from the Mississippi to the Rockies, were always bare of trees, always the pasturage of buffalo and antelope.', '""Yes,"" he replied. ""For many hundreds of years before the white man came, but it is my belief that trees could have grown and still could grow on those plains, but that they have been prevented from growing by the constant succession of prairie fires, set either by the lightning or the red men.""', 'I asked him whether the streams of the Southland were always brown and full of silt before our white ancestors moved in. ""No,"" he said, ""in those earlier days, during the greater part of the year, the Southern rivers were clear streams, except perhaps for a week or so in the springtime, when they had moderate freshets, small floods. When they occurred, some soil but very little soil was washed from the uplands, from the mountains of the South into the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf; but because these were seasonal only in their effect and small in volume, the natural accretion of new topsoil took the place of that which had run off to the sea.""', 'If history gives a name to the day and age in which we are living, I hope it will call this the era of rebuilding, for it is my firm conviction that unless we, in our generation, start to rebuild, the Americans of a century hence will have lost the greater part of their natural and national heritage.', 'My friends, it is because I have spent so much of these latter years in this Southland, and because l have come to know its fine people, its brave history, its many problems, that I speak not as a stranger to you who are gathered here from seven States.', 'I have seen the denuding of your forests; I have seen the washing away of your topsoil; I have slid into the ditch from your red clay highways. I have taken part in your splendid efforts to save your forests, to terrace your lands, to harness your streams and to push hard-surfaced roads into every county in every State. I have even assumed the amazing role of a columnist for a Georgia newspaper in order that I might write powerful pieces against burning over the farm woodlot and in favor of the cow, hog and hen program.', 'May I add that it is because of practical experience on my own farm, that many years before I was inaugurated President I came', 'to the conclusion that cotton, as it stood then, was essentially a speculative crop and that the planter of cotton, because he had nothing to say about the price he would receive, could never tell when he put the seed in the ground whether he would make a big profit by selling his crop for twenty-five cents a pound or go broke by selling his crop for five cents a pound.', 'It is perhaps a bit of history hitherto unrecorded that in the month of March, 1933, I said this to the Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Wallace. I said, ""In respect to cotton""—and I talked to him about lots of crops— ""I have a definite objective. The cotton farmer has been cursed for a generation by the fact of insecurity. The price for his crop has run up the scale and down the scale and up the scale and down the scale again. In recent years""-mind you, I was speaking in 1933—""in recent years his total aggregate production has been so great that thirteen million bales overhang the market. He will starve on five-cent cotton—the South will starve on five-cent cotton —and just as long as this appalling carryover hangs over the market, he will never get a price that will even bring him out whole. My objective, Mr. Secretary, is to control and reduce that unwieldy surplus; to get for the cotton planter ten-cent cotton the first year we are in office, and twelve-cent cotton or more for the next three years. You and I must keep that goal ever before us.""', 'And, my friends, I ask you in simple fairness, have we attained that goal?', 'You know the story of cotton. You know the story of tobacco, too. There again your national Government had a goal. I do not believe that the great tobacco-growing States of the Nation would wish to go back to the days of ""every man for himself and let the . devil take the hindmost.""', 'Again, long before I went to Washington, I was convinced that the long road that leads to green pastures and still waters had to begin with reasonable prosperity. It seemed axiomatic to me that a cotton farmer who could get only five cents a pound for his crop could not be in a position properly to fertilize his land, or to terrace it, or to rotate his crops, or to keep a cow or a few head of cattle, or to plant a little orchard, or to cultivate a garden—in other words, to work out for himself and his family a well-rounded, reasonably secure life that would tide him and them over a lean year of drought.', 'The same thing held true, I thought, in the case of the farmer whose principal crop was tobacco or whose principal crop was peaches or whose principal crop was corn or wheat or cattle or hogs.', 'In other words, we could not go ahead to the next step of prevention of soil erosion throughout the South and indeed throughout the Nation, to the transfer of thin pastures into forests and the transfer of submarginal plowed land into pastures and trees; we could not go ahead to the use of many modern methods to stop soil erosion and to prevent floods until and unless the farmers of the Southland were able to make a reasonably decent living out of their farms.', 'And what is the answer? Today, because of better prices for farm commodities, we are actually and actively engaged in taking these second steps. Not only have we aroused a public understanding and approval of the need of ending soil erosion and water run-off, but we have enabled the public, through a practical prosperity, to begin to pay their debts, to paint their homes, to buy farm tools and automobiles, to send more boys and girls through school and college, to put some money in the bank and, incidentally, to know for the first time that the money in the bank is safe.', 'So much for the green pastures and the still waters in their more literal physical terms. Those ancient words apply, however, with equal force to men and women and children. Your life and mine, though we work in the mill or in the office or in the store, can still be a life in green pastures and beside still waters.', 'No man, no woman, no family can hope in any part of the country to attain security in a city on starvation wages any more than they can hope on a farm to attain security on starvation crop prices. I do not have to tell you, who live in any of these Southern States, all of which have factories in them, that a family that tries to subsist on a total wage income of three or four hundred dollars a year is just as much a drag on the prosperity of America as the farm family that seeks to subsist on a yearly cash income of a hundred or two hundred dollars a year.', 'That is why a good many thinking people in finance and in business and in every other walk of life believe that the National Recovery Act, during its short term of life, accomplished as much for the restoration of prosperity, through the establishment of the minimum wage, the shortening of hours and the elimination of child labor, as any law put on the statute books of the Federal Government in the past century and a half.', 'In the summer of 1934, the head of one of the great mail-order houses said to me, ""Do you remember my telling you a year ago that the purchasing power of the South had dropped to almost zero? Look at this report of our sales in all the Southern States. All of our sales have increased, but those in the South have come back faster than any, and the reason is that the South at last has begun to acquire purchasing power.""', 'Finally, in this fourth year of definite upturn, you and I have come to appreciate another significant and inevitable result. You and I live under three kinds of government—and to all three we, as citizens, pay taxes. Our local real estate taxes, mainly on real estate, go to the support of local and state functions of government such as schools and highways, city and county administrations, water supply, sewer systems, street lighting, peace officers and State institutions. Our Federal taxes, none of which by the way is on real estate, come in the form of tobacco and similar excises, and income, inheritance, and corporation taxes and are spent in the running of the Federal Government for national defense, for pensions, for forests, for parks, for highways, for public works of all kinds and for relief of the unemployed.', 'Four years ago all of us, in every part of the United States, found that without any change in the local or State tax schedules, the tax receipts had fallen off to an alarming degree. The result was that counties and municipalities and States were failing to balance their budgets, or else were unable to carry out the ordinary and orderly functions and obligations of State and local government. Schools were being closed or curtailed; teachers were unpaid; roads lacked repairs; the borrowing of money for permanent improvements had become impossible. With the Federal Government, despite additional new forms of taxes in those days, receipts of revenue in 1932 had been cut in half.', 'The value of those tangible private assets on which taxes were based had fallen so low that even if the income had been there to pay taxes with, the sums received would have put all forms of government increasingly in the red. And even when some remnant of value remained on which to levy a tax, the taxpayer did not have the wherewithal to make the payment and was beginning to lose the very property which was taxed.', ""That is why I go back to the original thesis that any commonsense, logical governmental policy had to begin with the building up of farm and other property values, and crop values, and the increase of workers' wages if that now historic corner was ever to be turned."", 'History records that only a few years ago farmers were not making both ends meet; workers in factories were not making both ends meet; the small business man was not making both ends meet; and the corporation was not making both ends meet. As a logical result, local governments were not making both ends meet, and neither were State Governments, and neither was the National Government.', 'Incidentally, as another result in those days, the individual who had to borrow, the corporation which had to borrow and the Government which had to borrow—all of them were compelled to pay unconscionable and ruinous interest rates.', 'History will also record that by the year 1936 a very much larger number of individuals are back in the black; so are most of our small business men; so are most of our corporations and so are almost all of our municipal and county and State Governments.', 'History will also record that individuals and corporations and Governments are paying today a far more reasonable rate of interest than at any previous time in the history of the American Republic.', 'In the process of attaining these successful ends, my friends, individual liberties have not been removed, and I believe that the Governor of North Carolina and almost every other Governor in every one of the forty-eight States will agree that the inherent rights of the sovereign States have not been invaded. It was obvious, of course, because of the economic unity of the entire Nation in these modern days that no group of individuals and no individual States acting all alone could, by themselves, take the action necessary to restore the purchasing power of the United States as a whole. Only the Federal Government could ask and receive the cooperation of all the States in heading a nationwide plan.', ""I speak to you today as common-sense American men and women. You will agree that from the material aspect, based on the sound concept of restoring purchasing power and prosperity to the great mass of our citizens, this Nation's consuming power has been and is being rapidly restored. I trust, therefore, that you will likewise agree that better conditions on the farms, better conditions in the factories, better conditions in the homes of America are leading us to that beautiful spiritual figure of the old psalmist—green pastures and still waters.""]",1
2,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"October 01, 1936","['I am glad to come back to Fairmont and to note that it is a much more prosperous-looking community than the last time I was here.', 'I am glad to be here with Senator Neely and Governor Kump and your Congressman and also your next Governor.', 'I received a telegram a few moments ago on the train and through you good people I am going to make an announcement about it. The telegram reports that for the first time in fifty-five years we have completed one full year without a single national bank failure in the United States. From that, I am inclined to think that the banks of the United States are safer than they have been in fifty-five years.', 'I have been much interested in seeing that great dam that is under construction farther up-stream. The engineer in charge told me that in July and in August of this year there has been a greater tonnage of water-borne freight on the Monongahela River than on any other stream in the United States.', 'I am glad that the Federal Government is thus cooperating with the communities of this part of the country. I call it pretty successful cooperative boondoggling.', 'It is good to be with you and I hope to come back one of these days soon. Many thanks.']",1
3,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"October 01, 1936","['Mr. Chairman, Governor Earle, my friends of Pennsylvania:', 'A baseball park is a good place to talk about box scores. Tonight I am going to talk to you about the box score of the Government of the United States. I am going to tell you the story of our fight to beat down the depression and win recovery. From where I stand it looks as though the game is pretty well ""in the bag.""', 'I am convinced that when Government finance or any other kind of finance is honest, and when all the cards are on the table, 4 there is no higher mathematics about it. It is just plain, scoreboard arithmetic.', 'When the present management of your team took charge in 1933, the national scoreboard looked pretty bad. In fact, it looked so much like a shut-out for the team that you voted a change of management in order to give the country a chance to win the game. And today we are winning it.', 'When the new management came to Washington, we began to make our plans—plans to meet the immediate crisis and plans that would carry the people of the country back to decent prosperity.', 'You and I and everybody else saw the millions out of work, saw the business concerns running in the red, saw the banks closing. Our national income had declined over 50 percent—and, what was worse, it showed no prospect of recuperating by itself. By national income I mean the total of all income of all the 125,000,000 people in this country—the total of all the pay envelopes, all the farm sales, all the profits of all the businesses and all the individuals and corporations in America.', 'During the four lean years before this Administration took office, that national income had declined from eighty-one billions a year to thirty-eight billions a year. In short, you and I, all of us together, were making forty-three billions—spelled with a ""b,"" not an ""m""—forty-three billion dollars less in 1932 than we made in 1929.', 'Now, the rise and fall of national income—since they tell the story of how much you and I and everybody else are making-are an index of the rise and fall of national prosperity. They are also an index of the prosperity of your Government. The money to run the Government comes from taxes; and the tax revenue in turn depends for its size on the size of the national income. When the incomes and the values and transactions of the country are on the down-grade, then tax receipts go on the down-grade too. If the national income continues to decline, then the Government cannot run without going into the red. The only way to keep the Government out of the red is to keep the people out of the red. And so we had to balance the budget of the American people be-fore we could balance the budget of the national Government.', ""That makes common sense, doesn't it?"", 'The box score when the Democratic Administration came to bat in 1933 showed a net deficit in our national accounts of about $3,000,000,000, accumulated in the three previous years under my predecessor.', 'National income was in a downward spiral. Federal Government revenues were in a downward spiral. To pile on vast new taxes would get us nowhere because values were going down-and that makes sense too.', 'On top of having to meet the ordinary expenses of Government, I recognized the obligation of the Federal Government to feed and take care of the growing army of homeless and destitute unemployed.', 'Something had to be done. A national choice had to be made. We could do one of two things. Some people who sat across my desk in those days urged me to let Nature take its course and to continue a policy of doing nothing. I rejected that advice because Nature was in an angry mood.', 'To have accepted that advice would have meant the continued wiping out of people of small means—the continued loss of their homes and farms and small businesses into the hands of people who still had enough capital left to pick up those homes and farms and businesses at bankruptcy prices. It would have meant, in a very short time, the loss of all the resources of a multitude of individuals and families and small corporations. You would have seen, throughout the Nation, a concentration of property ownership in the hands of one or two percent of the population, a concentration unequaled in any great Nation since the days of the later Roman Empire.', 'And so the program of this Administration set out to protect the small business, the small corporation, the small shop, and the small individual from the wave of deflation that threatened them. We realized then, as we do now, that the vast army of small business men and factory owners and shop owners—together with our farmers and workers—form the backbone of the industrial life of America. In our long-range plan we recognized that the prosperity of America depended upon, and would continue to depend upon, the prosperity of them all.', 'I rejected the advice that was given to me to do nothing for an additional reason. I had promised, and my Administration was determined, to keep the people of the United States from starvation.', 'I refused to leave human needs solely in the hands of local communities—local communities which themselves were almost bankrupt.', 'To have accepted that advice would have been to offer breadlines again to the American people, knowing this time, however, that in many places the lines would last far longer than the bread. In those dark days, between us and a balanced budget stood millions of needy Americans, denied the promise of a decent American life.', 'To balance our budget in 1933 or 1934 or 1935 would have been a crime against the American people. To do so we should either have had to make a capital levy that would have been confiscatory, or we should have had to set our face against human suffering with callous indifference. When Americans suffered, we refused to pass by on the other side. Humanity came first.', 'No one lightly lays a burden on the income of a Nation. But this vicious tightening circle of our declining national income simply had to be broken. The bankers and the industrialists of the Nation cried aloud that private business was powerless to break it. They turned, as they had a right to turn, to the Government. We accepted the final responsibility of Government, after all else had failed, to spend money when no one else had money left to spend.', 'I adopted, therefore, the other alternative. I cast aside a do nothing or a wait-and-see policy.', 'As a first step in our program we had to stop the quick spiral of deflation and decline in the national income. Having stopped them, we went on to restore purchasing power, to raise values, to put people back to work, and to start the national income going up again.', 'In 1933 we reversed the policy of the previous Administration. For the first time since the depression you had a Congress and an Administration in Washington which had the courage to provide the necessary resources which private interests no longer had or no longer dared to risk.', 'This cost money. We knew, and you knew, in March, 1933, that it would cost money. We knew, and you knew, that it would cost money for several years to come. The people understood that in 1933. They understood it in 1934, when they gave the Administration a full endorsement of its policy. They knew in 1935, and they know in 1936, that the plan is working.', 'All right, my friends, let us look at the cost. Since we could not get the money by taxes we borrowed it, and increased the public debt.', ""President Hoover's Administration increased the national debt in the net amount of over three billion dollars in three depression years, and there was little to show for it. My Administration has increased the national debt in the net amount of about eight billion dollars and there is much to show for it."", 'Put that figure of eight billions out here on the scoreboard, and let me tell you where the dollars went.', ""Over a billion and a half went for payment of the World War Veterans' Bonus this year instead of in 1945. That payment is now out of the way, and is no longer a future obligation of the Government."", 'As for the other six and a half billions of the deficit we did not just spend money; we spent it for something. America got something for what we spent—conservation of human resources through C.C.C. camps and through work relief; conservation of natural resources of water, soil and forest; billions for security and a better life. While many who criticize today were selling America short, we were investing in the future of America.', 'Contrast those expenditures and what we got for them with certain other expenditures of the American people in the years between 1920 and 1930. During that period not merely eight billions but many more billions came out of American pockets and were sent abroad—to foreign countries where the money was used for increasing foreign armaments, for building foreign factories to compete with us, for building foreign dwellings, swimming pools, and slaughter houses, for giving employment to the foreign unemployed—foreign boondoggling, if you will.', 'Those dollars, billions of them, were just as good American money—just as hard-earned—just as much the reward of our thrift—as the dollars we have spent during these three years at home giving work to the unemployed. Most of those dollars sent abroad are gone for good. Those billions, lost to us under previous Administrations, do not, by the way, include the other billions loaned by the United States to foreign Governments during and immediately after the War.', 'I ask you the simple question: Has it not been a sounder investment for us during these past three years to spend eight billion dollars for American industry, American farms, American homes and the care of American citizens?', 'I have used the figure of eight billion dollars as representing the net increase in our national debt. Immediately people will rush into print or run to the microphone to tell you that my arithmetic is all wrong. They will tell you that the increase in the national debt is thirteen billions instead of eight. That is technically and morally just as correct as if someone were to try to scare you about the condition of your bank by telling you all about its liabilities and not telling you about its assets.', 'That is technically and morally just as correct as telling you good people here in Pennsylvania that none of your bank deposits or insurance policies is sound.', 'When you are told that the United States Treasury has thirteen billions more of liabilities than it had in 1933, you should also be told that it has six billion dollars of increased assets to set off against these liabilities.', ""In three years our net national debt has increased eight billions of dollars. But in two years of the recent war it increased as much as twenty-five billion dollars. National defense and the future of America were involved in 1917. National defense and the future of America were also involved in 1933. Don't you believe that the saving of America has been cheap at that price? It was more than defense—it was more than rescue. It was an investment in the future of America."", 'And, incidentally, tonight is an anniversary in the affairs of our Government which I wish to celebrate with you and the American people. It is October first, and it marks the end of a whole year in which there has been not a single national bank failure in all the United States. It has been fifty-five years since that kind of record has been established. You and I can take this occasion to rejoice in that record. It is proof that the program has worked.', 'Compare the scoreboard which you have in Pittsburgh now with the scoreboard which you had when I stood here at second base in this field four years ago. At that time, as I drove through these great valleys, I could see mile after mile of this greatest mill and factory area in the world, a dead panorama of silent black structures and smokeless stacks. I saw idleness and hunger instead of the whirl of machinery. Today as I came north from West Virginia, I saw mines operating, I found bustle and life, the hiss of steam, the ring of steel on steel—the roaring song of industry.', 'And now a word as to this foolish fear about the crushing load the debt will impose upon your children and mine. This debt is not going to be paid by oppressive taxation on future generations. It is not going to be paid by taking away the hard-won savings of the present generation.', 'It is going to be paid out of an increased national income and increased individual incomes produced by increasing national prosperity.', 'The deficit of the national Government has been steadily declining for three years running, although technically this year it did not decline, because we paid the Bonus this year instead of 1945. Without the Bonus the deficit would have declined this year also.', 'The truth is that we are doing better than we anticipated in 1933. The national income has gone up faster than we dared then to hope. Deficits have been less than we expected. Treasury receipts are increasing. The national debt today in relation to the national income is much less than it was in 1933, when this Administration took office.', 'The national income was thirty-eight billions in 1932. In 1935 it was fifty-three billions and this year it will be well over sixty billions. If it keeps on rising at the present rate, as I am confident that it will, the receipts of the Government, without imposing any additional taxes, will, within a year or two, be sufficient to care for all ordinary and relief expenses of the Government—in other words, to balance the budget.', 'The Government of this great Nation, solvent, sound in credit, is coming through a crisis as grave as war without having sacrificed American democracy or the ideals of American life.']",1

I planned it with a very great citizen of this State and of this city, and I am only sorry he cannot be with us today.', 'Louis Murphy was a great and kind man, a close friend of mine. Instead of talking politics, I want to read to you a few sentences from a very wonderful tribute which was paid to Louis Murphy at the time of his funeral here. I want to read them to you because these words are not political, and yet they are concerned with better government all over the United States.', 'In this tribute Father Sheehy said this about the late Senator:', '""When Senator Murphy was vested with the responsibilities of his high office, millions were subject to varying degrees of privation and want. Drastic measures were necessary, and perhaps some of them, as the late Senator himself admitted, may have been unwise. But he could not stand idly by and do nothing.', '""The people of Iowa in electing Senator Murphy to the Senate vested him with the responsibility of championing a new social order in which class and privilege would be abolished. Four years of devastating want had all but extinguished the sacred fire of hope in their hearts. Senator Murphy was determined that the young people of this generation might be allowed to live normal, self-respecting lives. He voted for every relief measure, but he knew that the bread of charity was bitter bread and he was concerned that the problem of unemployment should be solved. He had no sympathy for those who would destroy private property. He knew that all rights are human rights. He did not wish to destroy the savings of the industrious and the more fortunate; yet he rejected both in theory and in practice irresponsible individualism.', '""To him social justice meant primarily that the common good must, particularly in such times as these, take precedence over personal gain. He was determined that no one should starve in this land of plenty. He fought with all his powers to keep a balance between the prices of farm produce and those of products of city workers.', '""In his struggle for what he thought right, Senator Murphy kept a cool, detached mind, ignoring the swarming tribe of rabble-rousers who today make both our hearts and our ears ache.""', 'And so, the spirit of Louis Murphy will long hover over the City of Dubuque and the State of Iowa.', 'It seems to me, my friends, that there is a great moral lesson in what I have read; there is a great lesson which points the direction toward which our country must go.', 'I am out here on what I suppose some people will consider a political trip. Nevertheless, I am primarily concerned about the future of the country; we all are. I am trying to gain better firsthand information as to the needs of the country in the days to come. It will be useful to me, whether I am reelected or not. I am merely one comparatively small unit among those concerned in the future of the country. Its future lies, today and in the days to come, in the hands of you good men and women, especially young people; and I am not worried so long as its conduct remains in your hands.', 'Now, I am going to look at some projects.']",1

I have never been in this part of the State before, and it was about time for me to come here.', 'You know, I find it terribly hard after four years to start in making political speeches again. One reason is that for the last four years I have been so engrossed in trying to bring things back, and that goes far beyond the mere lines of party politics.', 'There is one mighty nice thing about these trips, and that is that, so far as I can tell in going along the railroad, the expressions on the faces of the railroad men make me know that they are now all right. After all, we are all tied in together economically, and that is the lesson I am preaching. We shall not have successful railroads, we shall not have more employment on the railroads, unless the farmers are prosperous; and the farmers cannot be prosperous unless the city dwellers have enough money and enough work to buy what the farmers produce.', 'And so it goes all the way through the whole scale of human endeavor. The small merchants cannot sell their goods either to the farm population or to the city population unless there is buying power. What we have been trying to do in the past four years, from the point of view of economics, has had a comparatively simple objective—getting people work and producing buying power for them.', 'As I go through the country this year, in comparison with 1932, I see an enormous difference—an enormous difference in the prosperity of the country as a whole and in every part of it that I have visited.', 'I am not making one kind of speech in the East and another kind of speech in the West. I am not making one kind of speech to farm people and another kind of speech to industrial workers. In the last four years we have gained a great knowledge of the interdependence of every part of the Nation with every other part. If the men and women who work in clothing factories in the City of New York are out of a job, they do not buy so much pork. That kind of example goes for every known product of the land.', 'I am especially glad that the railroads are getting back on their feet again. Of course the Government has had some share in getting them back on their feet again. We loaned them a lot of money, and they are repaying it. It was a good investment. In just the same way, the Government has helped to get the banks back on their feet; we loaned them some money, and it was a good investment.', ""And so my friends- this is not a prepared speech—I just want to talk to you as one neighbor to another. I don't pretend to be a farmer; I happen to be by profession a lawyer. But I have farmed the best part of my life, up on the Hudson River and down in the State of Georgia, so I do know about some of the problems of agriculture in the United States. Every day that I go through this country I try to learn more about it; and that is going to stand me in good stead whether or not I go back to the White House for the next four years. And, incidentally, I get a tremendous kick out of it."", 'It is good to see you all.']",1

I hope in the next three or four years to come through by automobile and get a better idea of this country.', 'One of the things we ought to think a lot about in this campaign is what has happened to our national point of view in the last four years. In every section of the United States we have gained the understanding that prosperity in one section of the country is absolutely tied in with prosperity in all the other sections. Even back in the Eastern States and cities, they are beginning to realize that the purchasing power of the farmers of the Northwest will have a big effect on the prosperity of the industry and of the industrial workers of the East. In just the same way, I know you realize that if the factories in the big industrial cities are running full speed, people will have more money to buy the foodstuffs you raise.', 'I am told by the experts- and it is an interesting fact—that if every family in the United States lived on what might be called a class-A diet, that is the kind of diet that the doctors and dietitians would like us all to have for our own good and our own health, we would have to put 40,000,000 acres more land into production of foodstuffs.', 'In the last analysis, it comes down to the question of purchasing power. And we have raised the purchasing power in this country from about thirty-eight billion dollars in 1932 to over sixty billion dollars this year. And we have not stopped yet.', 'It is good to see you all. (A telephone wire was being strung into the train at that moment.) You know, one of the interesting things about trying to campaign and be President at the same time is that in almost every station we come to, there is a telephone message from Washington, and they string a wire through a car window and somebody talks directly from the train with one of the Government Departments, perhaps with the Treasury Department in relation to the stabilization of foreign exchange, or with the State Department in relation to what is going on, perhaps, in far distant lands. Here I am, pretty nearly in the center of the country, and yet I can keep in touch with the Government in Washington almost every hour of the day or night.', '(Audience: Are we going to fight?)', 'I hope we will never fight again as long as you and I are alive. The interesting thing is that while affairs are in pretty dangerous condition in Europe and in other parts of the world, this good-neighbor policy that we have established pretty satisfactorily in this hemisphere, not only with Canada on the north but with all the Republics on the south, seems to be catching hold among the people themselves in other parts of the world. If in the long run the people themselves get it, then those who rule those countries must get it too. So I believe that our foreign policy is really making for peace throughout the world.', 'Good-bye and good luck.']",1

The untimely death of the Secretary of War kept me away. It was at that time also that this State suffered a very great loss in the passing of a virile, magnetic and liberal American leader, Floyd Olson. He had been my friend for many years. I miss him greatly today.', ""Much water has run over the dam since those days in 1932 when, as Governor of New York, I was the guest of Governor Olson in this very building, the day that he presided at a great gathering in this city. During these more than four years, one of our most important national achievements has been the strides that we have made everywhere in thinking in national terms. And if I remember it, sitting in Governor Olson's office with him, occupying at his insistence his Governor's chair, that was what we were talking about in those days—making America safe in national terms. As a result of those four years America has never been so united as it is today."", 'In Iowa and in southern Minnesota on one or two occasions I have used the example that the great industrial centers of the East have come to realize that their prosperity is dependent on the prosperity of the farmers of the West. We have come to understand that the agricultural prosperity of the Northwest is directly affected also by the agricultural prosperity and the city prosperity of all the rest of the country. I have farms—two of them—one in New York and the other in Georgia. Georgia will buy Minnesota flour if Georgia gets a decent price for its cotton. Minnesota will buy overalls made of Georgia cotton if Minnesota gets a decent price for its wheat.', 'People in the manufacturing cities will find more employment at better wages if the farm families of the Nation have the wherewithal to purchase manufactured goods. And the farmers of the Nation will sell larger crops at better prices if the industrial workers in the cities have more money to buy dairy products, vegetables, fruit, pork and beef.', 'These are lessons, national lessons, that seem very obvious to us today, and yet it is not so very long ago that we had no policy at all about them.', 'In our local and sectional relationships also- relationships between the different farm regions and between city and country-we have in these four years come to recognize the closeness of the interdependence and the usefulness of the cooperative ideal.', 'Minnesota is a good place to talk about farm cooperatives. Here dairy and live-stock farmers have pioneered and pointed the way. Here and in Wisconsin have been built the greatest cooperative organizations in the Nation for processing and marketing dairy products.', 'When three and a half years ago the Administration undertook to meet the desperate and long-neglected needs of agriculture, we turned to the cooperative idea, and called to Washington representatives of the great cooperatives and other farm organizations to work out a program with us.', ""The Triple A itself had as its foundation and its essence the cooperative idea. Administered locally by community committees selected by the farmers themselves, it was a picture of economic democracy in action. I pay my tribute—with the rest of the Nation- to the patriotic zeal of the committees of farmers who did so much through their earnest cooperation for our adjustment and conservation program. The farmers of America will not forget what' they have done, and what they are doing."", 'This Administration, from the very start, came to the support of the cooperative ideal by vigorous action. That support has continued. That support will continue.', 'It established a central bank for cooperatives with twelve regional banks to aid in marketing and purchasing.', 'It held out the helping hand of credit to production credit associations to enable farmers to finance production through their own banks.', 'The Triple A worked directly with the cooperatives in their marketing agreement program. By loans to cooperatives we helped to bring the comforts of electricity to many farms of the Nation.', 'We did not stop at merely lending money. When farm prices were threatened, the Administration held them up by purchasing surplus products through farm cooperatives for distribution to hundreds of thousands of families faced with hunger in our great cities.', 'Nevertheless, while the Federal Government can help through its resources—and you know the many ways in which we have used national resources to help localities—we in Washington have recognized that cooperation and cooperatives must come from the people themselves. Government can see to it that the rules of the game are fair as between cooperative enterprise and other enterprise. But the initiative, the management itself, must spring and carry on from the bottom up, rather than from the top down.', 'This Administration is determined to continue in active support of the ever-growing farm cooperative movement.', 'I am happy in the strengthening of this movement at home. But, my friends, let us remember that the same spirit of cooperation is an essential part of our relations with the other Nations of the world. It is this realistic factual appreciation of the benefits of cooperation that lies behind our consistent and successful efforts to reestablish foreign markets for our farm products.', 'You will remember back three and a half years ago, in the spring of 1933, our American foreign trade had fallen off to about a third of its former value. That was what I inherited.', 'Let us go back to fundamentals once more. The very word ""trade"" means articles of commerce flowing in two directions. It is not a one-way street. At last we have come to understand this in our domestic trade within our own borders. For instance, no single State can produce either crops or merchandise and continue indefinitely to sell them to other States for money alone. Eventually, they have to be paid for in other products as well.', 'Foreign trade is just like that. There cannot be a revival of foreign exports without a revival of foreign imports—unless, of course, we do as we did between 1920 and 1930 —lend our money to foreign Nations to enable them to buy our own farm and industrial products.', 'But I have a suspicion that America has learned her lesson once and for all about that kind of frenzied finance.', 'The Secretary of State of the United States has spoken in Minnesota clearly and unequivocally in regard to the trade agreements that have been made with fourteen foreign countries for mutual trade advantage. He pointed out to you the chapter and verse of the statistical record which shows what these agreements have accomplished to increase the trade and income not only of the industrial workers, but of the farmers of the Nation. It was not a question of winning or losing any treaty. Mutual advantage has been the successful objective; and our exports during the first half of this year, as compared with last year, have increased by one hundred and thirty-two million dollars.', 'To Canada, our neighbor on the north, the twenty-four million dollars of our increased exports during the first six months have included exports not only of manufactured articles but also of agricultural products. American industry and American agriculture are both benefiting by increased general trade. The figures prove it; and our growing consumption and better farm prices prove it.', 'I wish every American—city dweller and farmer alike- could fasten this home truth in his memory: When the Nations of the world, including America, had jacked their tariffs to the highest point and enacted embargoes and imposed quotas, farm prices throughout the world were at their lowest, and world trade had almost ceased to exist.', 'Today, under the leadership of the United States, other Nations of the world are coming to recognize that home truth. Back in 1932, although there was a tariff on wheat of forty-two cents a bushel, you all know that the wheat which you produced up here in the Northwest was selling as low as thirty cents a bushel. There were no farm imports then to worry about; but low prices were plenty to worry about.', 'Within the past two weeks splendid progress has been made in giving a greater stability to foreign exchange. Within that same time there have been lifted many quotas and embargoes including those on important American agricultural export products.', 'But, my friends, the increasing restoration of trade, the increase in industry, the increase in employment—they all serve more than a mere economic end. For three years we have had faith that it would turn us and other Nations away from the paths of economic strife which lead to war and toward economic cooperation which leads to international peace.', 'Peace cannot be attained in this old world of ours just by getting sentimental about it. Peace depends upon the acceptance of the principle and practice of the good neighbor. That practice is founded on the Golden Rule, and must be fortified by cooperation of every kind between Nations.', 'Peace makes money; peace saves money for everybody. A prosperous world has no permanent room in it for dictatorship or for war. In striving for peace, I am confident that the American people seek it with their hearts and with their heads as well. Enlightened self-interest is justification for what we do.', 'Confident in the practical wisdom of the ends we seek, with full faith that it will serve in a practical way for peace on earth and good-will between men and Nations, we shall continue on our way.']",1
9,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"October 10, 1936","['I am glad to get into this section of the State. I understand that you good people were pretty hard hit by the drought this year. As you know, I have been going around the United States trying to get first-hand information in regard to drought conditions and a lot of other conditions.', 'I am glad to come here for another reason. I understand that Henry Wallace was born about fourteen miles from here.', 'Down in Washington we have never had a Secretary of Agriculture, certainly not in our generation, who has understood farm problems as well as Henry Wallace, and who has tied them into the national economy as well as he has.', 'Creston is a pretty good example of what I mean when I speak about national economy. There are a lot of railroad men in this town; and there are more jobs on the railroads. The railroads of the country are picking up. We have helped them with Federal loans, which, by the way, they are paying back, but their prosperity is caused more by the fact that a greater volume of goods is moving over the tracks. That involves national economy in the best sense. It means more food products, more manufactured products, and, most important of all and behind it all, more purchasing power. Looking at you people, I should say that, in spite of the drought, you have more purchasing power than you had in 1932.', 'At the very beginning of my Administration the Federal Government undertook to help in raising purchasing power. Yes, we incurred a deficit in doing it, but I shall put it to you this way: Suppose I were to say to anybody in this crowd, ""If you, by borrowing $800, could increase your annual income $2,200 every year, would you do it?"" Well, that, in effect, is what happened in this country. We increased the national debt a net of a little less than eight billion dollars but we increased the annual national income over twenty-two billion dollars.', 'Of course, in a campaign, all kinds of figures are presented, but most of them are presented by people who have never read the budget of the United States Government. And you can take my word for it—as one who has read .it a great many times—and it is bigger than a Sears Roebuck catalogue- that what I am telling you is strictly according to the figures.', 'I am glad to have been here. I wish I could get out and drive around and see conditions. As you know, we are using every means at the disposal of the Federal Government to prevent droughts as serious in the future. We cannot regulate the weather altogether, but we are cooperating with the different States and the local governments in trying to prevent future droughts from being as disastrous as they are today.']",1

It is a problem which is going to be solved for one very good reason, and that is that the people of the United States know more about government today than they did four years ago.', 'I realize, of course, that you have had a drought in this part of Iowa, a pretty severe drought. You know the steps we are taking in cooperation with the local and State Governments to remedy these drought conditions, and so to order things that, while we shall have droughts again, their effects, in the future, will not be so serious as they have been this year.', 'Yet, at the same time, we know that there can be conditions which are the exact opposite of drought— the possibility of piling up surpluses of agricultural products such as we were faced with when I first went to Washington. We all know the results of those surpluses as well as we know the results of droughts. What we are trying to do is to bring about a balanced system of economy in the United States, and I believe that the people all over realize that no one section of the country can be prosperous unless the other sections of the country are also prosperous.', 'The city dwellers have to have money to buy food and more food. Last year, somebody in the Department of Agriculture, in cooperation with a lot of expert doctors and dietitians, made a survey of what the people of the United States eat. Then they classified as Class A, the diet that we all ought to have. Diet B was graded as a pretty good diet but not the best. And they found that, as a Nation, we are living today in the United States, on the average, on Diet C. That is the actual fact.', 'Why is it? It is because people have not the purchasing power for either a B-diet or an A-diet. Incidentally, if all of us had the proper kind of diet in the United States, we would have to put 40,000,000 acres more land into the production of foodstuffs.', 'In these past three and a half years it has been a tremendously interesting experience to go around the United States and survey agricultural problems. We have made some real strides, but we have not gone far enough yet. We are going further along the lines we have laid down already, and, at the same time, we are going to work on new things.', ""Somebody in this campaign said something about a farm policy that changes its model every year. Well, isn't the automobile better than it was twenty years ago? It is the same principle. Every year they get .out a model that is a little better than it was twenty years ago. And so, while Model-T farming may have been all right ten years ago, we have got away from it and we now have a model 1936 farming."", 'It is mighty good to see you.

As you know, we are doing all we can by the principle of cooperation between local government and State Government and Washington to improve drought conditions all through this area from here west. I think we are getting somewhere.', ""Of course there are all kinds of campaign stories going around to which the average citizen with a little common sense does not pay much attention. Just for example, we got a telegram on the train this morning from a certain section of the country that there are a lot of people going around to people's homes saying that, if I get reelected, the debt of the United States is going to be liquidated by levying a tax on everybody's home and farm in the United States. That is a pretty good idea of what some people are reduced to. And yet, you know it is an interesting fact that there are still some people in this country who do not know that taxes on real estate are levied only for local and State purposes. In fact, in most States they are levied for local purposes only."", 'We have been learning a lot in the last four years about government. Just so long as we keep on taking an interest in government, I am not much worried about the future of the democratic form of government under our Constitution.', 'You hear a lot about debts. Well, a little farther up the road I put a question to a big crowd. \'We have borrowed eight billion dollars more than we owed four years ago and here is the question: Suppose somebody came to you and said: ""If you will borrow eight hundred dollars, it will increase your income every year by more than twenty-two hundred dollars,"" would you do it or not?', 'Well, all you have to do to get a picture of American national finance is just to add a whole lot of zeros to those figures. In other words, we have gone into debt a little less than eight billion dollars net, but our annual income today is over twenty-two billion dollars more than it was in 1932. I call that a pretty good investment.', 'I am looking forward to coming out here again during the next four years.

It is so long since I have been in this capital city of the State, that this wonderful structure that I face had not then even been started.', 'I have seen—in fact all the people of America have seen—photographs of this wonderful capitol building. Every one of them ought to come here and see it—a great structure, worthy of a great State.', 'I am not here to deliver a formal, carefully prepared address to you. I want to talk to you for a few minutes just as one of your fellow Americans who has great privileges. One of the privileges which I have in abundance is that of getting to know the United States. I suppose that I have been not once but a good many times in every State in the Union. One of the great lessons of the last three and a half or four years is the need of our thinking in national terms, because we have come to realize that anything that harms one State harms all the States. And back in the East, back in the great industrial centers, they have at last come to realize that they cannot be prosperous there unless you people are prosperous out here.', 'That has been one of the cardinal impulses that has directed all of our program during these past three years in Washington —the thought that we had to help everybody and not just a few people here and there. And as I have come west over the railroads, I no longer see the long trains of empty cars on the sidings. I see engines, that had been laid aside in 1929 for lack of use, being brought out of the shops, put on the tracks, and started down the rails with a string of freight cars behind them.', 'Why is that? It is because the freight cars have something to haul. And the reason the freight cars have something to haul is because people have money to buy things with—that is pretty obvious. The national income of the United States this year will have risen from about thirty-eight billion dollars in 1932 to well over sixty billions in 1936. In other words, it seems to me like a fairly simple mathematical question to put to you. If somebody that you trusted were to come to you and say, ""Look here, will you borrow $800 so as to get an increase in your annual income of $2,200?"" would you do it or not?', 'That is what has happened to our national finances. All you have to do is to add a lot of zeros to those figures. We have borrowed a net of eight billion dollars more in these three and a half years, and we have increased the national income over twenty-two billion dollars- and that is a pretty good investment.', 'You know, during a campaign I always like to have a few days in between trips, so that I can sit quietly for an hour or two or perhaps go to bed and, before I turn out the light, read some of the things that the other fellows are saying.', 'I got a telegram this morning on the train from a woman in Nebraska who was complaining that people are going up and down through this State, going to farms and going to homes, and saying to the families in those farms and homes: ""If this man Roosevelt should go back into the White House, what will he do? Why, he will slap some kind of tax on your home and your farm and take it away from you to pay the national debt.""', 'Now, my friends, I believe in this motto right in front of me on the capitol—""The Salvation of the State is Watchfulness in the Citizens."" For the last three and a half years the citizens of this country have developed a watchfulness and an understanding greater than they have ever had before; and because of that they are going to be able to distinguish the true from the false in this election.', 'Of course most people—I will not say everybody, but give us a few more years and it will be everybody— most people understand that taxes on real estate are levied in great part for the benefit of local government, and in some States in small part for the maintenance of State Government. There never has been, and there never will be, a Federal tax on farms or homes, as long as I have anything to do about it.', 'Yes, I get a lot of amusement—I was going to say a big kick-out of this campaign.', 'Somebody, talking about the national farm program of the last three and a half years —which, by the way, is operated in conjunction with the State Governments, the State colleges and the local county committees right down to the individual farmer—said that it was just like an automobile: its model was changed every year.', 'Well, I accept that simile; it is good. In other words, the automobile, like farming, improves through the years, and the policy relating to the automobile and the policy relating to farming ought to have a new model every year. I want to express to you my belief that the Model-T type of farming may have been all right between 1920 and 1930, but it is out of date today.', 'Of course, as you know, the Federal Government, working with the local governments, has made possible the saving of homes, and the saving of farms. You know also that the great bulk of all that money that was loaned is going to come back to the Treasury. In the same way because it is all part of the same picture, the money we have loaned to keep the railroads going until the production and consuming power of the country could catch up is also being repaid. The money we loaned to keep the banks open—and, by the way, for the first time in fifty-five years, there has not been for this whole year a national bank failure in all the United States— that money, that saved the banks, is coming back to the Treasury.', 'Some money was not merely loaned. That is true. Some money was spent to keep a good many million families from starving in these three and a half years—to give people work instead of a dole. I believe in work and not in a dole. That money was spent in a good cause, and, as one of my high-class business friends from New York remarked to me the other day, ""If there were as little waste by corporations in spending a sum like that as there has been in the Federal expenditure of that money, there would be fewer bankrupt corporations in the United States today.""', 'It comes back to your motto: ""The Salvation of the State is Watchfulness in the Citizens."" Read, learn, mark, and inwardly digest—and ""inwardly digest"" means separating the wheat from the chaff of a national campaign.', 'I believe—I know—that the American people know how to separate the wheat from the chaff, and that is why I am confident of their verdict on the third day of November.']",1

I hope that this word will be heard by the citizens of the other forty-seven States, because I know that what I am going to say represents the conviction of the great majority of those who are devoted to good government, clean government, representative government.', 'On this platform sits a man whose reputation for many years has been known in every community—a man old in years but young in heart—a man who through all these years has had no boss but his own conscience—the Senior Senator from the State of Nebraska, given to the Nation by the people of Nebraska—George W. Norris.', 'Outside of my own State of New York, I have consistently refrained from taking part in elections in any other State.', ""But Senator Norris' name has been entered as a candidate for Senator from Nebraska. And to my rule of non-participation in State elections I have made- and so long as he lives I always will make- one magnificently justified exception."", ""George Norris' candidacy transcends State and party lines. In our national history we have had few elder statesmen who like him have preserved the aspirations of youth as they accumulated the wisdom of years. He is one of the major prophets of America."", 'Help this great American to continue an historic career of service.', 'Nebraska will be doing a great service not only to itself, but to every other State in the Union and to the Nation as a whole, if it places this great American above partisanship, and keeps George Norris in the Senate of the United States.', ""I want to take you back four years, to 1932. In that year, when I was a candidate for the Presidency, I pledged my Administration to a farm policy that would help the farmer. Tonight every man and woman on an American farm, east or west, who has read today's market reports knows that we have done what we said we would do."", 'What needed to be done?', 'You remember that in March, 1933, after twelve lean years, farm income was disappearing and farm prices had sunk to a bankruptcy level.', ""In 1932 America's farm population was the greatest in our history, and yet the farmers' income was the lowest for the quarter century for which we have records. Farmers represented 25 percent of the Nation's population—but they got only 7 1/2 percent of the national income."", ""The spectre of foreclosure stalked the farmer's plow."", 'American agriculture was on the road to pauperism.', 'When the World War ended, the Nations of Europe whom we had been feeding went back to farming for themselves. Our farmers were left holding the bag— a bag that bulged with vast quantities of wheat and corn and cotton for which the market had disappeared.', ""That was the farmer's plight. What did Republican leadership do about it?"", 'The best that it could offer was the Farm Board, a contraption that set an all-time high for extravagant futility. It met the problem of unsalable and unexplorable surpluses by piling up bigger surpluses.', 'To finish the job, the Republican Smoot-Hawley tariff robbed the farmer of his last chance for a foreign market.', ""We found that this conspicuous failure of Government to help the farmer had created—by March 4, 1933— a state of mind in the Nation which, itself, seemed to bar the way out for the farmer's difficulties. There was a defeatist attitude- a conviction that the farmer could not be helped, that all efforts were foredoomed to failure, that any party which dared to substitute action for talk would get its political fingers burned."", 'Along with this defeatism there was the belief that money spent on the farm problem was money wasted—that the only excuse for spending it was to keep the farmer in line—to buy political peace.', 'That was what had happened to American agriculture when this Administration came into office.', 'That was the debris of twelve years of failure which we had to clear away before we could begin to lay the basis for a permanent agricultural prosperity.', 'Tonight you know that the ground has been cleared of that debris. After twelve years in which he has been harassed and weighed down by the burdens of each succeeding day, the farmer at last has begun to get into the clear, so that he can begin again to take thought for tomorrow.', 'Back of what we did was the conviction that the agricultural problem is not a problem for the farmer alone—that it is a problem for the Nation as a whole. That is the way we attacked it.', 'And the Nation is now going along with the farmer. Now for the first time in this industrial period of our history, the American people understand that there is a definite bond between agriculture and industry, that the money we have used for the restoration of American agriculture has been an investment in the restoration of American industry, an underwriting for the wages of American labor, a stimulus for profits in American business.', 'The defeatist attitude has at last itself been defeated.', 'Back of what we did was a second conviction—that a sound farm policy must be a policy run by farmers. Ours is that kind of policy. The farmers of America moved into the Department of Agriculture on the day that Henry Wallace set up shop there. For the very first time, a national farm program was made in conference with, and with the agreement of, the farm leaders of all our farm organizations—a program which came out of the free and open councils of farmers rather than out of the vote-catching schemes of politicians.', 'With these convictions, this Administration put its hand to the plow. It has not turned, it will not turn, back.', 'I am going to tell you in just seven sentences what we have done. Every man and woman on an American farm can expand these seven sentences in terms of the recovery that has come to each of them in the last three and a half years.', ""First, by our Agricultural Adjustment Act, our monetary policy, our soil conservation program, and our assistance to farm cooperatives, we have raised the farmers' net annual income by three and a half billion dollars to a sum three times what it was in 1932."", ""Second, through the Farm Credit Administration we have saved thousands of homes and farms from foreclosure and have reduced the staggering burden of the farmers' debts."", ""Third, through reciprocal trade treaties and international currency stabilization, we have begun to recover the farmers' foreign markets in the only way in which they can be recovered and held—by a policy of mutual international advantage which today is bearing fruit in the reopening of markets for American farm products in all of the fourteen countries making these agreements—by a policy which, for example, within the last ten days has brought about lower tariffs in France, Italy and Switzerland for the benefit of our farmers. And, my friends, a growing trade is making for international peace."", ""Fourth, by our program to revive business, to increase employment, to raise business and professional incomes and the wages of labor, and to increase the purchasing power and consumption of the average American family, we have restored national income, and prepared the way for the steady and longtime expansion of the farmers' home market."", 'Fifth, by our program of land use and conservation we have ended the policy of immediate glut and eventual waste, and have laid the basis for a permanent plenty.', 'Sixth, by our program of rural electrification, by our farm-to-market roads, by our aid to rural schools, we have begun to get for the farmer his fair share in the comforts, the advantages, the wider interests and the deeper satisfactions which go to make the good life for himself and for his children.', 'And seventh, when disastrous drought struck the land in many parts of our country, we rushed immediate and direct relief to the farmers and stockmen to save them from want—a policy that some people call waste, but that you and I call wise.', ""There is the record. In those seven sentences, the farmer and the farmer's family can measure for themselves the vast difference between the desperation which was theirs in the spring of 1933 and the recovery which is theirs in 1936. From what that record has done and is doing for you, judge for yourselves our determination and our capacity to carry this program through."", 'After having neglected a twelve-year opportunity for help to the American farmer, as his condition got worse and worse, what does Republican leadership now offer?', 'First of all, it would scrap the present program, which it has condemned as a""subterfuge"" and a ""stop-gap."" It would junk the farmers\' organization to carry it out. It would end the farmers\' program of cooperation, and send them back to the ""free competition""—or ""rugged individualism"" if you will—that wrecked them in 1932.', 'Next, it would substitute a system of tariff equivalent payments, not for any permanent contribution to farm wealth or national income, but merely as a cash hand-out—in other words, a dole. These payments, under their plan, would be made only to the producers of exportable farm crops—specifically hogs, wheat, cotton and tobacco. Dairymen, cattlemen, sugar growers and producers of other varieties of crops of which there normally is no exportable surplus would be left out.', 'What about the effect of such a scheme? Would it serve to protect farmers from price collapse under a burden of surpluses? Would it guard them in the future against a disaster like 1932?', 'No plan could lead the Nation back faster to such a crisis.', 'The proposed plan of the Republican leaders is a straight subsidy of unlimited farm production. In a year or two of normal weather, it would pile surplus on top of surplus, driving prices down and down and down. It is the Federal Farm Board all over again, and it means nine cents for corn again as it did in 1932.', 'Finally, to make the parallel with 1932 letter perfect, the Republican leaders now propose to repeal the Reciprocal Tariff Act, and go back to the old Smoot-Hawley tariff policy. Once again, as in 1932, the farmers would have price-crushing surpluses at home, and no place abroad to sell them.', 'What about the cost? It would run to one and a half and possibly even two billion dollars every year. This vast sum would be spent not to save agriculture, but to wreck it and with it to wreck the Nation.', 'Either this plan which they advocate in the West, or the curtailment of expenditures which they talk about in the East, would have to be discarded. Both promises cannot possibly be carried out at the same time.', 'For the first time in many cruel years, we are getting the problem of the business of farming well in hand. Do you now want to turn that problem over to the care of those who did nothing about it in the past? Do you want to turn it over to those who now make inconsistent, campaign-devised, half-baked promises which you and they know they cannot keep?', ""It has been said that the Administration's farm program changes each year like new models of automobiles. I accept that simile. The automobile of today is the same kind of vehicle, in principle, as it was twenty years ago. But because the automobile manufacturer did not hesitate to pioneer, because he was willing to make yearly changes in his model, the Nation now drives a car that is vastly improved. Farming, too, is the same in principle now as it has always been. But because the farmer has been willing to pioneer, because, with the aid of scientists, economists and engineers he has been willing, year after year, to change, because of these things both the product of the farms and the business of farming have been vastly improved. It is the aim of our policy not only to prevent the return of yesterday's model, but to make tomorrow's model better than today's. Good as it was in the old days, we have passed beyond Model-T farming."", 'Our long-time policy of prudence and farm progress includes a program of conservation against land wastage and soil impoverishment. From the beginning, such a program has been basic in our plans. On October 25, 1935, months before the action of the Supreme Court on the Triple A, I said publicly that it was the intention of the framers of that Act as it was my intention ""to pass from the purely emergency phases necessitated by a grave national crisis to a long-time more permanent plan for American agriculture.""', ""We knew that our soil had been recklessly impoverished by crops which did not pay. Because we stand committed to a philosophy of continuous plenty, we have set ourselves resolutely against waste —waste that comes from unneeded production, waste that imperils the Nation's future by draining away the abundance with which God has enriched our soil."", ""Increasing production alone in an unlimited way appeals to no person who thinks the problem through. Increasing consumption must go hand in hand with it. Here is a simple figure to mull over. If every family in the United States had enough earning capacity to live on what the doctors and dietitians call a Class-A Diet, we would need foodstuffs from forty million acres more than we are using today. America's diet is better than that of most .other Nations, but from the point of view of better national health, it is still inadequate. I seek to increase purchasing power so that people can pay for more food and better food, and in turn provide a larger and larger domestic market for the farmer."", 'It is a further part of our long-time farm policy to attack the evil of farm tenancy. In this we have already made a good beginning with lower interest rates and better prices. We are preparing legislation, in cooperation with farm leaders, to submit to the Congress in January to help solve this problem. We cannot, as a Nation, be content until we have reached the ultimate objective of every farm family owning its own farm.', ""Further, we propose to give to the farmer and to the consumer, a sound plan of crop insurance in kind against extreme fluctuations of supply and of price. No one wins from such fluctuations except the speculator. The farmer and the consumer lose together. That is why crop insurance is a protection for both. At one and' the same time it banishes the consumer's fear of a food shortage and the farmer's fear of a food surplus. Until both are protected, neither is safe. The ultimate interests of the farmer and the consumer of America are the same."", 'That, my friends, is why I am not making one kind of speech to the farmers out here and another kind of speech to consumers in the big cities of the East. The same speech and the same policy must go for both.', 'It has taken a lot of education in these last few years, but the city dweller has now come to know that unless the farmer receives fair prices for what he produces, he cannot buy the things that are turned out in the shops and factories of the cities.', 'And so we plan for the future of agriculture—security for those who have spent their lives in farming; opportunity for real careers for young men and women on the farms; a share for farmers in the good things of life abundant enough to justify and preserve our instinctive faith in the land.', ""In all our plans we are guided, and will continue to be guided, by the fundamental belief that the American farmer, living on his own land, remains our ideal of self-reliance and of spiritual balance—the source from which the reservoirs of the Nation's strength are constantly renewed. It is from the men and women of our farms, living close to the soil that this Nation, like the Greek giant Antaeus, touches Mother Earth and rises with strength renewed a hundredfold."", 'We want to perpetuate that ideal, we want to perpetuate it under modern conditions, so that man may be strong in the ancient virtues and yet lay hold of the advantages which science and new knowledge offer to a well-rounded life.']",1
14,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"October 12, 1936","['Good morning. I have just got through breakfast; and I am glad to come back here to be introduced by Fred Cummings, who is an old friend of mine.', 'The last time I stood here, I think, was with Mrs. Roosevelt in 1920 when I was running for Vice President. A lot of things have happened since that time.', 'For example, I know of a lot of things that have happened to the beet-sugar industry. I want to tell you a story about that. It relates to beets, and it relates to a lot of other products. Way back in the campaign of 1932, a man brought on the train a chart showing the fluctuations of prices of various raw materials and agricultural commodities—cattle, sheep, corn, cotton, wheat, sugar, minerals such as gold, silver and copper, and so forth and so on. I found from that chart that some of these commodities had fluctuated an average of 400 percent up or down between 1920 and 1932. Well, I do not believe there is any permanent prosperity in a commodity that fluctuates 400 percent up or down, any more than there is in a mortgage or a home that fluctuates 400 percent up or down.', 'Therefore, back in 1932, we laid plans to try to iron out these up-and-down fluctuations and get commodities to more stable year-in and year-out price levels.', 'I think we have accomplished a good deal along that line. Sugar beets form one pretty good example. The average grower of sugar beets has recognized the fact that he is better off, if, when he puts his seed in the ground, he knows approximately what the price is going to be when he harvests his crop, than he would be in a highly fluctuating, speculative market. Whenever there are great fluctuations in prices, the .only seller who really ever makes money is the speculator. That is why we have tried to stabilize the prices of various farm commodities and other commodities as well.', 'I say this merely to give you one little slant on the general policy that the Government has been following during the last four years. I think that in the long run it is a sound policy for the country as a whole, whether it applies to the raw products of the soil or to the raw products of the mines.', 'If you are interested in following it further, go and get a chart of the prices of any of these raw materials from the nearest library and see what I mean. If you will follow the line showing the prices as they have advanced or declined, you will see a zigzag that will horrify you even if you check it back for only fifteen years.', 'I am going on from here down to Denver, and then farther down to Pueblo. It is the first time that I have been down in the middle part of the State since I took office in 1933. I have, however, been what they call ""a traveling President."" I have been trying to keep in personal touch with the Nation. I have been pretty well all around Colorado and I have touched a corner of Colorado several times. I am glad now to be able to get into the middle of the State and see at first hand some of the conditions. It is going to help me during the next four years.']",1
15,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"October 12, 1936","['America pauses today to honor Christopher Columbus—a great Italian whose vision and leadership and courage pointed the way to this new world of ours. Once launched upon this great voyage, he did not turn back. There were those who offered him the counsel of despair. There were those who thought that the price they were paying was too great. But the valiant admiral, firm to his purpose, sailed on. And all America pays him tribute today.', 'The spirit that animated those voyagers four centuries ago is not alien to these Western plains and mountains. You are scarcely removed one generation from men and women who, cast in the same mold, sought to conquer nature for the benefit of the Nation.', 'It is from the rich diversity of climate, soil and people that this country has always derived its strength. The lives of you men and women in the mountains and plains are tied up with those on the farms and in the cities.', 'In our unified national economic life, we have come to realize that industry is not immune if agriculture or mining languishes.', 'The great but uneven prosperity of the nineteen-twenties made us neglect for too long the growing signs that things were not going right with the farmer and miner.', 'Surely by now we have learned that lesson. Surely you remember the idleness of your gold and silver mines, and your copper, coal, lead, and zinc mines, your oil fields, your railroads, your farms, your ranches; all of them had suffered together in the collapse of prices and income.', 'And when that stream of business had dried on the farms and plains and in the hills, the stream of business throughout the · Nation also dried.', 'In the complete stagnation of business, of mines and of farms, there was only one agency capable of starting things going again —the Government—not local government, not forty-eight State Governments, because they, strive as they would, had reached the limit of their resources, but the Federal Government itself. And yet, up to March 4, 1933, the Federal Government held back, doing nothing except to lend dollars to people at the top with the vain hope that some of it would trickle down, and except to fold its arms, stand still and wait for a certain famous corner to come to it.', 'When this Administration came in, its first act was to discover where the corner was and then to turn it. The turning of it involved action, and the action was based on two obvious and simple methods of locomotion: first, by spending money to put people to work, and, second, by lending money to stop people from going broke.', 'It meant doing these two things in the industrial East, and in the South, and in the Middle West, on the Plains, in the Rockies and out on the Coast. We knew that the only practical way to turn the corner was to start the whole country turning the corner at the same time.', 'One of the first jobs we trader took was assistance to the miners and farmers in the West.', ""Those of you who now see business moving again in your local shops and stores and factories know that your merchant's goods began to move off his shelves for the first time and that the wheels of your factories and mills began to turn for the first time, only after the Government had begun to spend money and had provided employment for millions of people on all kinds of projects."", 'Of course, we spent money. It went to put needy men and women without jobs to work, and to buy materials the processing of which put other men and women to work. You on the plains and throughout the great mountain area can judge for yourselves whether the work was worth doing.', 'Washington did not originate the projects. You did. You told us where reclamation projects were needed. You told us where water should be conserved. You told us where floods should be controlled. You told us where new homesteads should be located. You told us how Denver wanted to get its new water supply. You told us where roads needed to be improved. You told us, in short, in every State and city and county throughout this great region and, indeed, throughout these United States, the most practical way of giving work and at the same time creating public improvements of a permanent, useful character. And in the overwhelming majority of cases your advice was good.', 'Today in the late autumn of 1936 it is a pitiful spectacle to see Republican leaders call this great program waste and extravagance, for they are the same leaders who, when their own State or city or county was involved, were the first to run to Washington pleading for Federal aid. Consistency is still a virtue in life, but when it comes to a campaign year ""consistency"" is a word that cannot be found in the Republican campaign vocabulary. And, at that, inconsistency is a mild term to apply to it.', 'Take the effective example of livestock. If we had had more irrigation, more reservoirs, in the past, fewer cattle and sheep would have been threatened with starvation on the range during the drought years.', 'Lack of foresight on the part of former Administrations compelled us to buy up sheep and cattle which otherwise would have died in their tracks from lack of food and water.', 'This Administration is proud that it spent money to buy cattle and sheep in those days.', 'Republican leaders tell us that this, too, was a policy of waste.', 'Who benefited? The stockman who found a market and was literally saved from bankruptcy; the banker who held the mortgage on the stock; the merchant with whom both the stockman and the banker dealt; the packer who processed the meat. But, above all, those who benefited most were the unfortunate men and women and children on the relief rolls—hundreds of thousands of families all over the country—to whom the meat was distributed. Even the hides of these animals were saved.', 'I call that work program and cattle-buying program an investment to preserve America—the whole of American national life. Do you call it waste?', 'Much talk is heard about imports hurting the cattle industry. But the simple truth is that cattle imports have always been small, and always will be small as long as we have good range in the West and maintain our soil fertility in the Corn Belt. Cattle imports were largest when prices were best, as in 1929. Cattle imports were smallest when prices were lowest, as in 1932 and early 1933. The income to cattlemen in the first six months of 1933, when Canadian imports were less than 500 head, was less than one half of what it was in the first six months of 1936, when Canadian imports were larger, but still were only a trickle compared to domestic production. I believe it is better to prosper with small imports from Canada than it is to sink into depression and stay there with no imports at all.', 'Our cattle programs were carried out in cooperation with the stockmen themselves. And now also in the protection and development of the range we are acting in cooperation with them. Stock raising is a major industry in America. Its successful future shall be preserved.', 'Twenty years ago I was in the Mississippi Valley at the time of a great flood. I saw the waters of the Arkansas surge into the waters of the Mississippi. I asked where those waters came from. They told me that a part of them had come hundreds and hundreds of miles—all the way from Colorado. Farther up the river I saw the Missouri discharging its waters into the waters of the Mississippi. I asked where these waters had come from. They told me that a part of them had come from the Dakotas, from Montana, from Wyoming and from Colorado.', 'In later years I saw the bed of the Arkansas River bone dry; I saw many of the tributaries of the Missouri River bone dry.', 'It has been a part of our program from the very beginning to conserve the water resources of the country so that the beds of the rivers of all the important watersheds of America will work for the people of all the States through which they run.', 'There is nothing new in this. Way back in the summer of 1934, when I was dedicating the Fort Peck Dam in Montana, I said:', '""People talk about the Fort Peck Dam as the fulfillment of a dream. Why, it is only a small portion of a dream. The dream itself covers all the important watersheds of the States, and one of these watersheds is what we call the watershed of the Missouri, not only the main stem of the Missouri, but countless tributaries that run into it, and countless of the tributaries that run into these tributaries.', '""Before man- before American men and women get through with the job, we are going to make every ounce and every gallon of water that flows from the heavens and the hills count before it makes its way down to the Gulf of Mexico.""', 'I want to see that day come soon. It will help each and every State which lies between here and the Mississippi River. The work which we have already put under way to realize that dream is only a forerunner of what we hope to do in the days to come.', 'There were other resources of this great Western country, the development of which we undertook as an important and necessary part of the rounded objective. Take beet sugar for instance. I do not have to recite the record of steadily declining income in that industry before March, 1933. World production of sugar had expanded at such a rate that there was more sugar in the world than could possibly be consumed. What we tried to do, and what we succeeded in doing, was to adjust the supply of sugar so that a farmer who raises it gets a more adequate return. And you, the raisers of sugar beets, I congratulate not alone on better and steadier prices; I congratulate you also on the substantial reduction you have made in the employment of hired children in the fields. In this word of thanks I know I am joined by the fathers and mothers of America.', 'Take a final example. In these great mountain chains which extend from our northern to our southern border exists a storehouse of enormous wealth, its ultimate yield as yet unguessed.', 'The revival of industry, of farming and of transportation has provided a revival of mining—coal and iron and oil and copper and lead and zinc and many other metals.', 'But the Government has contributed by direct action as well. When we laid the ghost of the old gold parity of the dollar, when we purchased gold and purchased silver too, you in the mountains felt the old thrill of the search for precious metal. Old developments again became profitable. New developments sprang up. Mining became again an industry where men could find jobs.', 'The great bullion reserves now in the United States Treasury-and you in Denver know something about them—are sufficient to redeem every dollar of our currency far more than 100 percent; and yet people for partisan purposes are willing to spread the gospel of fear that our currency is not on a sound foundation. I tell you, and you know, that our monetary system is the soundest in the world today.', 'I tell you, and you will agree, that we are around the corner. Private employment is picking up. That means that Government expenditures for work for the unemployed are coming down. That means that the total of Government expenditures will decline. Turning the corner also means that Government income from existing taxes, without new taxes, is going up.', 'I repeat to you what I said in Pittsburgh two weeks ago, that decrease in expenditures and increase in income mean within a year or two a balanced budget and the beginning of reduction in the national debt.', 'When Republican leaders speak out here, they proclaim their sympathy with all these Western projects and promise you more and more of them. They cost money—they cost a lot of money. But when these same gentlemen speak to audiences in the East they proclaim that they are going to cut Government expenditures to the bone. If you will look in your history books you will find that about two thousand years ago there was an old Roman god named Janus. Janus had two faces. He faced both ways. Fie had two mouths. I need not explain that parable any further.', 'Are you willing to turn America, are you going to turn America over to those who in past years shut their eyes to the problems of this Nation?', 'This Administration has shown the way because it had the will to do.', 'We have sought and found practical answers to the problems of industry and agriculture and mining. We have clung to no outworn method as an excuse for failure to act. We have had faith not in panaceas, but in the courage and resourcefulness of men and women to meet their problems themselves if given a chance, an opportunity that is the right of every American. We have used the resources of Government to give that chance, not to a favored few, but to all the people of this great Nation with all of their richly diversified interests.', 'We are made firm by the same spirit that made Columbus surge on- by the same spirit that made the ancestors of you who dwell in these mountains and on these plains win through the untrailed wilderness, across turbulent rivers and unknown plains and deserts, over unscaled heights, to claim, develop and hold a new and great empire for America.', 'We have shown our determination in the past by action. You can trust us to prove that determination in the future by more action, sound action, action that is saving and will continue to save the Constitutional representative form of government in which all America rejoices.']",1

That is just what I am doing in coming out here, just what I have been doing on a good many trips in the last four years—trying to get to know this country better. I have seen the Garden of the Gods in Colorado Springs on several occasions before, and some day I want to come up here and spend a week or two.', 'You know, there has been a good deal of difference in tourists. In 1932, when I came out through here, there were a lot of tourists-but they were riding in box cars. This year there are more of them- and they are riding in Pullmans.', 'That is one thing I am very happy about. People all over the country have more wherewithal with which to travel and see their own country. I tell people back East that their duty is to come out West rather than go over across to Europe.', 'It is fine to see you all.

In this particular section of the State I know that you are interested in a lot of things that I, too, am interested in—soil conservation, getting water on the land, irrigation, and the prevention of floods.', 'We have been trying to accomplish a great many of these things that are badly needed by people in various communities of the Nation. Up at the Capitol of the State this morning, I told the people of Denver, that in carrying out these public works of various kinds we were trying principally to construct those things that were recommended by the localities themselves, by the Governor and the people back home. The result has been that through this expenditure of money, we have done much to help prosperity back to its feet right at home.', 'You will notice, if you travel as much as I do, that there are very few empty freight cars standing these days on the sidings of the railroads of the country. A great many old engines have been brought out of the roundhouses and reconditioned. More engines are being built, more steel is being used in all kinds of construction—and you people in Pueblo ought to know about the use of steel.', 'As a matter of fact, the whole process ties in together. With the return of prosperity we are getting more tourists; we are getting more freight to haul on the railroads; we are getting better prices for our crops. I am looking forward confidently to a continuation of that renewed prosperity.', 'I hope to be able to come back here from Washington during the next four years and see how it has grown.', 'It is good to see you all.

This year they are riding in Pullmans, and there are more of them, and there are going to be still more to come.', 'In connection with our railroad problem, we have been trying to tie it into the broad policy of social security; and that is one reason why the Railroad Retirement Act, that splendid piece of legislation, was passed by the Congress.

I realize what the drought has done all through this part of the country, and I want to tell you that I am very, very much interested in the work that the Federal Government is trying to do to alleviate drought conditions so that they will not be as bad in the future as they have been this year. We have an enormous number of national problems which we are trying to solve in a national way.', 'Things certainly are better. At least, people who raised only five or ten bushels of wheat to the acre got more than twenty-five or thirty cents a bushel, which was the price in 1932.', 'Because we know we always have to look ahead with respect to farming or business or anything else, the Federal Government has planned a program for the agricultural part of the Nation which is going to maintain prices. That is a long step. If, in addition to that, we can bring more water to the land where needed by keeping the water table up, and if we insist on using land only for its best purposes, then farming in the days to come will be a much more secure career for anybody than it ever before has been in our country.', ""The first thing we are trying to do is to stabilize prices. After all, you are not the only people who have been 'farming. I have done it myself both in the North and the South. One of the things we have suffered from most is the fluctuation of prices in the last ten or fifteen years, prices running up and down the scale as much as 400 or 500 percent. I want to be able to know, when I plant a crop, approximately what it is going to bring when I harvest it."", 'That is one of the results for which we are working. When you have these fluctuations, there is only one group which benefits from them—speculators. We want an agricultural system in which the growers of crops make the profits rather than the speculators in crops.', 'I am glad to get into Kansas again.

Of course, I have read about them and have read all the reports about the drought and about the subject of water conservation. I can say that your Government is extremely interested in the whole problem of water.', 'As I travel all the way down the Arkansas River, I am confirmed in the opinion I formed years ago—that in the watersheds out here in the West we have to aim ultimately at making use of every single drop of water that comes out of the heavens, as it comes down through all the States between the Rocky Mountains and the Mississippi River.', 'We have not only the problem of soil conservation; we also have the problem of floods. As you know, I am a great believer in trying to think and plan ahead. If we had thought and planned ahead twenty-five or fifty years ago we would be a good deal further along in the solution of both these problems than we are today.', 'Those problems and others which we face cannot be solved in the course of five years or ten years, but we have learned a great deal about scientific law. When I was a small boy, people did not appreciate nearly as much as we do today the dangers of flying in the face of Nature. I am convinced that by the cooperation of the Federal Government and the State Government and the local government, and by taking the advice of people who live on the land itself, we are going to make this whole country out through here a much safer place in which to live in the course of the next generation. We are aiming at security, security not just for one year or two years but security which comes from attaining the objective of making farming and cattle-raising real careers, by which a man and his wife and family can earn a decent living.', 'And that, in turn, is all part and parcel of what we are trying to do to provide security against unemployment and old-age distress throughout the United States.

But I am not going to talk to you about your own local affairs or about your State affairs because you know more about them than I do.', 'I do want to say a few words about what we have been trying to do all through this drought area during the past few months, and what we are going to try to do this winter and next spring.', 'The problem we are up against is almost nationwide. For while the drought area does not cover the whole Nation, the results of the drought affect people in the East and all the way out on the Pacific Coast. That is well borne out by the brighter side of the picture we have seen during these past three years—a renewed and growing prosperity which affects all parts of this interdependent Nation.', 'The fact of an increasing purchasing power means that the merchants in all of these towns are selling more goods. When they sell more goods, it means that the people in the industrial areas have more work, and if they have more work, they can eat more beef and more wheat. When they buy more beef and more wheat, the farmers are more prosperous. That is what makes it a rounded picture. While I recognize the fact, for instance, that you have had a mighty short wheat crop this year, it is just so much better that wheat is bringing a dollar a bushel or more instead of the thirty cents of four years ago. I think we are coming to recognize the interdependence of all groups all over the country.', 'I was saying this morning that three years ago, when I came through, there were a lot of tourists going through the West but that they were going through on box cars and on the tops of trains. Now there are more tourists, but they are going through in Pullmans.', 'And the cost of it? Yes, there has been cost in keeping people from starvation, in keeping people from losing their farms and their homes. But it is money not only well spent; it is money which is coming back a thousand times over.', 'What we have to do is to bring some of these figures with nine or twelve zeros after them down to a point where you and I can understand them. I shall put it to you this way. I shall put it in the form of a question: If somebody came to you and said, ""If you will borrow $800 and by borrowing that $800 increase your annual income by $2,200,"" would you borrow it or not?', 'Well, that is about what has happened in the past three years. The Federal Government has gone into debt a net amount of eight billion dollars, but the annual national income has increased over twenty-two billion dollars.', ""I am fairly confident that if we keep things going the way they are now headed, if we tackle problems like the drought with the idea that you people and your children and your children's children are going to remain here and keep on being farmers or raising cattle in this section—I am confident that when I come back here again during the next four years I shall find things much better than they are today."", 'Incidentally, let me remind you that I am making the same kind of talk out here in Western Kansas that I am making back East.', 'This is, as you know, a very informal talk. I wish I could visit with you a little longer. I am going to ask you to excuse me, however, for a very simple reason. I have a sort of double duty to perform these days. I am a candidate for reelection, and this is, therefore, I suppose, a political trip. Nevertheless, at almost every station that we have come to, I have been receiving documents and papers to be signed and telegrams or telephone messages on which I have to take action. This afternoon there have been an unusually great number of things sent to me to pass upon.

The place I went through was known locally as Kansas, and I often wondered why it was called Kansas. Long years later, in trying to find out the origin of the name, I ran across an old file of a local newspaper and found that in 1857 an enterprising railroad man had come into Dutchess County and had offered a free trip to Kansas to anybody who wanted to go there. That was one of the ways in which Kansas was settled, as you all know. Back there in Dutchess we feel that we have a special link with this State because a great many families, I think three or four dozen, came out here in those early days.', 'I come back here after four years to find that things have changed a good deal. I have noticed in traveling on the railroad that there is a different type even of tourists. Four years ago there were a lot of tourists who were riding in box cars and on top of trains. Today they are riding in their own automobiles and in Pullmans.', 'You know, on a day like this it seems a pity to have to mention an election. But we people have a habit once every four years of having a grand fight, and getting over it the day after election. November 3d is exactly three weeks from today and I expect to survive those three weeks.', 'If later on I shall have to write another book I am going to have a chapter in it about bedtime stories—political bedtime stories. It will be a very amusing chapter. I am going to fill it with whispering ghosts and stalking bogey-men, and I am going to end the chapter by telling how the American men and women on the third of November, 1936, refused to be frightened by fairy tales. You people do not look to me the least bit frightened.', 'And yet some people have been trying to tell you all kinds of things about what this Administration is seeking to do. They have tried, I am sorry to say, to spread the gospel of fear not only in the factories, which is an old outworn trick, but this year they are even trying to bring fear into the homes and firesides of America.', 'But I know that the people of this country have not such short memories. They remember only too well the real fear-the justified fear—felt all over the Nation in 1932, to be frightened by this silly false fear which is now being preached. The Republican leaders who are trying to do it, incidentally, happen to be the very ones whose blindness to facts and refusal to act caused the real fear and the real danger of national disaster in 1932.', 'What this Administration has done since 1933 to clear up the debris which had been left over by twelve years of neglect need not be repeated; you all know it. You know what the ""devil-take-the-hindmost"" policy of the nineteen-twenties brought down upon our heads. You know that the vast speculative gains of a few were made without any regard to the deep injuries which they were causing to the great masses of our people.', 'In the spring of 1933, these same speculators pleaded with me for help—help of any kind—just so long as it would save them from bankruptcy. Most people thought that they had learned their lesson. We hoped that they would join with our average citizens in working for some kind of security against a recurrence of those panic years.', 'Yet here they are- three years later—giving vague lip service to that word ""security"" and, at the same time, seeking to block, to thwart, and to annul every measure that we have taken to restrain the kind of individualism which hurts the community itself, individualism run amuck.', 'I use this word ""security"" not in the narrower sense of old-age pensions and of unemployment insurance, fine as these objectives are. I use it in the broader sense—confidence on the part of men and women willing to carry on normal work, and willing to think of their neighbors as well as themselves, confidence that they will not have to worry about losing their homes, about not having enough to eat, about becoming objects of charity. Add to that one more objective: that all Americans may have full opportunity for education, for reasonable leisure and recreation, for the right to carry on representative Government and for freedom to worship God in their own way.', 'That philosophy has been the philosophy and the practical objective of your national Administration at Washington. I do not seek to discuss with you the pros and cons of your local government or of your State Government in Kansas. You know more about that than I do. Let me say only, and in very simple terms, that I do not believe that Kansas would have pulled through the difficult problems of the past four years as splendidly as it has, had it not been for Federal cooperation and Federal assistance in many fields of your endeavor.', 'If you think we were wrong to give this assistance, then, to be logical, you must ask that in the days to come every State in the Union shall set itself up as an individual entity for the solution of all of the problems of all of its inhabitants, save possibly the maintenance of the Army, the Navy and the handling of our foreign affairs.', 'Our broader interpretation of security and of the methods of procuring it is well illustrated by what you have seen us do. Our endeavors have fallen into three broad classifications.', 'First, immediate and direct assistance—including work for the unemployed; help for drought areas; buying of drought stricken cattle; building of ponds and irrigation projects; seed loans; assistance to the youth of the Nation, and dozens of other instances of that kind.', 'Second, protection against recognized abuses of many kinds-including the battle of the Federal Government against kidnapping, blackmail, bank robberies and other menaces to life and liberty; safeguarding innocent investors against fake securities; the regulation of stock exchanges; regulation of overreaching practices of some utility companies and the establishment of power yard-sticks to force reasonable electric rates; elimination of unsafe banking practices.', 'Third, the reduction of interest rates; the saving of farms and homes from mortgage foreclosures; the insurance of bank deposits; the loans that have been made to keep railroads going; the assistance given to States, counties and cities, enabling them to build much-needed, useful public works; old-age pensions; unemployment insurance; assistance to rural schools; the C.C.C. camps; farm-to-market roads. These, and many more like them, give you a broad picture of the more permanent and long-range measures, many of which will improve not only your lives, but those of your children as well.', 'There was at one time a school of thought in this country that would have us believe that those vast numbers of average citizens who do not get to the top of the economic ladder do not deserve the security which Government alone can give them. And in the past, unfortunately, that philosophy has had too large a hand in making our national economic policies. That school of thought left Washington on March 4, 1933.', 'The farmers of the Nation furnish a very good example of what Government can do, not only in direct help, but also in providing security for the future. From a state of collapse in 1932, agriculture has not only been brought back to life, but has also received the encouragement of Government which enables it to face the future with confidence.', 'Is there among the many farmers in this audience, a single one who would want to go back to the uncooperative formula—the rugged individualism, the economic freedom of 1932?', ""Don't you and your wife and your children look forward to a safer, better future today than you did three and a half short years ago?"", 'I have used farming as an illustration of greater security because Kansas is a great farming State. You know, however, that the mining areas and the livestock areas and the industrial areas of the country are likewise receiving their share of a greater security. Every part of the Nation is sharing it together.', 'Last April in the City of New York I dared to talk farming to a New York City audience. I told them that one of the best things that had come out of these three years was the realization by city dwellers that they could not be prosperous until the farmer was also prosperous. In the same way I have dared to talk to people in great agricultural States about the needs of the industrial workers in the big cities, and how closely their welfare is tied up with the lot of the farmer.', 'People who are spreading the gospel of fear talk about setting one class against another. They have intimated that farmers belong to one class, industrial workers to another, and business to still another. I deny it. They all belong to the same class, for the very simple reason that none of these occupations can survive without the survival of the others.', 'The people who talk about these class distinctions are the very ones who are encouraging class antagonism. For they tell one story in the East and another story in the West; they tell one story in the city and another story on the farm. That is not my way, and never will be my way.', 'Taking it by and large, we are coming through a great national crisis with flying colors. We have not lost our self-respect. We have not changed our form of government. We have a net national debt which, though greater in dollars, is actually less in proportion to the income of the Nation and in proportion to the wealth of the Nation than the national debt was on March 4, 1933.', 'From the point of view of national income and national wealth, we are better able to bear our debt now than we were then. And, within a year or two, with income increasing and expenditures declining, we shall be able to balance the budget, and start paying down on the debt.', 'There is one final form of security on which I have not yet touched. In addition to security at home and in the home, we have sought for security from war with other Nations. We have not been content merely to talk about peace. We have done something about it. We are trying to break down the economic barriers, to soften the economic rivalries, to end the economic strife between Nations; for these have been the causes and forerunners of war. We have taken the lead among the Nations of the world in restoring economic peace which is so essential to military peace.', 'In the whole of the Western Hemisphere, all the way from the North Pole to the South Pole, we have preached, and we have gained recognition of, the doctrine of the good neighbor. We have extended the right hand of fellowship. Many Nations of the earth have taken that outstretched hand. We propose, of course, no interference with the affairs of other Nations. We seek only by force of our own example to spread the gospel of peace throughout the world.', 'We are gaining peace and security at home. I am confident that I have the support of the American people in seeking peace and security abroad.']",1

I am glad to come to this home town of former Governor Hodges."", 'I have been tremendously interested in coming through Kansas today to see with my own eyes a lot of things I have been reading in reports back in Washington. I could not get here on the trip to the drought areas. You have had some pretty hard times with your crops in this State; but I take it that conditions here this year are not quite as bad as they were in the western part of the State.', 'I think you all realize that what we have been trying to do for agriculture in the past three years has been aimed at greater security for the men, women and children on the farms. I think we have got somewhere.', 'Somebody remarked that our agricultural policy was like that of the automobile makers—a new model for every year. I accept that simile; I think it is a pretty good one. Each year we are making great progress in our national policy toward agriculture.', 'Of course, it has to be a national policy. It cannot be forty-eight different kinds of policies. And each year, in working toward the ultimate goal of security for agriculture, we not only have changed the laws, but we plan to continue to change them. We are not changing the fundamental objectives; but we are saying, just like the automobile manufacturer, that while the principle of the car is the same as it was twenty years ago, we have got past Model T. While Model-T agriculture may have been all right ten years ago, we do not want it any more. We have got beyond it.', 'There is no question, also, that our objective of a greater stability of prices for crops is something that the whole Nation not only needs, but wants. Certainly it is important for us not to go back to nine-cent corn and thirty-cent wheat and two-cent hogs. Having put the price level back to a more reasonable figure, we believe that we shall be able to keep it there.', 'Yes, this year we are planning; and why not? After all, that is one of the things that Government is intended to do, to think not in terms of just this year and the next, but, for the good of the people, to think for many long years ahead.', 'When you build a schoolhouse—and I know you have built some new schoolhouses in Kansas, some of them with the help of the Federal Government—you are building it, not just for the number of children who will attend school this year, but you are thinking ten and twenty years ahead. You know from experience that the improvements which go on in education have not stopped going on. You know that the improvements have to continue in the future in every single thing we do, just as they have in the past. That is the simplest way of expressing the philosophy that lies behind the kind of government we have been trying to give in the past four years.', 'One of the important factors in trying to work out a Government program in these past four years has been the fact that we tried to give to the communities every assistance based on what they themselves decided were their needs. Through these years, our whole farm program has been built up with the cooperation of the farmers themselves. We are trying to get the best cross-section of expert opinion we can find.', 'That has been the basis of what we have been trying to do, and I think in another four years we shall be able to carry the country a good many steps farther toward a greater security and prosperity.', 'Good-bye and good luck.']",1

I am quite confident that we shall have several million more voters go to the polls this election day. That is entirely as it should be.

And in your own States you have all seen other examples of waste in the physical resources of our country—water, trees, birds and other wild life."", 'But through the years of this depression we have had destruction even more tragic than that—waste in men and women, in human skill, character and life. Of all of the appalling waste of the days of false prosperity and recent disaster, human erosion has been the most calamitous.', 'There was, unfortunately, for a long time in the high places of Government in Washington a school of thought that human waste was the concern only of private charity and local communities. We have learned a lot since those days. We no longer believe that human beings hit by flood, drought, unemployment or any other national disaster should be left to themselves with the sole help of such charity as may be locally available to them. We know from sad experience that there may not be enough to go round.', 'Government since March 4, 1933, has begun to take stock of the human resources of the Nation and it is determined to preserve them.', ""As we take stock, we recognize that the most priceless of our human assets are the young men and women of America—the raw material out of which the United States must shape its future. Nature's deepest instinct is the concern in every parent's heart for the welfare of the children. It is a law of nature which equals even the instinct for the preservation of life itself. Indeed it is part of that law, for without the preservation of youth, the race itself would perish. And so, the highest duty of any Government is to order public affairs so that opportunities for youth shall be made ever broader and firmer."", 'We Americans have never lost our sense of this obligation. To a greater degree than any other peoples we have sought to give each rising generation a little better chance in life than the one that preceded it. The little red schoolhouse for the education of the young, and the church for the training of their spiritual qualities, have always been the first structures to rise in every new settlement, as our ancestors pushed new frontiers through the wilderness. The school is the last expenditure upon which America should be willing to economize.', 'Those of us who helped build up the fantastic jazz era of the nineteen-twenties, which crashed down over our heads, must feel a peculiarly deep sense of responsibility to our boys and girls who were sunk with us in the ruins.', 'I need not remind the young people of this country of the black future which lay ahead of them in those days. That was the era of the wanderers—boys and girls who had grown tired of living on the vanishing savings of their parents, and who had set out on the highways in all directions to look for work which they could not find.', 'Those in school and those out of school could not look forward to a place in the community. The door of opportunity had been slammed in their faces.', 'Hanging around on street corners, roaming about the country in bands vainly looking for work—there was the real danger which America faced.', 'When the history of the dark days out of which we are now coming is written, it will be said that the great marvel of this period was that those young people have come through, with a full faith in democracy and with a high resolve to preserve it at all costs.', ""Cities couldn't help, counties couldn't help, States couldn't help. Even big business couldn't help. They had all come to the end of their resources. The youth of America had apparently come pretty close to the end of the road."", 'That was the condition that confronted your Federal Government on March 4, 1933. Your Federal Government acted.', 'Before it laid its hands to any other problem- and there were many of them—it set up the C.C.C. camps to put an immediate end to that hopeless condition. It cost money to do that, just as it cost our pioneer fathers and mothers money to build the schools in which we have all been trained.', 'We have done much in the way of a beginning to remove the things in America which have made for waste in human beings. On the farms and in the cities—throughout the Nation—we are starting to remove those glaring inequalities, those deep-rooted maladjustments which did so much to bring about disaster.', 'The American people joined with us in 1933 to start this job. A vast majority of the American people in 1936 are with us to see it through. We have made the start in these days, confident that you—the youth of the country—will carry on to finish the job.', 'That is why we have a national youth program. That is why through our C.C.C. camps and the National Youth Administration we are trying to keep young people at useful work or in useful education. In high schools and in colleges the Federal Government has lent a helping hand in keeping youth at the job of learning. Out in the woods, out in the open, the Federal Government has kept the self-respect and the health of hundreds of thousands of young people.', 'The Federal Government for many years has spent a good many millions of dollars—well-spent dollars too—to conserve our forests, our crops and our livestock. We believe in that kind of conservation. You all know how much we have done in that kind of conservation. But now we have begun to spend money on much more important conservation—to save the energy, the ability and the spirit of youth. No money was ever better spent.', 'Nothing has made me happier on this trip than seeing at first hand that the youthful hitch-hiker has disappeared from our highways and from the box cars and freight trains. The youth of the land can once more look forward with confidence and courage just as we of the older generation did in our day.', 'No greater satisfaction can come to me than the realization that the youth of America understand what we have tried to do—and approve. They know that the price we have paid to save our country has been worth while.', 'America has lost a good many things during the depression. Some of them needed to go; I am glad that they have gone. We have lost, for example, that false sense of values that puts financial success above every other kind of achievement. We have lost a little of our cocksureness, a little of the bumptiousness which the Pharisee had when he thanked God that he was not as other people. We have lost something of that feeling that ours is an ""every-man-for-himself"" kind of society, in which the law of the jungle is law enough.', 'But many things we have saved—things worth saving. We have saved our morale. We have preserved our belief in American institutions. In this world of ours where some Nations have taken perilous detours, we have faced our problems and have met them with a democracy. Within that democracy we are determined to keep on solving them.', 'We have saved above all our faith in the future—a faith under which America has only begun to march.', 'In that march America will have to be led in the days to come by the youth of today.', 'It has been our job to clear the ground of what in too many places was a social and economic wilderness. That pioneering has only begun. It will be for you to continue it.', 'You will discover that in pushing forward this great program of social betterment and social security, you will be met by the same opposition, the same relentless resistance which faced the frontiersmen of the early West. You will find that your fight against selfishness and injustice, against oppression, and, above all, against war, will take you into a man-sized struggle.', 'I am telling you this not to discourage you, but to stimulate you. Our fight- yours and mine- is to keep our democracy safe by keeping it moving forward. In such a fight it is an unhappy place to be on the side lines. To the young people of America I say: Join with us; ours is the real struggle to continue and preserve democracy in America.']",1

In every State I have been in, which includes not only the agricultural States but the industrial States as well, things seem to be coming back. People, on the whole, are a lot better of[ than they were four years ago.', 'There is no panacea either of mind or medicine that the Nation can take that will cure it of all its ills overnight. But, as you know, we in Washington have been trying to build up a great many things all through the country that needed to be built up, realizing that the industrial workers in the cities cannot be prosperous unless the farmers are prosperous too. You can see the results by watching the railroads. The old strings of empty cars on the sidings that we used to see from 1929 to 1933 are almost all out at work, going up and down the line, full of various kinds of products.', 'At the same time, we have worked for a greater security for the people. One of our basic troubles in the past was found in the fluctuation of prices. Some time ago, I got a chart showing the prices which raw materials of all kinds brought between 1920 and 1933. That was a period of about thirteen years, and the line indicating prices was a zigzag line that went up and down and up and down. The farmer, the miner, the producer of industrial goods could never know what he was going to get because of this fluctuation. And so we have been trying to work out what might be called a more ordered economy, a more stable price level.', 'To use a simple example: if you borrowed or loaned a thousand dollars this year, we have tried to see to it that by 1940 when you pay the money back or get the money back, you will pay or receive the same kind of a thousand dollars that you handled originally instead of dealing in debts which had to be paid, for instance, as occurred not so long ago, with dollars worth three times as many bushels of wheat as when they were incurred. There were many hundreds of thousands of debts that were incurred when wheat was selling at a dollar a bushel but fell due when wheat was selling at 33 cents, so that it took just three times as many bushels of wheat to pay them off. That just is not right; and so we are trying to work for a better balance of price levels in order to prevent its recurrence. It is going to take a number of years to do; but I think the people of this country want stability and security in their economy, so that they will know from day to day, from year to year, that the future is not going to leave them objects of charity.', 'It is a big task that we have before us. I do not pretend to be the final word as to whether we are going to accomplish it or not; but I do know that in these past four years we have been getting somewhere, and I am determined that we will continue to get somewhere farther in the next four years.']",1

And your geographical location is such that you get in this State a pretty good bird\'s-eye view of people from the East and from the West and from the North and the South.

After those years that we went through, we can feel very proud of the way we have come back, with smiling faces and with the determination never to go through that kind of period again.', 'There are so many things I should like to talk about that I could keep on campaigning for a couple of months. You are here in the heart of a great agricultural community, a great agricultural State. I am telling the people in the East as well as in the West, that the prosperity of the farmers of the Nation makes for the prosperity of the industrial workers in the greater cities. The industrial workers cannot have prosperity unless the farmers do. I think we recognize that in these past three years we have gone a long way toward reestablishing a parity, of reestablishing the purchasing power of the farmers, a purchasing power which started to slip in 1920 and kept on slipping right down to 1933.', 'We are determined that we will keep on going—working for a balanced economy. We want you people here in Illinois to be prosperous, but we want the people in the South to be prosperous too, also the people out on the Plains and on the Pacific Coast. After all, when you come down to it, down in the South where I have a farm myself— incidentally, I do not make much money on it— if they get a good price for their cotton it means that they can up here. In the same way, if you have more money up here to buy more corn and more hogs and more things produced by you spend you can buy more overalls made out of the cotton of the South. In other words, it is a rounded whole.', 'We do not want to accept this theory that some economists have that we have to have a continual fluctuation between prosperity and depression. We want to bring prosperity back and make it stay.', 'All through the country I find evidence of a real understanding of what your Government is trying to do.

When I was farther out West I found that people were going around telling about the ghosts of taxes. They were telling people that if I were reelected, I was going to impose a Federal tax, in some perfectly weird, ghost-like manner, on every farm and home in the United States.', 'But, luckily, my friends, there are not many actual believers in ghosts these days. Today, when I came into Illinois I found that a new ghost has been raised up before your faces. I am not worried. It is a new one, though. They tell you in this State, I understand, that I propose that no loans shall be made on any farm land for more than twenty-five dollars an acre.', 'Well, let us look at that picture for a minute. If I were lending money on farm land, the first question I would ask is, ""How much can that land produce?"" I own some farm land myself. Down in the State of Georgia I have a lot of land that I would not lend five dollars an acre on. But, up on the Hudson River, I have some pretty good land on which I would gladly lend a hundred dollars an acre. That kind of ghost in a political campaign always comes back on the fellow who raised it, for the simple reason that the people in this country have a lot more sense than some give them credit for.', 'During the last three years and a half, I believe that one of the greatest gains made by the United States has been the fact that more men and women of voting age— and I include in that statement some of them below voting age—are taking a more intelligent interest in their Government than ever before in our history.', 'There are some people in the United States who would like to turn the conduct of Government over to a selected, self-chosen few.

Well, the first job was to put the freight train back on the track and we did it. The next job was to get it moving again and we did it.

I came to a Chicago fighting with its back to the wall—factories closed, markets silent, banks shaky, ships and trains empty. Today those factories sing the song of industry; markets hum with bustling movement; banks are secure; ships and trains are running full. Once again it is Chicago as Carl Sandburg saw it—""The City of the big shoulders""—the city that smiles.

I have driven home that point.', 'Tonight, in this center of business, I give the same message to the business men of America—to those who make and sell the processed goods the Nation uses and to the men and women who work for them.', 'To them I say:', ""Do you have a deposit in the bank?

Bankruptcies are at a new low. Your Government takes some credit for that.', 'Are you in railroads? Freight loadings are steadily going up. Passenger receipts are steadily going up—have in some cases doubled—because your Government made the railroads cut rates and make money.', 'Are you a middleman in the great stream of farm products? The meat and grain that move through your yards and elevators have a steadier supply, a steadier demand and steadier prices than you have known for years. And your Government is trying to keep it that way.', 'Some people say that all this recovery has just happened. But in a complicated modern world recoveries from depressions do not just happen. The years from 1929 to 1933, when we waited for recovery just to happen, prove the point.', 'But in 1933 we did not wait. We acted.

Nothing. Why? For a very fundamental reason. That Administration was not industrially-minded or agriculturally-minded or business-minded. It was high-finance-minded-manned and controlled by a handful of men who in turn controlled and by one financial device or another took their toll from the greater part of all other business and industry.', 'Let me make one simple statement. When I refer to high finance I am not talking about all great bankers, or all great corporation executives, or all multimillionaires—any more than Theodore Roosevelt, in using the term ""malefactors of great wealth,"" implied that all men of great wealth were ""malefactors."" I do not even imply that the majority of them are bad citizens.

They wanted it to trickle down from the top, through the intricate arrangements which they controlled and by which they were able to levy tribute on every business in the land.', ""They did not want interest rates to be reduced by the use of Government funds, for that would affect the rate of interest which they themselves wanted to charge. They did not want Government supervision over financial markets through which they manipulated their monopolies with other people's money."", 'And in the face of their demands that Government do nothing that they called ""unsound,"" the Government, hypnotized by its indebtedness to them, stood by and let the depression drive industry and business toward bankruptcy.', 'America is an economic unit. New means and methods of transportation and communications have made us economically as well as politically a single Nation.', 'Because kidnappers and bank robbers could in high-powered cars speed across state lines it became necessary, in order to protect our people, to invoke the power of the Federal Government. In the same way speculators and manipulators from across State lines, and regardless of State laws, have lured the unsuspecting and the unwary to financial destruction. In the same way across State lines, there have been built up intricate corporate structures, piling bond upon stock and stock upon bond—huge monopolies which were stifling independent business and private enterprise.', ""There was no power under Heaven that could protect the people against. that sort of thing except a people's Government at Washington.

Increase the purchasing power of his customers on the farms—and we did it.', '4. Decrease interest rates, power rates and transportation rates—and we did it.5. Protect him from the losses due to crime, bank robbers, kidnappers, blackmailers—and we did it.', 'How did we do it? By a sound monetary policy which raised prices.

By our program to provide work for the unemployed, by our C.C.C. camps, and other measures, greater purchasing power was given to those who lived in our cities.', 'Money began going round again. The dollars paid out by Government were spent in the stores and shops of the Nation; and spent again to the wholesaler; and spent again to the factory; and spent again to the wage earner; and then spent again in another store and shop.

On the contrary, it represents private enterprise which has become a kind of private government, a power unto itself—a regimentation of other people's money and other people's lives."", 'Back in Kansas I spoke about bogey-men and fairy tales which the real Republican leaders, many of whom are part of this concentrated power, are using to spread fear among the American people.', 'You good people have heard about these fairy tales and bogeymen too.

When the President of the United States starts in to pare the budget and cut it down, the favorite expression is that it is my old Dutch blood which cuts it down.', 'Last night in Chicago, I was talking about conditions as they were four years ago and comparing them with conditions of today. Grand Rapids is a very good example of what has happened in four years. One of the points I made was that the return of prosperity did not just happen. Something had to be done—action had to be taken- to bring prosperity back.', 'In Grand Rapids you have an example of how we thought things through. The first thing necessary in 1933 was to stop people from starving, to give relief, to provide immediate work, to lend money to municipalities for furnishing work—in other words, to stop the deflation from going on.', ""After we had done that, there came the next step— the taking of measures to enable people to improve their living conditions. Through the establishment of many agencies, after we had saved many homes, we encouraged people to build new homes and to repair old homes. The Federal Housing Administration, in the last two years, has been responsible for the building or improvement of over five hundred million dollars' worth of homes. Let it be made perfectly clear that this money was not Government money. It was all private money from private lending agencies and all the Government did was to insure a portion of the loan. And, incidentally, it was a pretty good business proposition, because the loans are now being paid back, for the simple reason that people now have work."", 'Then came a third step—and this is where Grand Rapids comes in. After the homes were built and modernized, they had to have something to put into them, and Grand Rapids is providing the furniture that goes into those new and modernized homes.', 'It is, of course, a matter of record that the furniture industry, just to take one example of many industries today, is working at a much higher peak than at any time since 1929. I believe that the people of this country appreciate the fact that intelligent interest on the part of their Federal Government has resulted in very great strides in the last three and a half years toward bringing the country back to normal prosperity.', 'My friends, I hope in the next four years I shall be able to come to Grand Rapids as President of the United States and see you again.']",1
33,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"October 15, 1936","['Governor Murphy, Senator Couzens, my friends:', 'I am standing at the spot in front of the City Hall to which during the four terrible years, from 1929 to 1933, thousands of unemployed men and women of Detroit came to present problems of human existence to a great Mayor, Frank Murphy.', 'I am glad that he is standing beside me today. His splendid record, first as Governor General of the Philippines and later as High Commissioner of the United States to the Commonwealth of the Philippines, stands out as one of the most successful administrations in our history. The whole country is proud of Frank Murphy and proud of what he has done.', 'I knew something of the problems of Detroit in the depression years, not only from Frank Murphy, but also from my brother-in-law who was his City Controller.', 'We all knew that during those years the Government of this city pared its operating expenses to the bone, using every penny it could scrape together for the relief of thousands of men and women who were literally on the verge of starvation. When money had to be raised, the Mayor and Controller would go to private bankers in New York where they were compelled to pay very high interest rates for further loans.', 'By the spring of 1933 the city of Detroit could borrow no more from private sources and the government of the State of Michigan · was unable to render any substantial help.', 'I recite these facts because while the problem of human relief in Detroit was one of the most difficult in the Nation, yet there were thousands of other municipalities faced with the same kind of crisis.', 'There they were on the fourth of March, 1933! And what was called for?', 'Action—immediate action—by the new Federal Government in Washington; and it is now admitted by all but the most blind partisans, that that was what saved the day. It was the only thing left which could save the day.', 'Relief and work relief through the use of Federal funds saved American humanity, and as the months went by it saved also the solvency of cities and States in every part of the Nation.', 'After we had stopped the immediate crisis, our next step was to restore the purchasing power of the people themselves. I need not recite to you the many steps we took. You are as familiar with them as I am. In great part you are glad today, I am sure, that we took these steps.', 'The problem involved building up purchasing power of every kind. In restoring it there is one element often overlooked by those who dwell in great industrial cities—the building up of the prices which farmers obtain for their farm products.', 'Let me give you a simple example. A South compelled to sell its cotton for five cents a pound, a Middle West compelled to sell its corn for ten or fifteen cents a bushel, its hogs for two or three cents a pound, its wheat for thirty cents a bushel, could buy no automobiles made in Detroit. But a South with ten—or twelve-cent cotton, a Middle West with seventy-five-cent corn, seven-cent hogs and dollar wheat, can start and has started buying passenger cars, trucks and tractors.', 'In all other fields of production prices and values also rose. Miners went back to work. Eastern factories opened their closed doors.', 'The dollars that we spent in relief, in work relief, in C.C.C. camps, in drought relief, in cattle and hog buying and processing, each of those dollars went to work. They were spent in the shops of the city and in the stores of the small towns and villages. They were spent again by the retailers who bought from wholesalers. They were spent again by wholesalers who bought from manufacturers and processors. They were spent again in wages to those who worked and in purchases from those who produced the raw materials back in the mines and on the farms. And once again they were spent in the stores of the cities and the shops of the small towns and villages. You know how many of these dollars have finally come to the City of Detroit in the purchase of automobiles.', 'I am reminded of a popular song. Literally the music went round and round and round and a lot of it came out right here in Detroit.', 'All I need to repeat is the statement known to most of you here, that 1936 promises to be the second largest year of automobile production in our history—three and a half times the value it was in 1932.', ""Detroit today is a very different city from what it was three years ago, and while the wheels of industry turn fast and while unemployment is very greatly decreased, yet there are many problems not yet solved. I do not accept the conclusion of many Republican leaders that major depressions are inevitable in modern life. It is not enough that we have ended the days in 1932 when workers in this city received for their labor as low as five or six dollars for two weeks' work. It is not enough that we have saved many homes and put thousands of people to work. I believe that it is the duty of Government to bend every effort to prevent another major catastrophe such as that which hit this country as a result of the Republican leadership which ran Government from 1921 to 1933."", 'There are a thousand and one things still to be done. It has been suggested that the Government\'s agricultural program is a ""hit or miss"" affair not worthy of support because, like an automobile, a new model is brought out every year. I have been glad to accept that comparison. I have told the farmers of this country that farming and farm policies, like automobile making, ought to improve each year, that Model-T farming may have been all right ten years ago but that we do not want Model-T farming or Model—T anything else in the year 1936.', 'I have suggested that the automobile industry and every other industry still need great improvements in their relationship to their employees. And I will illustrate the point by a story from my own personal experience. In the spring of 1934 there came to Washington representatives of the automobile workers, most of them young men without much experience in organized labor. One of them, a former Marine who had served through battle after battle in France, told me he was a machinist and that his pay was $1.25 an hour or $10.00 a day. I told him I thought that was a pretty good wage scale, and his reply was this: ""Yes, Mr. President, it is a good hourly rate and a good daily rate but last year I worked only sixty-eight days."" In other words, the total income of himself, his wife and his children was $680 for a year. On this yearly pay total he had lost the home on which he had paid down hundreds of dollars. He and his family were seeking to exist on $680 a year.', 'As a result of that meeting and of subsequent meetings with company officials, I stressed the need of spreading the work more evenly through the year and of working toward raising the yearly pay envelope of Detroit and other automobile cities from six or seven hundred a year to over a thousand or twelve hundred a year. Certain steps looking toward that end have been taken but they are not sufficient. It is my belief that the manufacturers of automobiles and the manufacturers of many other necessary commodities must, by planning, do far more than they have done to date to increase the yearly earnings of those who work for them.', 'Your Administration has that kind of objective in mind. It is my belief that the people of Detroit, like the people of the rest of the country, are going to ask on November 3d that the present type of Government continue rather than the type of Government which in its heart still believes in the policy of laissez faire and the kind of individualism which up to only three and a half years ago, frankly, put dollars above human rights.', 'When the smoke and dust of this political campaign clear away on the night of November 3d, history will record that the outstanding issue of the campaign was this: Shall the social and economic security and betterment of the masses of the American people be maintained and strengthened or not? You and I are not afraid of that verdict. It is going to be yes.']",1
34,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"October 15, 1936","['My friends of Flint:', 'I read in the papers that this economic recovery we see about us is not real. I have read lots of things in the papers and so have you. For example, I read the other day that some of our friends on the other side of the fence are telling us that other Nations are better off than we are. Well, I do not believe it; and I do not think you do either.', 'All we need to do is to take a look across the ocean to discover whether we are doing better on this side than some other Nations are. Believe me, there are a lot of people on the other side, who wish they lived here. We are not boasting about it; we are not moved by any braggadocio about it. Our policies in the last few years, including, incidentally, our recent policy of establishing reciprocal trade agreements with other Nations, have paved the way for a greater lasting security and good-will among Nations. I truly believe, in spite of the dark spectacle in some lands, that this generation and this Government have the best opportunity in a long time to take the lead in outlawing war as a relic of caveman days.', 'When some Republican spokesmen say that others are better off than we are, you and I know that they are only taking the counsel of desperation. They know that our policies are breaking a rift in the clouds of international doubt and anxiety. I call it true Americanism to set the world on its way to tranquillity.', 'My friends, the Republican leaders profess to be the custodians of the American system; and yet they find fault with everything that you and I know makes America the envy of the world in this good year of 1936.', 'I am thinking of Flint as it was in January, or February, or March of 1933, and Flint was not the only city that faced conditions of desperation. Faced with that widespread suffering from unemployment, this Administration, as you know, has followed a fixed policy—a policy that does not believe in the dole, on the ground that temporary charity without work results in a breakdown of self-respect. We did not believe in the dole then, and we do not believe in it today.', 'We do believe in work and, so far as it is necessary in this land, we will continue to provide work. So long as men and women need to be saved from starvation, we will continue to provide work, because these men and women need to be saved also from disintegration of morale. The millions of unemployed Americans lost many things in the depression, but there is one thing which we tried to see to it that they did not lose—they did not lose their self-respect.', 'And so we have come through the worst economic crisis in our history, and we have kept our morale. Money spent to do that was money soundly invested. We faced that choice in 1933; and it was a test of what I call straight economic thinking and good economic statesmanship, even if some professors did not agree with us.', 'We could have gone into the relief problem by spending, let us say, a dollar for a dole. That dollar for a dole would have kept unemployed men just alive—just in a state of suspended animation. Or we could think beyond our noses and spend, say, a dollar and a half on work instead of a dollar on a dole. That extra half dollar would maintain the normal relationships of the unemployed with their families and their grocers, and their merchants, and so on down the line. They could later slip back into normal industry in a normal way.', 'Yes, we chose to spend money in order to save men. But who can measure in dollars and cents what the self-respect and the morale of a people mean to their Nation? They must be measured, rather, in terms of the preservation of the families and the normal life of America.', 'But work relief has done more than that. In these many communities throughout the land, it has helped the unemployed to make a contribution of social value to the life of the Nation. Across the entire country a far-reaching series of structures has been built by the working unemployed—and I see a W.P.A. sign right out there by the gate—structures which for generations to come will contribute to the well-being and permanent happiness of the Nation.', 'Remember that no project has been adopted by the Federal Government except on recommendation of the local community itself. You people of Michigan initiated the projects in Michigan. And the people of the other States also told us which projects they wanted in their States. In the vast majority of cases your advice was good. This year you and I have noticed that the projects which are being criticized are never the projects in the community in which the critic lives. They are generally a thousand miles away.', 'You can look in your own towns, your own counties all through America, to see for yourselves what this work relief program has done—in schools and roads and pavements and reforestation and flood prevention and sanitation and in fifty or a hundred different types of undertakings that have no peacetime parallel in all of our history.', 'I am sorry not to meet an old friend of mine here- that there has passed on to the great Beyond General Guy Wilson whom I met in 1918 up on the Marne.', 'I am glad to have had this chance to come to Flint today. I am glad that things are so much better than they were a short four years ago.', 'My friends, all I can tell you very simply but very much from the heart, is that I am striving and shall continue to strive to bring a better balanced economy to the United States of America.']",1
35,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"October 15, 1936","['My friends, I am glad for many reasons to be with you tonight at this great gathering. I am happy to be here by the side of my old friends, Senator Couzens, Governor Murphy, Prentiss Brown and many others; and I am glad, also, to come to this dedication of one of the projects in which the Federal Government has been able to help your city.', 'As I came through those streets tonight, lined by thousands of men, women and children, I was thinking mostly about the children. I was thinking mostly about the days to come when they would be the citizens of the United States and would take our places in the conduct of the affairs of the State and of the Nation.', 'During these past three and a half years we have tried to do much to save the United States for these children. We have tried to keep people from starving; we have tried to save the homes of the Nation; we have tried to restore employment to the people of the Nation. I think that in these three years we have come a long way.', 'But it has not been only the immediate emergency that we have had to cope with. We have been thinking about some of the things that the country needs in addition to bare food and lodging. That is why a great stadium of this kind has been built. This stadium is one of the things that will last for many years and contribute toward the enjoyment and recreation, not only of us older people but of the younger generation as well.', 'Yes, I am thinking of a future America, where we may all have a little bit more of the better things of life than we have today, a little bit more in the way of money compensation for our work, a little bit more in the way of holidays—shorter hours and Saturdays off and Sundays off as well.', 'Some people in this country have called it ""boondoggling"" for us to build stadiums and parks and forests and to improve the recreational facilities of the Nation. My friends, if this stadium can be called boondoggling, then I am for boondoggling, and so are you.', 'I am looking forward to a continuation in the next few years of the policy that will work for the good of the average citizen in the United States, that will not forget the forgotten man. It has been a privilege to be with you tonight; and I hope that some time in the next four years I shall be able to leave Washington, and visit with you again.']",1
36,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"October 16, 1936","['I am glad, indeed, to come back to Cleveland; although once more I find that I am denied the privilege of seeing more of your Exposition.', 'I have had a wonderful time today, coming across Ohio with your Governor and your Senators. Indeed, it has been a very exciting and a very instructive trip all through the last ten days.', 'It has been cheering after these hard years to see on all sides smiling faces and happy crowds again. Four years ago there were crowds too, but they had the anxious faces of uncertainty and doubt, faces shadowed by trouble and fear of the future. During the past week the hundreds of thousands of men and women and children I have seen have cheerful faces and voices of courage and hope.', 'I am sure that you people in Cleveland and other parts of Ohio need no proof that your factories, your shops, your stores, your farms, are all doing bigger business, that those who work in them are getting more and fatter pay envelopes. If anyone needs recovery figures for Ohio, listen to these: Compare the first half of 1936 with the first half of 1933. What do you find? Employment in all industries is up 36 percent. Payrolls in all industries are up 83 percent. Electric power production is up 44 percent. Farm income, excluding benefit payments, is up 53 percent. Department store sales in the Cleveland Federal Reserve District are up 44 percent. Retail furniture sales in the same district are up 86 percent. And, one of the finest things of all, building permits in 47 Ohio cities have increased by 367 percent, from seven and one-half million to thirty-five million dollars. Residential construction in the same cities has increased 741 percent, from about two million dollars to about eighteen and one-half million dollars.', 'These figures show an increase in business for every group in Ohio. The fact that recovery has come to all of these groups is a refutation of the old theory which had guided the previous Administration, the old theory which I call the ""trickle down"" theory. That theory is that if you lend some money to the few financial interests at the top of the economic pyramid, it will trickle down and some of it will find its way into the pay envelopes of the workers, into the ledgers of the millions of independent business men throughout the Nation, and into the pocketbooks of the farmers. But the trouble with that theory was that there was always too little left to trickle down more than halfway.', 'Our theory for the last three and a half years has been just the opposite. We have acted on the conviction that the way to bring about recovery was to tackle the problems of those who were at the bottom of the economic pyramid, to increase earnings and income, and through them the purchasing power of everybody. We knew that sales could not be made to people who had lost the power to buy.', 'And so we tackled the problem from the point of view of all groups. What is happening today shows the soundness of that program.', 'Particularly was that true of the wage earners of the Nation. For the first time in many years the industrial workers and wage earners of America have had an Administration in Washington which was determined to give them an opportunity for a fairer wage and a more decent standard of working hours. We were determined to do this not only because that was simple justice, simple Americanism, but also because it was good business. And the business men of America now know that it was good business. They know that a great portion of their regained sales comes from the increasing purchasing power of those who work in the cities and on the farms.', 'The interest of every business man is bound to the interest of every wage earner. Whether he is running a store on the corner or is a stockholder in a corporation, big or little, he is financially better off when wages and working conditions are good than when wages and working conditions are poor. Surely the last panic proved that!', 'Remember that when men and women are idle, they are not in the market for the products of industry. When wages are low and the working week is long, their purchasing power is limited.', 'It is to the real advantage of every producer, every manufacturer and every merchant to cooperate in the improvement of working conditions, because the best customer of American industry is the well-paid worker. And the best guarantee of corporate dividends is a rising standard of living.', 'If the workers in a particular industry are poorly paid they become poor customers of every other industry and of every other merchant. And the corporation directors and lawyers who use the money of their stockholders to persuade their stockholders that they ought to chastise the Administration that is trying to broaden home and foreign markets for their own goods are, to put it mildly, a little foggy in their thinking processes.', 'In this era, when many families hold stocks in many diversified industries, it does them no good to depress the condition of labor in any industry. They profit best when labor profits best.', 'I said in Chicago, and I repeat here that the business men of America, the investors in business enterprises, are going to show on November 3d that they have not been frightened or fooled by the expensive propaganda of those who would seek to spread the gospel of fear—fear that this Administration is antagonistic to business.', 'Read the record of what we have done for business and you will find the answer to that charge. I repeat here that the record shows that no Administration in the history of the United States has done so much to encourage the business of the Nation.', 'Back in the spring of 1933 the whole system of free enterprise and private profit was on the edge of ruin. It had been dragged there by the same leaders who are now trying to scare you. It was because of our determination to keep the American system that we succeeded in doing what we did at a time when the system was almost buried under the ruins.', 'Few of the public are being fooled this year.', ""Every now and then stockholders and bondholders in the United States are flooded with literature warning them against returning this Administration to office. They probably will be appealed to again. That literature is being sent out from the center of the great financial district of New York. The money of the stockholders is being used to finance this literature. This waste of stockholders' money is being perpetrated by the same group which had brought business as a whole to its knees during the dark days of the depression. We fight only against that kind of concentrated wealth and economic power which in the old days used to dictate not only to the business of the Nation but to Government itself—against that small minority of financial interests whose concern was not the welfare of the Nation, not the welfare of business in America, but solely the extension of their own power. It is the glory of America that the standard of living is higher here than in any country or at any other time in the ,history of the world. The underlying issue in every political crisis in our history has been between those who, laying emphasis on human rights, have sought to exercise the power of the Government for the many and those, on the other hand, who have sought to exercise the power of Government for the few. We are now coming to learn that the interests of the few are best served when the interests of the many are best safeguarded."", 'That is our fight now. It will be won now as it has always been won in America since the day on which the members of the Continental Congress declared inalienable the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.', 'And so, on the third of November, which I take it is two weeks from next Tuesday, I am expecting a telegram from Cleveland and from Ohio; and I am confident of what that telegram will say.', 'Before we pull out, may I thank you all for staying here? We were very late getting in, but it was because of the very large crowds all the way from Cincinnati. I am grateful to you.']",1
37,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"October 16, 1936","['What is a little rain between friends? I am very glad to come to Cincinnati. I am very glad this morning to have seen some of the work with which the Federal Government has been able to help, first that slum clearance project, and then the bridge, and now this stadium.', 'I think all of you understand why the Federal Government has helped in work of this kind. In the first place, as we all know, we had an unemployment situation three years ago which was so imperative to remedy that we simply had to put people to work. Then came the question of finding the best kind of work for them, and that was put up to the localities. The communities-the cities and counties-throughout the United States told us what they most needed. And so the great bulk of the money that has been spent to give people jobs has been usefully spent, and spent at the request and upon the suggestion of the different States and municipalities of the Nation.', 'You know, I am sure, that this has aided very much in the national recovery which we have had during the past three years. There is not a merchant, or manufacturer, or professional man, or industrial worker, or wage earner in this whole city, I am sure, who does not say that things are better than they were.', 'And most of them know, too, that the recovery did not just happen of its own accord. It had to have the active help of Government.', 'And so today, my friends, in going around the country, I see tremendous improvement on every side.', 'We are also attempting to give a greater security to the Nation in the days to come. We are thinking about our children, we are thinking about fathers and mothers in their old age, we are thinking of greater permanency of jobs; all of these are objectives which modern civilization has delayed too long in taking up. But we have made a good start in taking them up.', 'By security, I do not mean just a living, just having enough to eat and a place to sleep. I mean a living according to the American standard—a standard which provides a decent diet, a decent education and a reasonable amount of leisure and recreation. That is why projects like this stadium that serve the enjoyment of people—just for sheer good times—are just as worth while as building bridges and stopping floods.', 'That kind of security, as we see it, applies not only to people with respect to their own individual family lives, but ought to apply to their occupations and ought to apply to the businesses which employ them.', 'That is why we are trying to make it a rounded picture—something that will affect not merely one part of the country but something that will affect every kind of occupation and business.', 'And so, my friends, on November 3d, which is not so very far off, we are going to have the issue presented to us: Shall we continue in the future, as we have been doing, to try to attain greater human security?I am not the least bit worried about the result.']",1

I am particularly glad to see, by the expression on your faces, that you are much more cheerful than you were in 1932.', 'You know, while I am theoretically a lawyer, I am also a bit of a farmer. I farm in two places, one on the Hudson River and the other down in Georgia. That is why I know something about farm prices. One reason why I think you here are more cheerful is because corn is selling at better than ten or fifteen cents a bushel and because hogs and cattle are selling at better than three or four cents a pound.', 'Of course, improvement in agricultural prices was one of the vital parts of the program that we started three years ago. And I am not going through the country making one kind of speech to farm people and another to city people. Nor am I making one kind of speech in the West and another kind in the East.', 'I believe that in the past few years the people of this country have begun to think in national terms. You, I know, understand that unless farm prices are good, the great farming population of this country cannot buy the things that are made in the cities. That means that the railroads do not make money because there are no goods to be hauled; and, in the same way, the people in the cities, unless they have work, cannot buy the produce of the farms in the country. In other words, we are all in the same boat, no matter what our occupation, no matter whether we live on the farm or in the city, no matter whether we live in the North or the South.', 'I know from personal experience that people in the cotton belt in this country cannot buy the foodstuffs produced in the North if they have to sell their cotton for four or five cents a pound. In the same way, you people cannot buy overalls made of southern cotton when you get only ten or fifteen cents a bushel for your corn.', 'I have always been particularly interested in the fact that this part of Ohio has gone in for diversification in farming. The more that we can diversify our farming all through the country and not have to depend entirely on one crop, the better it will be for the Nation as a whole. In that respect, you are setting a perfectly fine example for the farmers in the State of New York and for the farmers out West and for the farmers down South.', 'I am mighty glad to see you and I want to thank you on behalf of Mrs. Roosevelt for the flowers. They are perfectly beautiful, and there has not been a sunflower aboard the train yet. (The sunflower was the campaign flower of the Republican candidate for President, Gov. Alfred M. Landon.)', 'My friends, on the third of November I am expecting a telegram from the State of Ohio saying that all is well.']",1

It is not only the spot where I was nominated for the Governorship of this great State in 1928, but it is also the spot where I attended my first political convention in 1910.', 'I remember that meeting of twenty-six years ago chiefly because of the fact that the City of Rochester was so crowded that twelve of us from the Hudson River counties had to sleep in one room, and ten of us fought all night against the other two who wanted the single window kept closed. Those in favor of fresh air won the day. Perhaps there is a parable in this, because I have been fighting ever since in behalf of fresh air and fresh opportunity for the people of this country.', 'Since the Rochester convention of 1928 much has happened. That year we were in the midst of the great jazz era, socially, politically, economically, and financially. We were even then a sick Nation though we had not yet begun to feel the pain—the headaches and the heartaches.', 'It was a lop-sided economy we were living in. The wealth of the Nation was being concentrated quickly and steadily into the hands of a few individuals who were not only running the major part of our commerce and industry, but were actually running the processes of the national Government itself. It is an unfortunate fact that they were interested in their own welfare instead of in the welfare of the great majority of the people who were engaged in business, industry and agriculture.', 'The process of gobbling up more and more independent businesses by merger, by purchase or by reorganization was going on apace.', 'It was not long after I became Governor that the skies fell, and the crash came; and it is perhaps worth noting that when that happened your State Government undertook many policies which were ultimately the basis of the national legislation of the past three and a half years. We in New York started the ball rolling.', 'From 1929 to the spring of 1933, your State Government had to fight the depression alone. Yet it is a fact that this State was the first to undertake in a major way the care of its needy unemployed. It was, I think, the first State to tie in the success of its farming population with the prosperity of its industrial population, for it was in those years that we undertook to remove submarginal land from cultivation, to extend our forestry and our parks, our farm-to-market roads, and our cooperation with the farm organizations and the farmers themselves.', 'In those years also we started the splendid system of relief for the aged; we worked for the development of water power and for the reduction of rates for electricity, and we greatly strengthened the laws for the protection of labor.', 'It is also true that in the same period the opposition to social and economic legislation of this kind came from the same sources in this State which have opposed, and are opposing, the same type of forward-looking legislation and administration in the national capital.', 'I am happy indeed that during these past three and a half years the State of New York has continued and strengthened liberal Government under the wise and conscientious leadership of our great Governor, Herbert H. Lehman. His has been a task of great magnitude, but he has met each problem with successful action. He and I are happy today that the worst of the crisis is over. He and I are fighting today against the return of former conditions and former schools of thought.', 'Thank you, my friends, for this welcome. Thank you for coming out in this rain.

Most of you good people have seen me and I have seen you many times before.', 'A little while ago, although it was raining in Buffalo this morning and in Rochester a little later on, I looked out of the side window of the car and I saw a rainbow. I think that is a mighty happy omen.', 'We have had a very wonderful trip through a great many States. Everywhere that we went there was one thing that was different from the year 1932—there are now smiles on the faces of the men and women of America.', 'There is no question but that things are better in every part of the country. As you know, we have tried to work during these past three and a half years for a well-rounded economy. It has not been just a question of bringing one section of the country back or one State back at the expense of the others. We tried to bring back an economy, a prosperity, that would work all the way down the line, so that we could have a wider distribution of wealth and, with it, a few more good things for the average citizen of the country.', 'And in addition, we have been thinking not merely in terms of greater prosperity for the moment; we have been trying to look ahead, trying to look ahead toward obtaining a greater security for the men, and the women, and the children who are going to live in this country after us. That has been a very important objective which we have kept constantly before our eyes. I am convinced by personal observation that the people have come to realize more and more, especially in these past three and a half years, the importance of taking an active interest in Government itself and in the problems of Government.', 'As you know, it was only a few months after I first went to Albany as Governor in 1929 that this country was hit by the worst crash it had ever had in all its history. In those days in Albany, without any help from Washington, we started some of the things that we have transferred to Washington since I went there. We started old-age pensions in this State. We took care of needy unemployed in this State. With the help of the farmers and the farm leaders themselves we began, for the first time, a farm program in this State.', 'We still have to go a long way in all of these programs. In other words, we cannot keep just the same old Model T that we used to have ten years ago.', 'And since I have been down in Washington you have had in Albany a Government which has had to face great problems; but, under the leadership of Governor Lehman, you have had the same kind of forward-looking liberal Government, trying to take care of the great majority of the people, that we have been trying to maintain in Washington.', 'My friends, I am mighty glad to come back into my own home State. It is a pretty fine State to live in.', 'I am quite confident, from all that I have seen and from the great crowds that have come down to meet us, as to what the people of the State of New York are going to say about their two Governments in Albany and in Washington on Tuesday, November third.']",1

In those early days, beginning in 1911, we occupied two different houses at different times in Albany. I was then what might be called a kid Senator. Many years afterwards, after having been in Washington for a while, we came back to this old house; and those four years that we spent here were very happy years for all of our family.', 'We got to know all the people who lived across the street and on each of the side streets, so that we were able to recognize them every time we went in and out of the Executive Mansion. We almost felt as if they had been brought up with us.', 'And now, after four years, there is nothing strange about coming back here to Albany; it is a place that has meant so much in the lives of Mrs. Roosevelt and myself, especially when there are in the Executive Mansion two people of whom we are very, very fond, Governor and Mrs. Lehman.', 'I am inclined to think that Albany agrees with the rest of the State of New York that we cannot afford to have any change in the occupants of the Executive Mansion for the next two years. And I quite frankly am looking forward in the next two years at least, perhaps four years, to coming up to Albany with my wife to spend the day and visit with Herbert Lehman and his wife.', 'We have had a very wonderful trip through the United States these past days. I seem to thrive on ten nights in a sleeping car. And it has been a great lesson to compare the faces of the people today with the faces of the people as they were four years ago.', 'I think we have a happier America; I think we have a better America than we had then; and I believe also that, under the leadership of Governor Lehman, we have a much happier and a much better State of New York.', 'My friends, let me tell you again how happy both Mrs. Roosevelt and I are to come back here tonight and to have this wonderful reception, this truly wonderful homecoming you have given us.

And it is my opinion that there is more downright political intelligence than ever before in our entire history.', 'In a world which in many places has gone undemocratic, we have gone more democratic. It is a bad sign for those who believe that the American people can be swept off their feet by rabble-rousers this year. The American mind today is above the rabble level. Two weeks from today, the day after election, the American air will be cleaner and American democracy will be safer.', 'I want to speak to you briefly and simply about the prosperity of all the Nation, for in that prosperity all New England has an immediate and a direct interest. The golden State House dome symbolizes in itself the preservation of the political unity of the Nation. But New England is heir to the lasting fruits of another great New England tradition—the tradition of being a part in the economic development of the entire Union, and of sharing in all of its prosperity.', 'In the most immediate sense, the problems of the great population of the West and South are your problems too. Their welfare and prosperity are your welfare and prosperity.', ""The sale of New England's shoes depends in part on the price of Kansas' wheat and Georgia's cotton. Prosperity for the California fruit grower depends in part on the prosperity of the New England textile mill. New England savings have prospered in developing Western mines and railroads and stockyards and farms."", 'I have thought much of this interdependence as I have traveled through the great Western country.', 'And I am confident that level-headed New England knows how true that is, knows it in spite of a cantankerous minority that in every difficult time has found spokesmen to try to persuade New England that its interest is not the interest of the rest of the Union. They tell New England today as they have told it before that it has been ruined by Government policies designed to benefit only the rest of the Union.', 'We all know that New England has had its troubles. We all know that New England is coming out of its troubles.', 'If you need figures to prove that, here they are for the State of Massachusetts: Payrolls for the first half of 1936 are up 32 percent over the first half of 1933. Retail sales are up 20 percent. Farm income, excluding benefit payments, is up 37 1/2 percent. Building construction in sixty-two Massachusetts cities is up 100 percent. Does that look to you like the end of private enterprise?', 'For many years under Republican Administrations, New England was handicapped. What were the causes?', 'Every realistic business man of New England knows. First: That New England had established standards of wages and of living which put some of its industries at a competitive disadvantage with sections of the country which had not reached those standards.', 'Second: That those lower standards were exploited by an absentee landlordism which exported from New England too much of its capital—capital that was used elsewhere to compete with industries at home.', 'Third: Concentrated wealth and economic power gobbled up or wiped out or moved away hundreds of small independent New England businesses—the kinds of businesses with which at one time New England had conquered the markets of the world.', 'What did Republican leadership do to meet those difficulties? A high protective tariff alone could not help New England meet the unfair competition from domestic competitors on the one hand, and the unfair competition of monopoly on the other. To make matters worse, that tariff shut off the foreign commerce on which the sea coast population and industrial population of New England had lived.', ""The full fruit of these Republican policies of twelve years is found in the record of what happened to New England's industries under those policies. New England was engulfed by the depression five years before the rest of the country. That is New England's debt to the Republican leadership of the boom era."", 'What has this Administration done?', 'We have raised wages and living standards in other sections of the country. They are being brought up toward the standards of New England. That kind of unfair competition is being destroyed. Most of us are in favor of that.', 'We have begun the first real offensive in our history against that concentrated wealth and monopolistic power which almost destroyed the small businesses and diversified industries of New England. Most of us are in favor of that.', 'By reciprocal trade agreements, we have begun to reopen foreign markets for New England products and New England shipping and trade. Most of us are in favor of that.', ""We have increased the purchasing power of New England's customers out on the farms and in the cities of the Nation. And most of us are in favor of that."", 'New England has traditionally been a land of moderate-sized independent business, a land of economic democracy. Its farseeing statesmen have always understood that democracy was impossible under the relentless pressure of concentration and monopoly wielded by the new power of high finance. The New England Puritan spirit of simplicity, the New England passion for democracy, the New England genius for democratic statescraft, are the very sources of that program of this Administration which set itself to end such concentration of wealth and economic power.', 'Daniel Webster spoke for all that was wisest in New England when he said at Plymouth Rock: ""The freest Government, if it could exist, would not be long acceptable, if the tendency of the laws were to create a rapid accumulation of property in few hands, and to render the great mass of the population dependent and penniless. Universal suffrage could not long exist in a community where there was great inequality of property.""', 'What have we done in our fight against monopolies?', ""We have taxed the intercorporate dividends of holding companies. We have graduated taxes on corporations according to income, just as taxes on individuals were graduated long ago. We have made it harder for big corporations to retain the huge undistributed profits with which they gobble up small business. We have raised the surtaxes on big incomes and the estate taxes on big fortunes. We have regulated the financial markets through which mergers and consolidations and monopolies are created with other people's money."", 'Way back in 1776 John Adams wrote to his friend Patrick Henry:', '""The decree is gone forth, and it cannot be recalled, that a more equal liberty than has prevailed in other parts of the earth, must be established in America. The exuberance of pride which has produced an insolent domination in a few, a very few, opulent monopolizing families, will be brought down nearer to the confines of reason and moderation, than they have been used to.""', 'I am glad to travel in the company of John Adams and Daniel Webster.

Roosevelt ,"October 21, 1936","['Senator Walsh, Governor Curley, Mayor Sullivan, and my friends of New England:', 'I am glad to be in New England—New England from which have come most of my forebears. In recent weeks I have traveled through a great part of the United States. I have spoken about farming and mining and livestock, about business big and little, about the wage earner, about the national debt, about drought and flood, about work for the needy unemployed and about security— security for our people and for their homes.', 'I have found a Nation more greatly prosperous, more definitely on the highway to complete recovery than at any time in the past seven years. I have seen the record of what we have done in the faces of the people I have met. We have banished Old Man Gloom.', 'It has taken only one day of driving through Rhode Island and Massachusetts to prove to me that New England is in step and on the march with the rest of the Nation.', 'I have seen things today even more welcome to me than your lovely autumn foliage. I have seen the smoke from factories which three and a half years ago were smokeless. I have heard the sound of mills which three and a half years ago were silent. I have seen men at work who three and a half years ago were jobless. I have seen women and children who, after long years of fear, have begun to live and hope again.', 'Three and a half years ago we declared war on the depression. You and I know today that that war is being won.', 'But now comes that familiar figure—the well-upholstered hindsight critic. He tells us that our strategy was wrong, that the cost was too great, that something else won the war. That is an argument as old as the remorse of those who had their chance and muffed it. It is as recent as the claims of those who say that they could have done better.', 'You may remember the First Battle of the Marne in the World War. Almost everybody thought that it was Marshal Joffre who had won it. But some refused to agree. One day, a newspaperman appealed to Marshal Joffre: ""Will you tell me who did win the Battle of the Marne?"" ""I can\'t answer that,"" said the Marshal. ""But I can tell you that if the Battle of the Marne had been lost the blame would have been on me.""', 'Our war, too—this war we are now finishing- had to be won. No price, we were told then, was too high to pay to win it. We did count the cost. But in the barrage that we laid down against the depression we could not stop firing to haggle about the price of every shell. We kept on firing and fighting. The important thing is that the war is being won.', 'Without that victory we cannot have the kind of America we know and love and want our children to live in.', 'New England, as one of the senior partners in the company of the States, has always stood for two of the fundamentals of American liberty: the Town Meeting, with its essential insistence on local control over local affairs, and the doctrine for which Sam Adams and his friends were willing to fight— the doctrine of democracy in taxation. While I do not happen to be a cousin of the distinguished Adams family, I consider myself, politically, a lineal descendant of old Sam.', 'In 1776 the fight was for democracy in taxation. In 1936 that is still the fight. Mr. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once said: ""Taxes are the price we pay for civilized society."" One sure way to determine the social conscience of a Government is to examine the way taxes are collected and how they are spent. And one sure way to determine the social conscience of an individual is to get his tax-reaction.', 'Taxes, after all, are the dues that we pay for the privileges of membership in an organized society.', 'As society becomes more civilized, Government—national, State and local government—is called on to assume more obligations to its citizens. The privileges of membership in a civilized society have vastly increased in modern times. But I am afraid we have many who still do not recognize their advantages and want to avoid paying their dues.', 'It is only in the past two generations that most local communities have paved and lighted their streets, put in town sewers, provided town water supplies, organized fire departments, established high schools and public libraries, created parks and playgrounds—undertaken, in short, all kinds of necessary new activities which, perforce, had to be paid for out of local taxes.', 'And let me at this point note that in this most amazing of campaigns, I have found sections of the Nation where Republican leaders were actually whispering the word to the owners of homes and farms that the present Federal Administration proposed to make a cash levy on local real estate to pay off the national debt. They know that the Federal Government does not tax real estate, that it cannot tax real estate. If they do not know that, I suggest they read the Constitution of the United States to find out.', 'New obligations to their citizens have also been assumed by the several States and by the Federal Government, obligations unknown a century and a half ago, but made necessary by new inventions and by a constantly growing social conscience.', 'The easiest way to summarize the reason for this extension of Government functions, local, State and national, is to use the words of Abraham Lincoln: ""The legitimate object of Government is to do for the people what needs to be done but which they cannot by individual effort do at all, or do so well, for themselves.""', 'Taxes are the price we all pay collectively to get those things done.', 'To divide fairly among the people the obligation to pay for these benefits has been a major part of our struggle to maintain democracy in America.', 'Ever since 1776 that struggle has been between two forces. On the one hand, there has been the vast majority of our citizens who believed that the benefits of democracy should be extended and who were willing to pay their fair share to extend them. On the other hand, there has been a small, but powerful group which has fought the extension of those benefits, because it did not want to pay a fair share of their cost.', 'That was the line-up in 1776. That is the line-up in this campaign. And I am confident that once more—in 1936—democracy in taxation will win.', 'Here is my principle: Taxes shall be levied according to ability to pay. That is the only American principle.', 'Before this great war against the depression we fought the World War; and it cost us twenty-five billion dollars in three years to win it. We borrowed to fight that war. Then, as now, a Democratic Administration provided sufficient taxes to pay off the entire war debt within ten or fifteen years.', 'Those taxes had been levied according to ability to pay. But the succeeding Republican Administration did not believe in that principle. There was a reason. They had political debts to those who sat at their elbows. To pay those political debts, they reduced the taxes of their friends in the higher brackets and left the national debt to be paid by later generations. Because they evaded their obligation, because they regarded the political debt as more important than the national debt, the depression in 1929 started with a sixteen-billion-dollar handicap on us and our children.', ""Now let's keep this little drama straight. The actors are the same. But the act is different. Today their role calls for stage tears about the next generation. But in the days after the World War they played a different part."", ""The moral of the play is clear. They got out from under then, they would get out from under now—if their friends could get back into power and they could get back to the driver's seat. But neither you nor I think that they are going to get back."", 'As in the World War, we have again created a tax structure to yield revenues adequate to pay the cost of this war against depression in this generation and not in the next.', 'New or increased taxes are not needed to enable us to balance the Federal Budget and to begin very soon a rapid reduction in the national debt. Recovery is with us. Federal revenues are increasing; emergency expenditures are decreasing. A balanced budget is on the way. Does that sound like bankruptcy to you?', 'Why this increase in Government revenues? Because the taxpayer earns more money and spends more money. Though he pays more money in taxes, he has more money left for himself and for his family.', 'For the average American we have reduced the individual income tax. Any family head who earns an income of less than $26,000 a year pays a smaller income tax in 1936 than he paid for 1932. That means that less than one percent of the heads of American families pay more than they did; and more than 99 percent pay less than they did, for more than 99 percent earn less than $26,000 per year. If you want the answer to this talk about high taxes under this Administration—there it is. Taxes are higher for those who can afford to pay high taxes. They are lower for those who can afford to pay less. That is getting back again to the American principle—taxation according to ability to pay.', 'You would think, to hear some people talk, that those good people who live at the top of our economic pyramid are being taxed into rags and tatters. What is the fact? The fact is that they are much farther away from the poorhouse than they were in 1932. You and I know that as a matter of personal observation.', 'A number of my friends who belong in these very high upper brackets have suggested to me, more in sorrow than in anger, that if I am reelected they will have to move to some other Nation because of high taxes here. I shall miss them very much but if they go they will soon come back. For a year or two of paying taxes in almost any other country in the world will make them yearn once more for the good old taxes of the U.S.A.', 'One more word on recent history. I inherited from the previous Administration a tax structure which not only imposed an unfair income tax burden on the low-income groups of this country, but also imposed an unfair burden upon the average American by a long list of taxes on purchases and consumption- hidden taxes.', 'In 1933 when we came into office, fifty-eight cents out of every dollar of Federal revenue came from hidden taxes. Leaving out of account the liquor tax—for liquor was illegal in 1933—we have reduced these indirect taxes to thirty-eight cents out of every dollar.', 'How else have we improved and Americanized the tax structure?', ""First, we gave a credit to earned income- that is, income from personal work or service- thus substantially reducing taxes paid by the working citizen. Wasn't that the American thing to do?"", ""Second, we decreased the tax rates on small corporations. Wasn't that the American thing to do?"", ""Third, we increased the taxes paid by individuals in the higher brackets—those of incomes over $50,000 a year. Wasn't that the American thing to do?"", ""Fourth, we increased still further the taxes paid by individuals in the highest brackets—those with incomes over one million dollars a year. Wasn't that the American thing to do?"", ""Fifth, we increased the tax on very large estates. Wasn't that the American thing to do?"", 'Finally, this year we had to find new revenues to meet the immediate bonus payments and to take the place of the processing taxes. This new tax, called the undistributed profits tax, is merely an extension of the individual income tax law and a plugging-up of the loopholes in it, loopholes which could be used only by men of very large incomes.', 'I want to say a word to you average investors and stockholders who are being flooded by propaganda about this tax—propaganda, incidentally, paid for by your money. It is being disseminated by those who have used corporations in the past to build up their own economic power, who seek, by holding back your dividends, to keep down their taxes.', 'It is a fact that 98.5 percent of all American corporations will pay a smaller normal corporation tax under the new law.', 'It is a fact that the law permits corporations to expand and build up adequate reserves.', 'But for the first time it gives the stockholder a practical chance to determine for himself whether to keep his earnings in the corporation for expansion purposes or to take them out. He is now the one—not the board of directors—to choose between using his dividends for something else and reinvesting them in the stock of the corporation.', 'What we are concerned with primarily is principle, and the principle of this law is sound. If in its application imperfections are discovered, they must be corrected for the good of American business.', 'I am certain that the average of our citizenship is not taken in by the amazing amount of other tax misinformation which has been turned loose in this political campaign.', ""People tell you there are fifty-eight taxes on a loaf of bread, or sixty-three taxes on a lady's coat. But stop, look and listen. You will find what the propagandists do not tell you: only two or three of all of them are Federal taxes imposed by the national Government. All the rest are imposed by local, town, county, city, district and State Governments. Two-thirds of all the taxes paid in America are State and local taxes, not Federal taxes."", 'This Administration has had something to do with these local taxes. It has made them easier to bear. At the request of local and State Governments for whom the local burden had become too heavy, we in Washington assumed the cost of paying in greater part for work for the needy unemployed. And, by a national fiscal policy aimed at reducing interest rates throughout the Nation we have greatly lightened the burden of carrying local government debts, helping those of you who own homes and farms or who pay rent.', ""I want to say a word also to the wage earners who are finding propaganda about the security tax in their pay envelopes. I want to remind them that the new social security law was designed for them, for the greater safety of their homes and their families. The fund necessary to provide that security is not collected solely from workers. The employer, too, pays an equal share. And both shares—yours and the employer's—are being held for the sole benefit of the worker himself."", 'I have spoken in Chicago and elsewhere of the simple fact that the overwhelming majority of business men are like the rest of us. Most of us whether we earn wages, run farms or run businesses are in one sense business men. All they seek and all we seek is fair play based on the greater good of the greater number—fair play on the part of the Government in levying taxes on us and fair play on the part of Government in protecting us against abuses.', ""Once more this year we must choose between democracy in taxation and special privilege in taxation. Are you willing to turn the control of the Nation's taxes back to special privilege? I know the American answer to that question. Your pay envelope may be loaded with suggestions of fear, and your dividend letter may be filled with propaganda. But the American people will be neither bluffed nor bludgeoned."", 'The seeds of fear cannot bear fruit in the polling booth.', 'Inside the polling booth every American man and woman stands as the equal of every other American man and woman. There they have no superiors. There they have no masters save their own minds and consciences. There they are sovereign American citizens. There on November 3d they will not fear to exercise that sovereignty.']",1

And I remember also that Rhode Island is a very important part of the United States, for around me lies the most highly industrial and densely populated State in the Union.', 'I could speak to no people who better understand the interdependence of modern economic life.', 'I have said that what the present national Administration has tried to do was to adjust statecraft to reality— the reality of forty-eight States which have agreed to live together in a machine age.', 'When this Administration came to Washington on the fourth of March, 1933, the machine of our national economy had completely broken down. For twelve long years it had been neglected by those who believed that machines did not need tending. We tried to rebuild that machine, to modernize it and to turn on the purchasing power.', 'It was the biggest peacetime job ever attempted. It called for energy in a hundred directions at once, it called for imagination and for willingness to face facts.', 'Because it was a modern machine it needed money in circulation to get it going and keep it going. Therefore, we had to obtain purchasing power for the farmer, work for the unemployed, loans to industry, safety and courage for banks.', 'How much did we spend? Enough to get results—enough to be sure not to fail. There would have been no second chance if we had failed once.', 'You and I are used to venturing capital to gain profits. And in these three and a half years our venture has succeeded.', 'Prosperity measured in dollars is coming back. There is none among you to deny it. But there is a higher measure for prosperity: the measure of permanency, the measure of security.', 'We seek not the prosperity of 1929 but the kind which will mean to every American family an assurance of safety of the home, safety of old age, safety of savings, safety of employment.', 'You have been talked to about regimentation. I am opposed to the kind of regimentation under which you labored and suffered in the days of the false prosperity and in the days of the great depression.', 'We believe that people are even more important than machines. We believe that the material resources of America should serve the human resources of America.', 'We will not again allow people to be regimented by selfish minorities into bankruptcies and breadlines.', 'I wish that on this visit I might stay longer. But I know Rhode Island, its cities, its farms, its waters and its valleys.

No one could fail to be inspired by this wonderful sight before me—tens of thousands of men, women and children. All of you are taking more of an interest in the problems of Government and the future of the country than at any time before in our American history.', 'I am here in a twofold capacity. I am here as President to talk with your Governor and your State officials, your Congressmen and your Senators, in regard to the problems of floods. And I am here also, I am told, as a candidate for a high public office.', 'My friend Tom Spellacy has told me that where I am standing today, at this moment, the water would have been up around my hips if I had been here at the time of the great flood.', 'I think that we can get a little lesson out of that flood—a lesson relating to Government, to the reason why your Government in Washington has to keep in close touch with the Governments of the States and of the cities of the Nation, and why, under certain circumstances, the Government at Washington has to step in to help.', 'This river of yours goes through four States—Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut. A large part of the flood waters that came upon you recently had their origin in some other State. No matter what you do in Connecticut, no matter how many dikes you build, no matter how many precautions you take, unless the floods are controlled at the source of the river, your work will be in vain. That is why the problem of floods involves more than one State.', 'There are two approaches to the solution of that problem: The first is by the method of cooperation between States—the interstate compact method—and I am glad to say that these States of New England are working together, planning for the control of floods. But, my friends, that method is insufficient in itself. You cannot ask the State of Vermont, for example, to pay the entire cost of controlling the flood waters that flow through Vermont. The chief benefit is going to be not to Vermont, but to Massachusetts and Connecticut. And so you come to the second approach to the problem—the duty of the Federal Government to control the waters of navigable rivers. You know that your Federal Government stands ready today to do its full share toward flood prevention in the future.', 'It is a happier Connecticut that I come back to than the Connecticut I saw in 1932.', 'I do not particularly like figures and neither do you, but just listen for one minute.', 'In this State, employment in the City of Hartford alone is 45 percent greater this year than it was in 1932. Aggregate payrolls are 82 percent greater than they were in the spring of 1933. Twenty-three thousand workers have been reemployed by private industry and payrolls are running at the rate of forty-four million dollars a year more than before recovery began. Building construction is up four times what it was in those days, and the retail stores are selling 28 percent more merchandise than they sold then.', 'And because Connecticut, like the State of New York, is also an agricultural State, let me point out to you that the value of the farm products in your State—I mean the money actually received by the farmers of the State—has gone up somewhere between 30 and 40 percent.', 'And let me point out to you that, as we take stock, we are thinking not only of our own city, not only of our own State, not only of the region of States in which we live, but we are thinking about the Nation as a whole. For we realize that the prosperity of the West is reflected in the prosperity of the East, and that, unless the cotton farmer of the South can get a fair price for his cotton, he will be unable to buy the manufactured products of New England.', 'That is the lesson that we have learned these past three years, and that is why your Administration in Washington has been thinking about the return of prosperity in terms of the whole Nation and not just in terms of any one part of the Nation. And, my friends, I regard the State of Connecticut as a very integral part of the Nation.', 'I am glad that prosperity is back with us again and, believe me, it is going to stay.', 'And I know that on the third of November, some time in the evening, I am going to get a telegram from Wilbur Cross and a lot of my old friends here, telling me that the State of Connecticut is in the Democratic column.']",1

I can tell you very simply that I do not believe I have ever seen her made more happy in all her life than when this park was named after her. And it is something that I also shall always remember, and my children and my grandchildren in the years to come.', 'I have just come from the ceremonies at the Statue of Liberty. I suggested there that we should rededicate that Statue not to liberty alone but also to peace. I spoke there of the steady stream of human resources which the Old World poured on our shores and out of which our American civilization has been built.', 'Many of the people who came past the Statue of Liberty settled in this section of New York City. Here they wove into the pattern of American life some of the color, some of the richness of the cultures from which they came. Here they joined in that great process out of which we have welded our American citizenship. We gave them freedom. I am proud—America is proud—of what they have given to us.', 'They have never been—they are not now—half-hearted Americans. In Americanization classes and at night schools they have burned the midnight oil in order to be worthy of their new allegiance.', 'They were not satisfied merely to find here the realization of the material hopes which had guided them from their native land. They were not satisfied merely to build a material home for themselves and their families.', 'They were intent also upon building a place for themselves in the ideals of America. They sought an assurance of permanency in the new land for themselves and their children based upon active participation in its civilization and culture.', 'Those who have come here of late understand and appreciate our free institutions and our free opportunity, as well as those who have been here for many generations. The great majority of the new and the old do not confuse the word ""liberty"" with the word ""license."" They appreciate that the American standard of freedom does not include the right to do things which hurt their neighbors. All of us, old-comers and new-comers, agree that for the speculator to gamble with and lose the savings of the clients of his bank is just as contrary to American ideals of liberty as it is for the poor man to upset the peddler\'s cart and steal his wares. To our newer Americans America is a great discovery. They who have never been so free before rejoice in our freedom. Our liberty is warmed by the fire of their devotion.', 'I am inclined to think that in some cases the newer citizens have discharged their obligations to us better than we have discharged our obligations to them. For example, their coming helped to intensify the housing problem in many of our great cities. We have not yet worked out an adequate answer to that problem.', 'As a matter of fact, we have, for too long, neglected the housing problem for all our lower-income groups. We have spent large sums of money on parks, on highways, on bridges, on museums, and on other projects of civic betterment. For the most part that was money well spent. But we have not yet begun adequately to spend money in order to help the families in the overcrowded sections of our cities to live as American citizens have a right to live.', 'You and I will not be content until City, State and Federal Governments join with private capital in helping every American family to live that way.', 'We need action to get better city housing. Senator Wagner and I had hoped for a new law at the last session of the Congress. We who believe in better housing have not been defeated. I am confident that the next Congress will start us on our way with a sound housing policy. We shall certainly get it if on November 3d you vote. to send to Washington the kind of Government which I am confident you want—a Government which will continue to work for security of the home, for security of jobs, for security of savings, and for better homes in every part of the Nation.', 'My friends, let me thank you for this greeting that you have given me. It has been a wonderful day in my life, and I am going to end my speech now by cutting this cake.']",1
47,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"October 29, 1936","['My friends of Pennsylvania:', 'When I found that I was to speak in Harrisburg today, and realized that it is John Mitchell Day, I determined to come by way of Wilkes-Barre. I wanted to pay my tribute to him, whom I was happy and proud to call my friend.', ""In 1913 I was Assistant Secretary of the Navy. I was asked at that time to examine charges of collusion in coal bids for the Navy. I needed help from someone whose integrity and knowledge I could trust. I recalled then how impressed Theodore Roosevelt had been with John Mitchell's handling of the great coal strike of 1902. I asked John Mitchell to help me. In three days he taught me a great deal about coal and mining. What he taught me saved the United States Navy many hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in its coal bill."", 'You in this anthracite region and miners in every other coal field in the United States have a fuller picture of this man who was one of the most significant figures in American labor history. For many years he went about the unspectacular but very necessary job of clearing the ground for the progress of a great labor movement. He taught a dispersed industry how to organize. He taught both management and labor that the only basis for stability is to be found in, contracts that can and will be lived up to by both management and labor.', 'By victory in the first great battle of the mine workers he broke the tradition of defeat which had always hung over the aspirations of those he led. He convinced the public that the gains of labor were the gains of all, that the labor movement was something to be welcomed rather than feared. He made public opinion a judge to which labor could more confidently appeal. His work was necessary before other men could do theirs.', 'We now build upon the work of John Mitchell. He pioneered in his day for collective bargaining. Today we have put upon the Federal statute books the legal mechanism to make collective bargaining a reality.', 'He pioneered in his day for the education of the public. Today we aim to make the public conscious that the welfare of labor is the welfare of all.', 'Carrying forward his work and that of others like him, we have begun to build a system of old-age pensions and unemployment insurance to substitute for uncertainty a new security in the life of the wage earner and his family.', 'How far we have come is shown by the patriotic resentment with which labor and the public alike are meeting the latest attempts of a handful of employers, politicians, and newspapers to mislead and coerce labor with regard to the Social Security Act. Here is repetition of the arrogance and the ruthlessness which the operators utilized to try to break the solid ranks of labor when the miners fought at Armageddon in 1902, more than thirty years ago.', 'No employer has a right to put his political preferences in the pay envelope. That is coercion even if he tells the whole truth.', 'But this propaganda misrepresents by telling only half the truth. Labor and a fair-minded public must place such tactics in a class with the coercion of the strong-arm squad and the whispering of the planted labor spy.', 'This pay-envelope propaganda has one clear objective—to sabotage the Social Security Act. To sabotage that Act is to sabotage labor. For that Act, as you know, was worked out with labor and enacted with the active support of labor— all kinds of labor.', 'Why do these employers seek to repeal the Social Security Act? Because under the Act they have to pay far more than half of the insurance given to the workers.', 'Get these facts straight.', 'The Act provides for two kinds of insurance for the worker.', 'For that insurance both the employer and the worker pay premiums, just as you pay premiums on any other insurance policy. Those premiums are collected in the form of the taxes you hear so much about.', 'The first kind of insurance covers old age. Here the employer contributes one dollar of premium for every dollar of premium contributed by the worker; but both dollars are held by the Government solely for the benefit of the worker in his old age.', 'In effect, we have set up a savings account for the old age of the worker. Because the employer is called upon to contribute on a fifty-fifty basis, that savings account gives exactly two dollars of security for every dollar put up by the worker.', 'The second kind of insurance is unemployment insurance to help the worker and his family over the difficult days when he loses his job. For the unemployment security of the worker, the employer under the Federal law puts up the entire premium- two dollars. The benefits of this insurance go 100 percent to the worker, none to the employer. But the premiums for this unemployment insurance so far as the Federal Government is concerned are paid 100 percent by the employer.', ""Now let's add it all up. Beginning January first, for every one dollar which the worker is asked to put into an old-age account for himself, employers are required under the Federal Act to contribute three dollars to protect the worker from both unemployment and old age. That is, the worker contributes only one dollar to his old age security; he contributes nothing to his security against losing his job. But at the same time the employer has to put up two dollars for unemployment and one dollar for old age."", ""Three for one! There's the rub. That is what these propaganda-spreading employers object to. The record extending back several years shows that their purpose has always been to compel the workers alone to put up all the premiums both for their unemployment insurance and their old-age insurance. They are now trying to frighten the workers about the workers' one-dollar premium, so that they won't have to pay their three-dollar premium."", 'These propagandists—with allies whom I do not have to describe to you who know them- are driven in their desperation to the contemptible, unpatriotic suggestion that some future Congress will steal these insurance funds for other purposes. If they really believe what they say in the pay envelopes, they have no confidence in our form of government or its permanence. It might be well for them to move to some other Nation in which they have greater faith.', 'I know that American workers made wise as well as strong by the achievements of John Mitchell and his successors will not be fooled by this campaign any more than they were frightened by the strong-arm squads of the past.', 'John Mitchell taught labor that to win and to preserve the fruits of its victories, it must have a cool head as well as a warm heart. I know that labor will refuse to be robbed of its gains, that the progress begun by its friends will be safeguarded and carried forward, until the fuller security that is its right is won.']",1
48,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"October 29, 1936","['My friends of Pennsylvania:', 'Pennsylvania is at once a great industrial State, a great commercial State, a great mining State and a great agricultural State.', ""The Pennsylvania farmer, unlike the farmer in the West, can see his own city market within a few hours' drive, just as my neighbor farmers in the Hudson River Valley. And the Pennsylvania industrial worker and merchant know how important to their prosperity is the prosperity of their neighbors, the farmers."", 'Pennsylvania rightly calls itself the Keystone State. Great tides of immigration have swept through it. Great routes of commerce have crossed it from the very beginning—famous wagon-roads and railroads and water routes from the East to the West and the North to the South and back again. Pennsylvania knows that American commerce transcends State lines and becomes interstate and international.', 'But because Pennsylvania has these great problems of commerce and of industry it has, also, great human problems—and those are the problems with which you and I are most deeply concerned.', 'The machine age has served well the men and women who use its excellent products. The new problem is to see to it that the machine age serves equally well the men and women who run its machines.', 'That is a problem not for Pennsylvania alone, not even for industry alone. It is a problem for the Nation, and for all kinds of enterprise within the Nation. If modern Government is to justify itself, it must see to it that human values are not mangled and destroyed.', 'You and I know that that is sound morality and good religion. You and I know that it is also good business.', 'The simple fact of our dependence upon each other was either unknown or entirely ignored by the Republican leaders of the post-war period. Their doctrine was to give definite help at the top and to utter pious hopes for the bottom. Twelve years of that brought the inevitable crash.', 'When we came to Washington in 1933 it was our fundamental belief that faith without works is dead. We acted—not for a few of us but for all of us. That program worked.', 'But I am very much afraid that the Republican leadership is still the same. It still preaches the same heresy—class against class and region against region.', 'You do not need me to tell you this. They say it themselves, loudly. There are dozens of examples—but just take one. They are using it, for example, in what they call their market-basket campaign.', 'In the cities they make promises which they are careful to hide from the farmers. In the rural districts they make promises which they are careful to hide from the city dwellers. In the cities they promise to reduce food prices for the woman who carries the market-basket. In the country they promise to raise food prices for the man who grows the contents of that market-basket on the farm.', 'Now is that not a nice fairy story? You and I know that you cannot eat your cake in the city and have your cake on the farm. You and I know that after twelve years of that policy there was no cake, and there was very little bread. The American people are through with that kind of emptiness.', ""The prices of farm products have risen since 1932. It's a good thing for all of us that they have risen. We set out deliberately to raise them. It was their rise that helped to start all of us on the road to recovery again. Every home in America has benefited by that."", ""The prices the farmer was receiving in 1932 were so low that he had no cash income to buy industrial goods made in the cities. That threw people out of work in the cities. Today the farm's products bring more to the farmer. Here in Pennsylvania, for instance, cash income from farm production was 47 percent higher in 1935 than in 1932. That is typical of what has happened to farmers throughout the East and throughout the Nation. The farmer is able to buy more from the city. That means more people are at work in the cities, and that in turn means that the city dwellers buy more farm produce."", ""That is why the consumer's pocketbook has filled up faster than the price of food has gone up. The housewife pays more money for what she buys, but she has more money to buy it with, and she has more money left over after she has bought. Nationwide facts and figures prove this. Let us take a look at these figures. From 1929 to 1932 food prices in the United States dropped 35 percent, but understand this: factory payrolls in the same period went down 58 percent. That made a large hole in the workers' market-basket."", 'The average city family paid less for what it bought in those years. But that family had still less with which to buy.', 'Some retail food prices have risen higher than others. Other food prices have advanced very little. To be fair you have to strike an average. The average advance of food costs since 1932 is 24 percent, a quarter more than they were four years ago.', 'But compare that— again using average figures for the country —with the factory payrolls. These have gone up since the spring of 1933, not 24 percent but 77 percent. And if you take the average of all city dwellers, their incomes have gone up faster and farther than food prices have gone up. To sum up: the Republican market-basket of 1932 cost less but the American consumer did not have the cash to fill it. Our market-basket in 1936 has much in it because people have money in their pockets to fill it with.', 'It is true that there is often too wide a spread between what the farmer gets and what the consumer pays. For that neither the farmer nor the consumer is responsible, and both the farmer and the consumer suffer.', 'We are engaged very definitely in seeking to solve that difficulty. First, we are vigilant and on guard against monopolies which are contrary to sound public policy even though they are not actually illegal. Second, we are seeking new means to eliminate waste and unnecessary duplication in distributing the food supply of the Nation, to benefit both producer and consumer.', 'Through twelve years the Republicans proved that sectionalism will not work. We have proved in three and a half years that interdependence and unity will work.', 'Giving the farmer of Dauphin or Lancaster County a good break has given a good break to the steel worker of Pittsburgh, the coal miner of Scranton, the white-collar or factory worker of Philadelphia. And giving California, Minnesota and Texas a good break gives a good break to Pennsylvania, Ohio and New Jersey.', 'Ours has been a program of one for all and all for one. That doctrine has given us recovery. Continuing that practice will continue recovery.', 'You all remember that good old Republican slogan that was trotted out and polished up for every political campaign—the slogan of ""the full dinner pail."" And we know that the Republican leaders themselves were responsible for its sad end. Down to 1933, the full dinner pail turned out to be the empty market basket.', 'I know that the American people will not return to power those leaders who emptied the national market-basket. I know that the American people will go forward with those who are succeeding in filling it once more.']",1
49,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"October 29, 1936","['Mr. Mayor, my friends of Camden:', 'I am very, very grateful to you and to your City Government for naming this plaza in my honor. It is not very long ago that I read that some of the Federal funds intended for work relief were to be used to transform the plaza into a beautiful park; and it was suggested at that time that here is one case where grass has been made to grow in the city streets. (Laughter)', 'I have come to Camden today for one perfectly valid reason: it is the principal city of Southern New Jersey, and, so far as I recollect in a somewhat varied experience, I have never made a speech here before.', 'Because Camden is a good cross-section of many different types of people who earn their living—commuters, white-collar workers, factory workers, and shipyard workers—I want to say a few words about a subject which affects every one of you—your own lives and the lives of your families—the subject of human security.', 'We have heard much about it during the last three and a half years for the very simple reason that the Nation has needed human security. We have needed it for the farmer and for the city dweller alike.', 'You who work in offices or factories or shipyards are hit when business slumps. Your future is tied up with the stability of the business in which you work.', 'Holding on to a job in these past few years was not the only problem you faced. You had to think of your families. You had to think of your homes. You had to think of the savings in the bank. You had to think about your modest investments and your insurance policies, and your mortgage payments. None of these things was safe in those days.', 'Today things are very different. Business of all kinds has begun to get in the clear. You know that your jobs are safer, that there are more jobs to go around and better pay for jobs. The threat to your savings, your investments, your insurance policies and your homes is being removed.', 'None of this came by chance. It came because your Government refused to leave it to chance. It came because your Administration thought things through—thought of things as a whole -planned a balanced national economy and acted in a score of ways to bring it to pass. Today I want to mention only two examples out of many.', 'First, your savings. We did not leave them to chance. Today for the first time your deposits in every national bank and in eight thousand State banks throughout the country are insured up to five thousand dollars—a total of forty-nine million accounts. In other words, 98 1/2 percent of all bank accounts in these banks are insured. Never in all our history have we had as sound a banking structure as today. And I doubt very much if any of you will vote to go back to the unsafe banking conditions of 1932.', 'And once more, I remind the Nation that this month of October marks the end of one whole year in which there was not a single national bank failure—the first twelve-month period in fifty-five years that was free from such failures.', 'The other example I want to say a word about relates to the stability of what you and I call values. For twelve years before this Administration came into office, values of almost every kind of property were running up and down the scale like the mercury in a thermometer on a March day. Raw material prices were varying 400 and 500 and 600 percent. Real estate was alternately booming and collapsing.', 'As a result, the assets behind everything you and I owned were better one month and poorer the next. Bankers did not know what their portfolios would be worth from one month to the next. Commercial concerns had no assurance of the value of their bills receivable. Contractors could make only wild guesses in submitting their bids. Many stocks and bonds were worth crazy prices one month and very little the next.', 'After the crash, and after the long years of despair which followed it, one prayer went up from the American people—they wanted something to tie to—they sought stability because they knew that without stability they could not have security.', 'It has been our aim first of all to restore values to a normal and proper level. It is our aim to maintain them at a normal and proper level. In that way we believe there will be a greater security for the average American family no matter what may be the occupation of the members of that family.', 'My friends, today in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, I spoke very briefly in regard to the great Social Security Law which goes into effect next year. I spoke about those few business concerns and those few newspapers which are spreading false rumors in regard to this far-reaching Act. I told the people of Pennsylvania that for every dollar which the worker is asked to put into the fund under this law as a premium of insurance against old age, the employer is required to put in another dollar. And for the other form of insurance in the Act—unemployment insurance- the premium is paid solely by the employer and not by the worker. In other words, for the insurance which you get, you people are going to pay one dollar of premium and your employers are going to pay three dollars. Three to one, there is the rub! That is what the propaganda mongers really object to. Not satisfied with that, they are endeavoring to spread the unpatriotic suggestion that some future Congress may steal these insurance funds for other purposes.', 'And if these employers really believe what they are saying in their propaganda spread in pay envelopes, it proves that they have no confidence in our form of government. I suggest to them that it might be well for them to move to some other Nation in which they have a greater faith.', 'Your Administration has as its great objectives for all our citizens, in the cities and on the farms, in the West, in the South and in the East—greater permanence for employment, safety for earnings, protection for the home and a better security for the average man and his family. Those objectives can and will be attained. You and I are going to carry on until they are.']",1

Roosevelt ,"October 29, 1936","['Save for my own home State of New York, this meeting in Wilmington marks the close of my campaign for the Presidency.', 'It seems appropriate that on this occasion I should make no political speech, because I can better describe the kind of liberty which our Administration has sought and continues to seek by reading to you the simple words of a great President who believed in the kind of liberty that we believe in—the great President who preserved the American Union.', 'These words are from the speech made by President Abraham Lincoln at the Sanitary Fair in Baltimore in 1864. And I ask that you good people give heed to these words for, although they are three-quarters of a century old, yet I think you will find that they apply to 1936. Abraham Lincoln said this:', '""The world has never had a good definition of the word liberty, and the American people, just now, are much in want of one. We all declare for liberty; but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing. With some the word liberty may mean for each man to do as he pleases with himself, and the product of his labor; while with others the same word may mean for some men to do as they please with other men, and the product of other men\'s labor. Here are two, not only \'different, but incompatible things, called by the same name, liberty. And it follows that each of the things is, by the respective parties, called by two different and incompatible names—liberty and tyranny.""', 'And then Abraham Lincoln used this homely example. He said:', '""The shepherd drives the wolf from the sheep\'s throat, for which the sheep thanks the shepherd as his liberator, while the wolf denounces him for the same act, as the destroyer of liberty. . . . Plainly, the sheep and the wolf are not agreed upon a definition of the word liberty; and precisely the same difference prevails today among us human creatures . . . and all professing to love liberty. Hence we behold the process by which thousands are daily passing from under the yoke of bondage hailed by some as the advance of liberty, and bewailed by others as the destruction of all liberty."" And, in closing, Lincoln said this:', '""Recently, as it seems, the people . . . have been doing something to define liberty, and thanks to them that, in what they have done, the wolf\'s dictionary has been repudiated.""', ""My friends, today, in 1936, the people have again been doing something to define liberty. And the wolf's dictionary has again been repudiated."", 'What Abraham Lincoln said three-quarters of a century ago applies today as it did then. The people, men and women, of the City of Wilmington and the State of Delaware will, I think, appreciate their significance in the same measure as men and women in every other part of the Union.', 'And that is why, my friends, on Tuesday evening next I expect to get a message from the State of Delaware telling me that all is well.']",1

I could talk to you for hours about this better, happier America. What I am going to talk to you about for a few minutes, however, is some of the things that have brought about that better, happier America. I want to tell you in terms of actual achievement what we in Washington have done, what we have done to restore prosperity, what we have done to end abuses.', 'The first thing before us on that famous fourth of March, 1933, was to give aid to those overtaken by disaster. We did that, and we are not ashamed of giving help to those who needed help. We furnished food relief, drought relief, flood relief, work relief. We established the Federal Emergency Relief Administration; the Public Works Administration; the Civilian Conservation Corps; the Works Progress Administration. Some people ridicule them as alphabetical agencies. But you and I know that they are the agencies that have substituted food for starvation; work for idleness; hope instead of dull despair.', 'And on November 3d, America will say that that was a job well done!', 'The second thing we did was to help our stalled economic engine to get under way again. We knew enough about the mechanism of our economic order to know that we could not do that one wheel at a time. We had had enough of one-wheel economics. We proposed to get all four wheels started at once. We knew that it was no good to try to start only the wheel of finance. At the same time we had to start the wheels of agriculture, of workers of all classes, of business and industry.', 'By democratizing the work of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and redirecting it into more practical and helpful channels we furnished fuel for the machine.', 'We primed the pump by spending Government money in direct relief, in work relief, in public works.', 'We established the Agricultural Adjustment Administration; the National Recovery Administration; the Farm Credit Administration; the Soil Conservation Program; the Home Owners Loan Corporation; the Federal Housing Administration; the Tennessee Valley Authority; the Resettlement Administration; the Rural Electrification Administration. We set up a sound monetary policy; a sound banking structure; reciprocal trade agreements; foreign exchange accords.', ""We created a National Labor Relations Board to improve working conditions and seek industrial peace. We brought the business men of the Nation together to encourage them to increase wages, to shorten working hours, to abolish child labor. With labor's aid and backing we took the first great step for workers' security by the Social Security Act— an act which is now being misrepresented to the workers in a pay-envelope propaganda by a few employers whom you will easily recognize as old time exploiters of labor who have always fought against contributing anything themselves to a sound security for the laboring man and his wife and children."", 'That Act is a new Magna Charta for those who work. In its preparation and in its enactment, it was supported not only by organized labor but by those other liberal groups—workers, employers, churches, private charities, educators who for many years have believed that modern Government can make provision against the hardship of unemployment and the terrors of old age.', 'On the passage of this law, in addition to overwhelming support on the part of Democrats in both the House and Senate, the country should note that seventy-seven Republican Representatives voted for it and only eighteen against it, .and that in the Senate fifteen Republican Senators voted for it and only five against it.', 'This fact is perhaps illustrative of the paradox that in the closing days of the campaign, a distraught Republican leadership, driven to desperation and urged on by the same sinister forces which generation after generation have opposed all social legislation, now repudiates its own Representatives and Senators in the halls of the Congress and leaves them looking positively silly.', 'The people of the State of New York recognize in this issue in a national campaign only another form of the struggle to which we have become accustomed in this State for many years past.

We established the Securities Exchange Commission; banking reforms; a sound monetary policy; deposit insurance for fifty million bank accounts—all aimed to safeguard the thrift of our citizens.', 'By our tax policy and by regulating financial markets, we loosened the grip which monopolies had fastened upon independent American business. We began also to free American business and American labor from the unfair competition of a small unscrupulous minority. We established by statute a curb upon the overweening power and unholy practices of some utility holding companies.', ""By the Rural Electrification Act, by the Tennessee Valley Authority and similar projects we set up yardsticks to bring electricity at cheaper rates to the average American farm and the average American home. Through loans to private enterprise and in cooperation with cities, we promoted slum-clearance and established low-cost modern housing. We set up a National Youth Administration to help keep our youth in school and to hold open for them the door of opportunity. By a successful war on crime we have made America's homes and places of business safer against the gangster, the kidnapper and the racketeer."", 'Some people call these things meddling and interference.

There will be none. If we are in trouble we are all of us in trouble together. If we are to be prosperous, if we are to be secure, we must all be prosperous and secure together.', 'Unfortunately, those who now raise the cry of class distinctions are the very leaders whose policies in the past have fostered such distinctions.

It did not work. It was not and cannot be the answer to our problem. We have united all classes in the Nation in a program for the Nation. In doing that, we are bridging the gulf of antagonism which twelve years of neglect had opened up between them.', 'An equally important task remains to be done: to go forward, to consolidate and to strengthen these gains, to close the gaps by destroying the glaring inequalities of opportunity and of security which, in the recent past, have set group against group and region against region.', 'By our policies for the future we will carry forward this program of unity.

Again they will win.', 'More than four years ago in accepting the Democratic nomination in Chicago, I said: ""Give me your help not to win votes alone, but to win in this crusade to restore America to its own people.""', 'The banners of that crusade still fly in the van of a Nation that is on the march.', 'It is needless to repeat the details of the program which this Administration has been hammering out on the anvils of experience. No amount of misrepresentation or statistical contortion can conceal or blur or smear that record. Neither the attacks of unscrupulous enemies nor the exaggerations of over-zealous friends will serve to mislead the American people.', 'What was our hope in 1932? Above all other things the American people wanted peace. They wanted peace of mind instead of gnawing fear.', 'First, they sought escape from the personal terror which had stalked them for three years. They wanted the peace that comes from security in their homes: safety for their savings, permanence in their jobs, a fair profit from their enterprise.', 'Next, they wanted peace in the community, the peace that springs from the ability to meet the needs of community life: schools, playgrounds, parks, sanitation, highways—those things which are expected of solvent local government. They sought escape from disintegration and bankruptcy in local and state affairs.', 'They also sought peace within the Nation: protection of their currency, fairer wages, the ending of long hours of toil, the abolition of child labor, the elimination of wild-cat speculation, the safety of their children from kidnappers.', 'And, finally, they sought peace with other Nations—peace in a world of unrest. The Nation knows that I hate war, and I know that the Nation hates war.', 'I submit to you a record of peace; and on that record a well-founded expectation for future peace—peace for the individual, peace for the community, peace for the Nation, and peace with the world.', 'Tonight I call the roll—the roll of honor of those who stood with us in 1932 and still stand with us today.', 'Written on it are the names of millions who never had a chance—men at starvation wages, women in sweatshops, children at looms.', ""Written on it are the names of those who despaired, young men and young women for whom opportunity had become a will-o'-the-wisp."", 'Written on it are the names of farmers whose acres yielded only bitterness, business men whose books were portents of disaster, home owners who were faced with eviction, frugal citizens whose savings were insecure.', 'Written there in large letters are the names of countless other Americans of all parties and all faiths, Americans who had eyes to see and hearts to understand, whose consciences were burdened because too many of their fellows were burdened, who looked on these things four years ago and said, ""This can be changed. We will change it.""', 'We still lead that army in 1936. They stood with us then because in 1932 they believed. They stand with us today because in 1936 they know. And with them stand millions of new recruits who have come to know.', 'Their hopes have become our record.', 'We have not come this far without a struggle and I assure you we cannot go further without a struggle.', 'For twelve years this Nation was afflicted with hear-nothing, see-nothing, do-nothing Government. The Nation looked to Government but the Government looked away. Nine mocking years with the golden calf and three long years of the scourge! Nine crazy years at the ticker and three long years in the breadlines! Nine mad years of mirage and three long years of despair! Powerful influences strive today to restore that kind of government with its doctrine that that Government is best which is most indifferent.', 'For nearly four years you have had an Administration which instead of twirling its thumbs has rolled up its sleeves. We will keep our sleeves rolled up.', 'We had to struggle with the old enemies of peace—business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering.', 'They had begun to consider the Government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own affairs. We know now that Government by organized money is just as dangerous as Government by organized mob.', 'Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me—and I welcome their hatred.', 'I should like to have it said of my first Administration that in it the forces of selfishness and of lust for power met their match. I should like to have it said of my second Administration that in it these forces met their master.', 'The American people know from a four-year record that today there is only one entrance to the White House—by the front door. Since March 4, 1933, there has been only one pass-key to the White House. I have carried that key in my pocket. It is there tonight. So long as I am President, it will remain in my pocket.', ""Those who used to have pass-keys are not happy. Some of them are desperate. Only desperate men with their backs to the wall would descend so far below the level of decent citizenship as to foster the current pay-envelope campaign against America's working people. Only reckless men, heedless of consequences, would risk the disruption of the hope for a new peace between worker and employer by returning to the tactics of the labor spy."", 'Here is an amazing paradox! The very employers and politicians and publishers who talk most loudly of class antagonism and the destruction of the American system now undermine that system by this attempt to coerce the votes of the wage earners of this country. It is the 1936 version of the old threat to close down the factory or the office if a particular candidate does not win. It is an old strategy of tyrants to delude their victims into fighting their battles for them.', 'Every message in a pay envelope, even if it is the truth, is a command to vote according to the will of the employer. But this propaganda is worse—it is deceit.', 'They tell the worker his wage will be reduced by a contribution to some vague form of old-age insurance. They carefully conceal from him the fact that for every dollar of premium he pays for that insurance, the employer pays another dollar. That omission is deceit.', 'They carefully conceal from him the fact that under the federal law, he receives another insurance policy to help him if he loses his job, and that the premium of that policy is paid 100 percent by the employer and not one cent by the worker. They do not tell him that the insurance policy that is bought for him is far more favorable to him than any policy that any private insurance company could afford to issue. That omission is deceit.', 'They imply to him that he pays all the cost of both forms of insurance. They carefully conceal from him the fact that for every dollar put up by him his employer puts up three dollars three for one. And that omission is deceit.', 'But they are guilty of more than deceit. When they imply that the reserves thus created against both these policies will be stolen by some future Congress, diverted to some wholly foreign purpose, they attack the integrity and honor of American Government itself. Those who suggest that, are already aliens to the spirit of American democracy. Let them emigrate and try their lot under some foreign flag in which they have more confidence.', 'The fraudulent nature of this attempt is well shown by the record of votes on the passage of the Social Security Act. In addition to an overwhelming majority of Democrats in both Houses, seventy-seven Republican Representatives voted for it and only eighteen against it and fifteen Republican Senators voted for it and only five against it. Where does this last-minute drive of the Republican leadership leave these Republican Representatives and Senators who helped enact this law?', 'I am sure the vast majority of law-abiding businessmen who are not parties to this propaganda fully appreciate the extent of the threat to honest business contained in this coercion.', ""I have expressed indignation at this form of campaigning and' I am confident that the overwhelming majority of employers, workers and the general public share that indignation and will show it at the polls on Tuesday next."", 'Aside from this phase of it, I prefer to remember this campaign not as bitter but only as hard-fought. There should be no bitterness or hate where the sole thought is the welfare of the United States of America. No man can occupy the office of President without realizing that he is President of all the people.', 'It is because I have sought to think in terms of the whole Nation that I am confident that today, just as four years ago, the people want more than promises.', 'Our vision for the future contains more than promises.', 'This is our answer to those who, silent about their own plans, ask us to state our objectives.', 'Of course we will continue to seek to improve working conditions for the workers of America—to reduce hours over-long, to increase wages that spell starvation, to end the labor of children, to wipe out sweatshops. Of course we will continue every effort to end monopoly in business, to support collective bargaining, to stop unfair competition, to abolish dishonorable trade practices. For all these we have only just begun to fight.', 'Of course we will continue to work for cheaper electricity in the homes and on the farms of America, for better and cheaper transportation, for low interest rates, for sounder home financing, for better banking, for the regulation of security issues, for reciprocal trade among nations, for the wiping out of slums. For all these we have only just begun to fight.', 'Of course we will continue our efforts in behalf of the farmers of America. With their continued cooperation we will do all in our power to end the piling up of huge surpluses which spelled ruinous prices for their crops. We will persist in successful action for better land use, for reforestation, for the conservation of water all the way from its source to the sea, for drought and flood control, for better marketing facilities for farm commodities, for a definite reduction of farm tenancy, for encouragement of farmer cooperatives, for crop insurance and a stable food supply. For all these we have only just begun to fight.', 'Of course we will provide useful work for the needy unemployed; we prefer useful work to the pauperism of a dole.', 'Here and now I want to make myself clear about those who disparage their fellow citizens on the relief rolls. They say that those on relief are not merely jobless—that they are worthless. Their solution for the relief problem is to end relief—to purge the rolls by starvation. To use the language of the stock broker, our needy unemployed would be cared for when, as, and if some fairy godmother should happen on the scene.', 'You and I will continue to refuse to accept that estimate of our unemployed fellow Americans. Your Government is still on the same side of the street with the Good Samaritan and not with those who pass by on the other side.', 'Again—what of our objectives?', 'Of course we will continue our efforts for young men and women so that they may obtain an education and an opportunity to put it to use. Of course we will continue our help for the crippled, for the blind, for the mothers, our insurance for the unemployed, our security for the aged. Of course we will continue to protect the consumer against unnecessary price spreads, against the costs that are added by monopoly and speculation. We will continue our successful efforts to increase his purchasing power and to keep it constant.', 'For these things, too, and for a multitude of others like them, we have only just begun to fight.', 'All this—all these objectives—spell peace at home. All our actions, all our ideals, spell also peace with other nations.', 'Today there is war and rumor of war. We want none of it. But while we guard our shores against threats of war, we will continue to remove the causes of unrest and antagonism at home which might make our people easier victims to those for whom foreign war is profitable. You know well that those who stand to profit by war are not on our side in this campaign.', '""Peace on earth, good will toward men""—democracy must cling to that message. For it is my deep conviction that democracy cannot live without that true religion which gives a nation a sense of justice and of moral purpose. Above our political forums, above our market places stand the altars of our faith-altars on which burn the fires of devotion that maintain all that is best in us and all that is best in our Nation.', 'We have need of that devotion today. It is that which makes it possible for government to persuade those who are mentally prepared to fight each other to go on instead, to work for and to sacrifice for each other. That is why we need to say with the Prophet: ""What doth the Lord require of thee—but to do justly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God."" That is why the recovery we seek, the recovery we are winning, is more than economic. In it are included justice and love and humility, not for ourselves as individuals alone, but for our Nation.That is the road to peace.']",1
53,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"November 02, 1936","['My friends of Poughkeepsie:', 'I was thinking this afternoon about the first political speech that I made in this city way back in 1910. And it was a terrible speech.', 'I decided not long after 1910 that I would never make another political speech in the city of Poughkeepsie for the very good reason that everybody knows me. And so, in spite of newspaper headlines- and you and I have come to discriminate where they are concerned—in spite of all that, I am not going to make a political speech tonight. I am just going to tell you a few things that are on my chest and in my heart at the end of this campaign.', 'I have visited a great number of States. I have been in the South; I have been in the Middle West; I have been in the Far West; I have been in New England. And I have never seen a political campaign in twenty-five years—twenty-six years—where I could feel inside of me that people all over the country were taking as great and as intelligent an interest in the problems of Government.', 'One of the good things that came out of the depression was the fact that men and women, rich and poor, in every part of the country, have begun to study the future of America. They have been wondering whether we should do this, or that, or the other thing; and back of it all there has lain, as far as I can see, two very definite thoughts in people\'s minds. The first is to retain our American form of Government—the democratic system, spelled with a small ""d""—the representative system of Government. The other thing that I have carried away with me in this campaign is the thought that people want progress, that they feel that there have been a great many things in the past that we did not do, but that with a great deal of modern knowledge and modern experience the time has come in the United States to accomplish more things for the average citizen.', 'People in the past have gone along with the idea that we could do without a great many things such, for instance, as security. Well, security means a kind of feeling within our individual selves that we have lacked all through the course of history. We have had to take our chance about our old age in days past. We have had to take our chances with depressions and boom times. We have had to take chances on our jobs. We have had to take chances on buying our homes.', 'I have believed for a great many years that the time has come in our civilization when a great many of these chances should be eliminated from our lives.', 'It has not been so much a question of party politics. Most of us would have followed any responsible leader who could have shown to the people of this country that he sought to eliminate at least some of those chances in life, some of the hardships that have come to a lot of people through no fault of their own.', 'I know conditions in this city and in this county pretty well. I have lived here for fifty-four years. And all through my life, ever since I have been of age to take any part in public affairs, which is at least a quarter of a century, I have been noticing a great many hardships that have affected the people of the city and the county. As I got older and was able to travel around the country, I found that the same kind of hardships affected people in every other community and county and state.', 'And that is why, as some of you who know me can perhaps realize, I have tried for a good many years to work for the elimination of these hardships.', 'We cannot reach a millennium or utopia in any four years, or eight years; but at least I have felt that people in responsible positions ought to start the ball roiling, that they ought to make an effort, through legislation and through public opinion, in a perfectly normal, sane, sensible way, to provide security—security for people so that they would not individually worry, security for their families, security for their homes, a greater security for their jobs, and, incidentally, a greater security for the people who employ them.', 'That has been an objective of mine for perhaps twenty-five years; and I believe that in these past few years we have taken steps that are going to help the American people toward a greater security within the framework of the American Government.', 'That is perhaps a simple expression of a simple philosophy. I think most of you agree with the philosophy at least. Everybody in public office makes mistakes. Every party in power makes mistakes. But, in the last analysis, the problem before the voters of the country, not only tomorrow but next year and the year after that, is whether they want to vote for those people who they believe will carry out that expression of a greater physical and mental and spiritual security for the people of this country.', ""Tonight at eleven o'clock I am speaking on a nationwide broadcast—and again the newspapers have said it is an appeal for votes. It is not. It is an appeal for people in this Nation to go to the polls—not an appeal to vote any ticket. It is an appeal to exercise their right as American citizens."", 'We have come a long way in 150 years. About a block from where I stand—up there on the corner of Main Street—there was a little old stone building, and in the year 1788 there was held there the Constitutional Convention of the State of New York. My great-great-grandfather was a member of that Convention. The question was: Should New York ratify the Federal Constitution? It was the year before the Federal Government was set up and George Washington was inaugurated our first President. At that time the problem before this Convention in Poughkeepsie was whether the State of New York would ratify the Constitution as it was laid down, without a Bill of Rights.', 'Finally, the delegates from this State, up there in the little old stone building, ratified it only on this condition: ""In full faith and confidence that a Bill of Rights would be added to the Constitution after the country was started under the new form of Government."" And, largely because of the insistence of the State of New York in demanding a Bill of Rights, almost immediately the new Government submitted to the States the first Ten Amendments to the United States Constitution.', 'And in those days at the time of the first election, after the Constitution was ratified and the Government was set up, it is interesting for us to note that very few men—of course there were no women voting in those days—comparatively very few men voted. The reason for that was that in the early days of the United States, the franchise was limited to property holders. Most of this Dutchess County of ours in the early days of the Republic was inhabited by tenant farmers. A tenant farmer could not vote because he was not a freeholder and only freeholders could vote in this and the other counties of the State of New York and the other young States.', 'Today we have a very different proposition. The franchise is universal. You do not have to be the owner of real estate in order to vote.', 'The result is that in the early days of the Nation, with this limited franchise, the results of an election could not be called the rule of the majority, because so few people voted—only property holders. Today you have a different situation and by midnight tomorrow night, in all probability, whatever the result is, it will be definitely, clearly, and conclusively the will of the majority.', 'In the election of 1932, about forty million voters in the United States voted. This year there are about fifty-five million Americans who are eligible to vote tomorrow. I want to express the hope that as many as possible of those fifty-five millions will go to the polls, in order that we may have a clear-cut answer to the problems which will be voted on.', 'I go back a good many years in this city. I can remember when, in the spring, the streets were extremely muddy. I can remember when electric lights first came to Poughkeepsie. And I can remember the first telephone that was put in our house at Hyde Park, much to the horror of most of the family. I can remember that when a telegram came the entire household quaked, because telegrams were seldom sent in those days unless someone died. And, taking it by and large, in those forty or fifty years, I think we have made a good deal of progress not only in other parts of the country, but right here in this city and county; and that is one reason why I am terribly proud of good old Dutchess, whether they vote for me or not.', 'I am not asking any of you to vote for me, but I am expressing this thought: I hope very much that Dutchess County tomorrow will be found on the same side as the majority of the United States.', 'Good night and good luck.']",1
54,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"November 02, 1936","['My friends:', 'I have come home to my own county to vote with my fellow townsmen. My people have voted here in Dutchess County for more than a century. I cast my first vote here in 1903.', 'Tomorrow fifty-five million Americans are eligible to vote. I hope that all of those fifty-five millions will vote.', ""I like to think of these millions as individual citizens from Maine to the southern tip of California, from Key West to Puget Sound—farmers who stop their fall plowing long enough to drive into town with their wives—wage earners stopping on the way to work or the way home—business and professional men and women—town and city housewives—and that great company of youth for whom this year's first vote will be a great adventure."", 'Americans have had to put up with a good many things in the course of our history. But the only rule we have ever put up with is the rule of the majority. That is the only rule we ever will put up with. Spelled with a small ""d"" we are all democrats.', 'In some places in the world the tides are running against democracy. But our faith has not been unsettled. We believe in democracy because of our traditions. But we believe in it even more because of our experience.', 'Here in the United States we have been a long time at the business of self-government. The longer we are at it the more certain we become that we can continue to govern ourselves, that progress is on the side of majority rule, that if mistakes are to be made we prefer to make them ourselves and to do our own correcting.', 'When you and I stand in line tomorrow for our turn at the polls, we shall stand in a line which reaches back across the entire history of our Nation.', 'Washington stood in that line and Jefferson and Jackson and Lincoln. And in later days Cleveland stood there and Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. All these—in their day-waited their turn to vote. And rubbing elbows with them—their voting equals—is a long succession of American citizens whose names are not known to history but who, by their vote, helped to make history.', 'Every man and every woman who has voted in the past has had a hand in the making of the United States of the present. Every man and woman who votes tomorrow will have a hand in the making of the United States of the future. To refuse to vote is to say: ""I am not interested in the United States of the future.""', 'We who live in a free America know that our democracy is not perfect. But we are beginning to know also that, in self-government as in many other things, progress comes from experience. People do not become good citizens by mandate. They become good citizens by the exercise of their citizenship and by the discussions, the reading, the campaign give-and-take which help them make up their minds how to exercise that citizenship.', 'Not only are people voting in larger numbers this year. They also know more this year than ever before about the real issues. They are thinking for themselves. They listen to both sides. They no longer accept at face value opinions or even statements from newspapers, from political spokesmen and from so-called leaders of their communities. They insist on checking up.', 'I doubt if there was ever more downright political intelligence at the average American fireside than there is today.', 'For a century and a half we have had here free education and a free press, free public forums and a free pulpit. For more than a decade we have had a free radio. The American citizen of 1936, therefore, is a product of free institutions. His mind has been sharpened by the exercise of freedom. That is why I have no fear either of the threats of demagogues or the ambitions of dictators. Neither can get far nor long thrive among a people who have learned to think for themselves and who have the courage to act as they think.', 'This year they have thought things through to a point where the eternal simplicities mean more than the fuzz-buzz of technical talk. They know that the important thing is the spirit in which Government will face problems as they come up, and the values it will seek to preserve or to enhance. At bottom those are the things that count.', 'Still another thing heartens me. This year, not only are more people voting, not only have people thought things through more carefully; but more people in all parties have assumed the obligation of citizens to get out and work in the political process by which democracy maintains itself.', 'Nearly six months ago I said: ""I make this specific recommendation-that each and every one who is interested in obtaining the facts and in spreading those facts abroad, each and every one of you interested in getting at the truth that lies somewhere behind the smoke-screen of charges and countercharges of a national campaign, constitute yourself a committee of one.""', 'Hundreds of thousands have responded to that suggestion. Tonight I salute those committees of one, not only with personal gratitude but with the gratitude of a democracy that can only function if its people are willing to take honorable part in it.', 'And I also commend those who have worked in a similar honorable way in the opposition. They, too, have helped the public understand the issues before it, and that is a service to democracy.', 'I confidently look forward to their continued cooperation in the service of democracy. On Saturday night I said that ""there should be no bitterness or hate where the sole thought is the welfare of the United States of America."" That applies to men and women in all parties. It is true, tonight, on the eve of election. It will be true after the election.', 'Whoever is elected tomorrow will become the President of all the people. It will be his concern to meet the problems of all the people with an understanding mind and with no trace of partisan feeling.', 'Any President should welcome any American citizen or group of citizens who can offer constructive suggestions for the management of government or for the improvement of laws.', 'Society needs constant vigilance and the interest of individual men and women.', 'And when you go to the ballot box tomorrow, do not be afraid to vote as you think best for the kind of a world you want to have. There need be no strings on any of us in the polling place.', ""A man or woman in the polling booth is his or her own boss. There once was a time when the ballot was not secret. That is not so today. How a citizen votes is the citizen's own business. No one will fire you because you vote contrary to his wishes or instructions. No one will know how you vote. And do not let any-one intimidate you or coerce you by telling you otherwise."", 'In the polling booth we are all equals.', 'It is an experience in responsibility and humility to be permitted, as President, to know and share the hopes and the difficulties, the patience and the courage, the victories and the defeats of this great people.', 'Sometimes men wonder overmuch what they will receive for what they are giving in the service of a democracy—whether it is worth the cost to share in that struggle which is a part of the business of representative government. But the reward of that effort is to feel that they have been a part of great things, that they have helped to build, that they have had their share in the great battles of their generation.', 'However large or small our part, we can all feel with Theodore Roosevelt who said many years ago: ""It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievement; and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly; so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither defeat nor victory.""']",1
