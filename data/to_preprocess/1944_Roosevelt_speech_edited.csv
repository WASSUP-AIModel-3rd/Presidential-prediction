0,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"November 06, 1944","[""Your neighbor from across the river is mighty glad to be back here after four years. It has become a sort of a four-year custom by now. But it is rather a good custom for me to come to Kingston, and I always like it. I am happy, too, that now my county across the river is going to have a new Congressman. I told them in Newburgh that I was very glad that the legislature had taken my Congressman away from me, and that Hamilton Fish won't be my Congressman after the first of January."", 'You know, I go back into the history of this city quite a long way, because I had an ancestor who came up from New York to a place called Esopus about 1660, which is quite a way back. And he came up here just in time to take a musket and help to repel Indians who tried to kill all the original settlers. He was a member of what they called the militia in those days.', 'And that, perhaps, is why I inherited a good deal of love for the armed forces of the United States, who have been carrying on this war so magnificently.', 'The war is not in Kingston and Hyde Park physically. It is across the oceans. But it means the preservation of our homes in Hyde Park and in Kingston. The people are beginning to realize more and more that we are fighting for the defense of America. I think we are doing a pretty good job of it.', 'It takes me longer to go from Hyde Park to Kingston because you have taken off the ferry. I was complaining to the Mayor about it, and I think probably the only other thing to do is to build a bridge.', 'Well, it has been good to see you on this occasion. I think it is a bigger crowd than it has ever been before. And I hope that in the next four years when I come back for an occasional weekend at home from Washington I will be able to come over here and see you all.', 'In the meantime, I have heard of the great things you are doing in the war. Your Mayor was telling me the wonderful figures, the percentage of your boys that are in the armed forces. And I want to congratulate you also on what you are doing for the Navy in the two yards, one of which I happened to start twenty-five years ago.', 'So, keep up the good work, and good luck to you all.', 'Goodbye.']",1
1,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"November 06, 1944","['Neighbors Of mine, I have been today on another sentimental journey. I have been among my neighbors. I have come down on this side of the river and crossed a big ""sea."" And luckily there were no German submarines in that ""sea""—I went from Beacon to Newburgh.', 'And in my travels this day, I think I have seen a very encouraging sign of our American life- I think the population is increasing enormously. I have seen more children than I knew existed in these three counties. They are coming along in good· shape, and it encourages me greatly to think that the future of the country will be relatively safe in their hands, under a Constitution which has lasted more than 150 years—and I think as long as we increase as we are doing now- we shall still be living under the same old Constitution 155 years from now.', ""Down in Newburgh I went through a shipyard, having a few moments to spare, and then in the upper part of the city there was a crowd that was at least twice or three times the size it was four years ago. And that was encouraging. And I told them there that I did want to say a good word for our legislature because as you know, the duty of apportioning the Congressional Districts of this State is the duty of the legislature. And a curious thing happened recently. Our county used to be in the same District with Putnam and Orange counties. And quite a number of people were irked that the legislature changed it a bit. And then I think a Congressman was taken out of the District, insofar as Dutchess County goes. So, after the first of January we will be in a new Congressional District- we won't be with Orange any more, and therefore we will have a new Congressman."", 'Well, my friends, there is more than one way of getting rid of a Congressman.', ""Then I went up to Kingston, and there again the crowd was at least twice the size it had been before, and I remarked to them-you can see I am pure Hudson River when you come down to it—that my mother's family came from Newburgh- but up in Kingston—well, there was an old boy in 1660 who went up there from New York City. He was young, and I guess he was rather Dutch- with the old stubborn qualities. About that time the Indians attacked Kingston, and he became a member of the militia that rolled the Indians back."", 'And I think that it is for that reason, perhaps, that I am interested and have been all my life—though not in uniform—in military and naval affairs. It comes from the old Dutch boy in 1660 who belonged to the militia.', 'But one sad thing happened. I had to come all the way back down the west side of the river. They had taken off the Kingston ferry! Otherwise, the District and the county had changed very little in the last four years.', ""We were headed at that time- four years ago- into a war. We didn't talk about it very much. It doesn't do to scare people or alarm people. But we did a good deal of building and preparation, and by 1941 we had over two million men in the Army and Navy. We built up our munitions factories. We sent a great deal of aid to the people who were fighting Nazism and Fascism. And the result was that we were better prepared for this war than we had been in all our history for any war. We haven't been bombed in this country—rap on wood—and we haven't lost anything within our own boundaries during this war."", 'And now we are carrying on the offensive against the enemy, in order to make it quite certain that our own homes back here shall be safe.', ""I don't know—I think we have done a fair job of it, but anyway we have done it in the American way, with the approval of the American people, and that is something—to go on with our same ideals, our same form of government- as we have always done."", 'And I hope tomorrow that it is going to be said in this country that the war has been conducted constitutionally, and with the approval of the people of the United States. I hope that will be said. I think it will.', 'And so it has been good—it has been a good day. I have seen my near neighbors. I have seen the neighbors across the river and down the county—the southern end. I have seen an awful lot of people. It has been a good day, and I want to thank you for coming out tonight at this late hour, because it has given me a chance to see some of my nearer neighbors.', 'It is good to see you, and I am going to come back pretty often.']",1
