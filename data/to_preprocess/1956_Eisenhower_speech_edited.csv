0,Dwight D. Eisenhower ,"September 23, 1954","['May I first address the heads of the organizations that are my hosts this evening: Mrs. Kearns, Madam President of the National Federation of Republican Women, Mr. Saunders, Chairman of the Citizens for Eisenhower of Southern California, and Mr. Trippitt, President of the Democrats for Eisenhower--and my fellow Americans:', 'Incidentally, this is the first time I have had the great privilege of using such words in addressing my hosts.', 'Now for many reasons I am delighted to be with you. Here I meet again with groups which 2 years ago did so much to reverse the trend toward highly centralized government in our Nation.', 'Among you are the representatives of the women of the Republican Party, inspired with that wonderful determination for good that has always characterized your activities. Others of you represent other groups bound not by party ties but by a common devotion to good government-government administered by public servants of integrity and purpose.', 'Naturally, I want, first, to pay my compliments to all of you who have joined together to be my hosts tonight, but far more than this, I feel that I owe to you an accounting of the progress made by the administration that your efforts did so much, 2 years ago, to send to Washington.', 'I think, too, that it is time that we had a talk about the course of our Government for the next 2 years.', 'We are meeting in a great State which has furnished the Nation so many distinguished public servants. It is the State which only recently has given our country a man who will be known in history as one of the great Chief Justices of the United States, Earl Warren. It is the home State of another devoted public servant who both here and abroad has been doing such a great job for all of us--our Vice President, Dick Nixon. Here, too, is the home of a man who in the last Congress demonstrated outstanding qualities of ability and leadership--the Majority Leader of the United States Senate, Bill Knowland. And, my friends, I think I speak for everyone present when I say that the prayers of this entire gathering are with Mrs. Knowland, for her early return to health. And, tonight, I am especially happy to be in the company of an able compatriot in the business of government, Tom Kuchel, who as a member of the Senate has ably served his State and our Nation.', 'My respects go as well to the Congressmen of our party who have worked so diligently to bring success to our cause. And of course, I cannot forget your Governor, who so graciously introduced me to this audience.', 'Now, all of these men, and all of you here tonight have shown that you are Americans willing to do more than just talk about having a better and stronger Nation--an America willing to work and to fight for the kind of country that you are determined to have. You are among the millions of our citizens who take seriously their obligations of citizenship. You are not content merely to be bystanders in the business of self-government. And because you are leaders--dedicated leaders-you persuade others to exercise their civic responsibilities as well.', 'Through such selfless devotion, all of America is strengthened, and our freedoms are made more secure.', 'Our common interest is good government. All good government is produced only by able and dedicated people. Government is people. All of you in this great audience are, therefore, a part of the stuff of which good government is made. Our common purpose is that our Government shall daily advance the good of all of our people, regardless of race or color or creed or political affiliation or regional considerations.', 'In this effort in the past, you have made speeches. You have buttonholed your neighbors. You have pounded the pavements. You have used the telephone. You have addressed envelopes. And you have licked stamps.', 'And you well know what resulted 2 years ago from all those efforts.', 'I know that you will again succeed. Because, as good citizens, you know that in the American way, it is not enough to start a job with zeal and enthusiasm. You must also have the stamina and the determination to see it through.', 'Let us, then, militantly resolve here tonight to carry forward together the great work we undertook 2 years ago.', ""Now, what did we start out to do? How far have we come? What's left to be done? These are the political questions of our day that are truly important."", 'Two years ago the people of our country voted to have clean government. What has happened in the 20 months since?', 'Not one appointee of this administration has been involved in scandal or corruption.', 'Moreover, in this administration, not politics, nor complacency, nor cronyism, will stay the use of every available legal and investigative process to prevent abuse of the public trust. Integrity and decency and dignity have been restored to the Federal Government. Our Government again stands high in the eyes of our people. This is clean government.', 'Two years ago the people of our country demanded a cut in the high cost of their Government. They wanted a cut, too, in their high taxes.', 'And what has been done?', 'This administration and your Congress, under Republican leadership, have cut the cost of your Government by over eleven billion dollars. This has made it possible for us to pass on to the taxpayer 7 billion 400 million dollars of this saving. This is equal to an annual saving of almost fifty dollars for every man, woman, and child in all America. This is the biggest tax cut in the history of the United States. Now the remainder of this savings in governmental costs is being applied against the previously planned budget deficits, so that our debt--the public debt--will not unnecessarily keep piling up.', 'This administration believes that the individual knows better how to spend his money than does a bureaucrat in Washington.', 'And may I emphasize that the tax laws have been executed without political favoritism and without corruption.', ""Two years ago our people were longing for a prosperous economy-without war. The useless shooting that could lead nowhere except to ever growing casualty lists has been stopped. The tremendous expenditures to support it have been stopped. Nevertheless, the Nation's economy has adjusted to these new conditions with minimum economic detriment to most of our people. This is true even in those areas most directly affected by war production. The year 1954 is, in fact, the best peacetime year in our history."", 'But we are most certainly not satisfied--far from it. I am keenly aware of the economic dislocation and individual hardships which, in certain locations, are the aftermath of war and inflation. The administration and the Republican Congress have moved and will continue to move with the full force of the Federal Government to ease these problems.', 'And we have provided many strong protections to strengthen our economy. Among these are tax revisions which encourage new enterprise--and make new jobs. We have new housing programs. And there are no windfall profits in them. The FHA has been overhauled and revitalized and has again become an indispensable and an effective agency in helping to provide homes for those who need them. We have soundly expanded the social security system to include ten million more Americans. We have a broadened unemployment compensation program--for four million more Americans. We have provided advantageous group life insurance for every Government worker.', 'This evening I met briefly the wife of our Postmaster General, who told me that after this insurance program was effected and accomplished, within 3 days thereafter a man working for the Post Office Department died, and except for this insurance system his wife and family would have been left penniless. Now they have something on which to live.', 'We have an expanded road program made possible by returning to the States money received from Federal gasoline taxes. We have enacted a farm program that will prevent the accumulation of unmanageable surpluses. This program will lead to full parity in the market place for the farmer, instead of a percentage of parity at some Government warehouse. All of these measures--and there are many more--provide an even stronger economy, an economy that will stay strong, that will continue to grow, an economy under which Americans will continue to prosper.', ""At last our Nation's economic strength is of an enduring kind."", 'It is not a prosperity based on the froth of inflation.', 'We flatly reject the idea that, for America to stay prosperous, we must constantly run an economic fever.', 'We flatly reject the idea that, for America to stay prosperous, the Government must always spend more than it has.', 'No longer do we have a prosperity pegged to the battlefield sacrifices of our husbands, our sons, and our brothers.', 'We do have a prosperous economy--and we have it without war. We have kept faith with the American people.', 'And over the world we are building strength where there was weakness. We have brought realism where there was wishful thinking in our foreign dealings. We have brought frankness, candor, and force to a foreign policy which at last insists on distinguishing words from deeds in the conduct of the affairs of the world.', 'Much of a specific and concrete character has been accomplished in this field.', 'Two years ago, it looked almost certain that our friends in Iran would bow to communist imperialism. With their downfall the free world would have lost over 60 percent of the known petroleum reserves of the world. The consequences would have been disastrous.', 'Iran today has new strength, new hope, new determination. Iran has a new tie to the cause of freedom. Disaster has been averted.', 'At Suez, ancient irritations and quarrels involving two of our friends have been resolved. Peace has been preserved. Progress has been assured in an area vital to Western civilization.', 'Pakistan has become a valued new ally.', 'In the Far East, despite the inescapable misfortune of Indochina, the United States Navy has just completed the resettlement of 250,000 evacuees from the Communist-held northern sections, and have transferred them to places where they could five in conditions of freedom. A new concert of nations is building strength in this region, where there was weakness. In that crucial area of the world there has been established for the first time, a solid, enduring relationship between the Western World and the friendly people of Asia.', 'At Caracas the American Republics joined in a solid working arrangement assuring the defeat of any future attempts to impose communistic imperialism upon the peoples of the Americas.', 'As a result, in Guatemala, the first beachhead of international communism in the Western Hemisphere has been eliminated.', 'In spite of recent disappointments in Europe, the growing strength of NATO continues to bring an increased sense of security to the free people of that vital area. We are, with continuing determination and confidence, working with our friends to bring about a new defensive arrangement which will further assure the freedom of the peoples of western Europe.', 'Throughout the world a series of alliances and improved understandings among our friends has enhanced the strength of the free world, upon which our own security so very greatly depends. These are merely examples of results brought largely about by the tireless efforts of our distinguished Secretary of State, Foster Dulles.', 'I am gratified to report to this great audience that this administration has maintained a continuing bipartisan discussion of the foreign problems of this Nation--a record of bipartisan consultation unmatched in any previous administration. To you and to all Americans, patriots above all sectional and partisan considerations, I know this accomplishment is of real meaning.', 'Now at home, what of our national defense?', 'First and foremost, we have established a business administration in the gigantic defense organization. We are eliminating the waste of duplication and inefficiency.', 'No longer do we have a feast and famine program of defense. Skyrocketing expansion of our Armed Forces, inspired by hysterical fear, followed by their reckless contraction resulting from complacency, are the most perilous and costly kind of military program. We have adopted a stable, long-term policy, emphasizing a steady buildup of our military strength with efficiency and with economy.', 'No longer do we waste vast sums for mothballing and demothballing of ships--on opening and closing of military bases. No longer do we force in and force out of the Armed Forces young veterans who already have served this Nation in time of war.', 'No longer do we build combat air wings just on paper.', 'Instead, today, at a cost of billions less, we have an armed strength far more efficient and better organized than ever before--a defense stronger and readier in peacetime than it has ever been.', ""Next--today we at last deal effectively with the Communist conspiracy in the United States itself. This doesn't mean that every citizen should suspect his neighbor or fear the loss of his constitutional rights. But it does mean that we are backing up the FBI and the Department of Justice in dealing forthrightly with any who would plot the violent destruction of our form of Government. The Congress and the executive branch have taken the statutory and administrative steps necessary to treat this problem with the care and the vigor it requires. This administration does not look upon the Communist menace as a red herring."", 'Yes, we promised to strive for a prosperous America, at peace. We promised an efficient defense against attack from abroad and against subversion at home. We promised a realistic foreign policy.', 'As to performance, over and above what I have said, we invite the most rigid scrutiny of the record.', 'But we said we would do even more than this.', ""We said we would cut down padded Federal payrolls--that we'd clean out misfits and unfits in the Government service. And in 20 months padded payrolls have been cut by over 211,000. Security risks have been removed from sensitive positions."", 'We said we would reverse the deadly trend toward centralization of Government power in Washington. This we have done. In addition, pursuant to an act of Congress, I have appointed a Commission, composed of distinguished Americans, which for months has been examining closely all phases of Federal, State, and local responsibility, and their relationships one to another.', ""We said we'd remove stifling controls from the Nation's economy. This was done a year and a half ago, amid dire predictions of carping critics that inflation would follow and prices would soar out of sight. Despite these gloomy predictions, inflation was stopped and the cost of living was stabilized."", 'As all of this was being done, we were also stopping bureaucrats in Washington from doing a lot of things that you and all enterprising Americans can do better yourselves.', 'We have tried to live by the maxim of Abraham Lincoln: ""The legitimate object of Government,"" he said, ""is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done, but cannot do at all, or cannot so well do for themselves--in their separate and individual capacities."" And he added, ""In all that the people can individually do for themselves, Government ought not to interfere.""', 'In keeping with this sound and sage advice, the Government is stopping the manufacture of ice and of cement. It is being stopped from retreading tires, repairing shoes, roasting coffee, making clothes. The Government has been stopped from making rope, operating rubber plants, running a commercial bank.', 'The Government has been stopped from operating a big fleet of tugs and barges on our inland waterways. All of these things are again in the hands of private citizens--exactly where they belong.', 'We made another commitment to the American people 2 years ago. We promised a new era of cooperation between the Executive and the Congress--cooperation that would lead to progressive accomplishment for the good of all our people--as visualized by our Founding Fathers when they wrote the Constitution for the United States of America.', 'For the past 20 months there has been harmony unprecedented in our time between the Executive and the Congress--harmony that has led to progressive accomplishments for the good of all our people. This must be preserved.', 'Now, on the promises to which I have adverted, we have delivered. Our people know it.', 'But the program is not completed. There is much to be done. We must keep on working.', 'We shall keep on, despite those misguided and irresponsible people who, hoping for individual advantage, spread fear--fear of war, fear of atomic disaster, fear of international catastrophe, fear of depression-false fears, my friends, of tomorrow and of ourselves. Fellow Americans, 2 years ago the people of this country proved that they will not listen to the peddlers of fear.', 'We shall ride forward over their gloom-filled talk and their cynical doubts.', 'Our program is for just one thing: the practical good of 160 million Americans. In 2 years we have done much toward that goal. But we have much more to do.', 'Important legislation must be considered by the next Congress. This would include a great program to expand our foreign trade, a program to promote American investment abroad, a comprehensive water resources program. It will include a tremendous new highway program. It will include legislation to meet the needs of our people in the field of health and medical care--and it will once and for all repudiate the philosophy of socialized medicine. It will include consideration of the very important recommendations that will grow out of the White House Conference on Education. The next Congress will consider legislation of fundamental importance respecting the personnel of our Armed Forces. A new Armed Forces Reserve System will be established. Congress will be called upon to consider the exceedingly important recommendations of the Hoover Commission and also those of the Commission on Intergovernmental Relations and Fiscal Affairs concerning the relations between Federal, State, and local governments.', 'Many other important problems will command the attention of the next Congress. Among them will be measures for lowering the voting age in Federal elections, statehood for Hawaii, amendments to our labor-management laws, and other as yet unrealized promises in the national platform of the Republican Party. We are determined to fulfill every commitment that we have made to the American people.', 'Will we be able to go ahead to attain these goals for a better America?', 'Let us look at a few political facts. Under our system, many millions of our citizens have partisan affiliations. This is as it should be. In no other way can party responsibility be fixed under our system.', 'But for a political party in our Nation to be held clearly accountable to the people for its political philosophy and programs to guide the course of our Government, it is essential that that party control both the executive and the legislative branches of the Government. This is what all of you worked for in 1952.', 'When, unfortunately, the Congress is controlled by one political party and the executive branch by the other, politics in Washington has a field day. The conduct of Government tends, under these conditions, to deteriorate into an endless round of contests for political advantage-an endless round of political maneuverings, of stagnation and inaction-of half measures or no measures at all. These are the reasons--the compelling reasons--why the completion of your great program requires the election of a Republican-led Congress.', 'My friends, 2 years ago I called upon those who believe in the principles and objectives that we commonly share, to fight for their advancement with all their heart and force. Tonight I renew that call. I call upon you for a rekindling of the enthusiasm and determination of 1952. I am convinced that the great majority of Americans believe that we are on the right course. But the very confidence that they now have in our Government has understandably diminished their constant and active participation in its affairs. They think everything is all right. They must make sure that it remains so. It is our task, therefore, to reactivate their participation. It is our task again to organize the hearts and minds and the efforts of this great majority actively in this cause. You are leaders in this task. And as leaders, you must seek the cooperation and fighting support of our people, regardless of party, who, like you, want to support these principles and these objectives.', 'Let me make this clear: this is the time to go to work. This is the time for rededication, for renewed effort.', 'We must carry forward our program--a program which in deeds and in facts gives voice to the spirit of America. It is a program whose success will inspire gratitude in the hearts of all of our people, now and in the future.', 'And now, my friends, before I leave this platform, may I thank you once again for the cordiality of your welcome. I should like also to take this moment to thank all those who, along the streets of this great city today, gave me a smile and a welcome and a ""Hi Ike.""', 'Good night, and God bless you.']",1
1,Dwight D. Eisenhower ,"October 08, 1954","['[Broadcast from the City Auditorium at 7:35 p.m.]', 'Governor Thornton, Mr. Vice President, distinguished leaders of the Congress, members of this great audience, and my good friends, over all of America:', 'Tonight, as I speak to my countrymen, I am privileged to address myself especially to my fallow Republican workers, gathered here in Denver and in meetings throughout our land. To each of you--to your families, to your friends, and to your political associates--I send my warmest greetings.', 'All of us are happy that tonight Mr. Nixon, Speaker Joe Martin, and the other members of our able legislative team are here with us. Under the leadership of these men, the 83d Congress made its record of extraordinary success. They have my respect and admiration for the splendid service they have rendered to the American people.', 'Tonight, in our meetings over America, we come together as members of the Republican Party. But in spirit we have also. with us the vast army of other Americans who in 1952, and since, have fought alongside us for the great plans and programs for which together we stand.', ""We assemble here, and all over America, proud of our Party's principles-proud of our Party's record."", 'Now, what are these principles and that record, and as Republicans, what is our goal?', ""That goal is not political power for its own sake, but to advance the good of 163 million Americans. To that end, we are dedicated to the maximum of individual freedom, fostered by a government desiring not to dominate but only to serve--a government kept close to the hearthsides of America--a government liberal in dealing with the human concerns of the people, but conservative in spending their money. From Lincoln's day to this, these have been the fundamental aims of our historic Party."", 'Republicans believe that such government will best preserve liberty and justice, and prosperity and happiness in our land.', 'Such a government will best promote an enduring peace throughout the world.', 'These are the convictions that unite us; this is the cause that inspires us--and our friends--to continued and dedicated effort.', 'Two years ago the people of our country showed their desire for this kind of government.', 'Remember election day 1952. In the early hours of morning, in thousands of precincts over America, our citizens eagerly lined up to vote long before the polls were open.', 'Do you remember why Americans crowded to the polls on November 4th, 1952?', ""Let's think back."", 'Two years ago Americans wanted an end to the war in Korea. It was a costly war, allowed to become futile, and seemingly without end.', 'They wanted something done about our veterans, who suddenly found the country so poorly prepared that they themselves had once again to undergo the dangers of battle, while others remained at home who had never served.', ""Americans wanted a government thrifty and frugal with the public's money."", 'They wanted a stop to the endless rise in taxes, taking more and more of the family income to support an overgrown Washington bureaucracy.', 'They wanted something done about inflation--to end the growing discouragement as day by day pensions and savings and the weekly pay check bought less and less at the corner store.', 'Americans were determined to eliminate penetration by the communist conspiracy in our government and in our whole society. They did not consider this menace a red herring.', 'They wanted clean, honest government.', 'They were anxious to get rid of the antagonism between the Congress and the Executive which hamstrung the processes of government.', 'All this America wanted two years ago, and you--you, and those like you throughout this great nation--did something about it.', 'You remember the telephone brigades of two years ago. You remember the ""Get Out The Vote"" campaigns. You remember the drive, the enthusiasm that in November 1952, surged forth from our people.', 'And what happened? You got results.', 'The people of America established in Washington the kind of government they wanted.', 'In just 20 months, we have come far.', ""First of all, with the help of thousands of citizens from every walk of life and from every, part of America, we devised a comprehensive, progressive program in keeping with the Republican Party's Platform and the pledges made to America during the campaign. Fundamentally, that program has but one purpose--to make America stronger and better, with growing prosperity and happiness for all of our people."", 'Now that program was made up of many parts affecting every phase of the life of our great nation. Some parts could be accomplished quickly. Others necessarily had to be developed slowly over the months, to assure their fitness and effectiveness. Important sections still remain to be enacted. The program is one, therefore, of continuous and simultaneous study and action. Its completion is essential to the future prosperity, security and peace of the people of America.', ""So, let's consider this program and what has happened since its inception."", ""Fourteen months ago, the futile sacrifices in Korea were stopped. We now have clean, honest, decent government in Washington. Government spending has been sharply reduced. Stifling controls have been removed from our nation's economy, amid dire predictions of carping critics that inflation would follow and prices would soar out of sight."", ""In 20 months, this Administration and the Republican-led Congress cut our government's costs by 11 billion dollars."", 'And at last, we have a tax cut!', 'Taxes were cut by 7 billion 400 million dollars--the largest tax cut in the history of this nation. It brings benefits to every family in every American home.', 'At the same time, we smoked out 211 thousand unnecessary positions on the Federal payrolls.', 'All during this time, our government has been returning to private citizens activities traditionally belonging to private citizens.', 'It is stopping the roasting of coffee, the baking of bread, the making of paint and clothes. It has stopped running a hotel. It has stopped running a tug and barge business on our inland waterways. In keeping with the philosophy of our whole program, all of these activities have been returned to private citizens--exactly where they belong.', 'My friends, I could never mention this subject without adverting to a statement of our first and greatest leader, Lincoln. He said, ""The legitimate business of government is to do for a people or a community those things which they cannot do at all for themselves, or cannot so well do in their separate capacities; but in all those things that people can do for themselves, the government ought not to interfere.""', 'I think no better philosophy for a free government has ever yet been stated.', 'Now, Americans wanted a strong national defense at less cost.', 'We have today the strongest armed forces of our peacetime history. In building them we have saved vast funds. We have cut red tape and eliminated duplication and waste. And let me make this clear: our military strength does not consist of forcibly recalled veterans who have already served our nation in war.', ""But, of course, our people also wanted a strong peacetime economy. For this, the Congress took many steps. It passed, for example, a new housing program. It passed an expanded highway program. It passed a new farm program to stop the seven-year decline in farmers' income-a program to promote lasting farm prosperity in an America no longer at war. And that program was designed also to remove the great surpluses that were breaking the back of the program then existing."", ""The Congress extended old age and survivor's insurance to 10 million, 200 thousand more Americans, and raised their benefits. And at last, my friends, these benefits include farmers who have been indirectly helping to pay the cost of the social security system all these years. The Congress extended coverage of unemployment compensation to 4 million more Americans. It passed tax revisions to encourage small business, and to eliminate inequities in the law."", ""Due to these and other measures, we have at last an economy whose strength is not sapped by the virus of inflation. It is an economy that doesn't compel the piling up of debts for our children--an economy whose strength is not dependent upon the sacrifices of the battlefield."", 'Without the economic collapse so widely forecast by professional pessimists, our nation has moved from war to peace.', 'Nevertheless, I am keenly aware that in some American localities, dislocations and hardships do exist. These are the inescapable aftermath of war and inflation. These problems we are striving constantly to ease. In the localities concerned, as well as in the rest of the country, we are taking concrete action to foster strength in the whole economy.', 'There was something else, two years ago, that all of us especially wanted. We wanted subversives out of the government service.', 'This Administration and the Congress are dealing decisively with the communist menace. Supported by eleven new laws, we are backing to the hilt the Department of Justice and the FBI. There is no vacillation nor inaction on the part of this Administration in dealing with those who, by force or violence, would overthrow the government of the United States.', 'And abroad, we have an honest, forthright foreign policy concerned with deeds, not merely words. Over the globe our friends know our devotion to freedom. They know that America joins with those who help themselves in the effort to preserve liberty and peace.', ""Two years ago, war was raging in Korea and Indochina. All Asia lay exposed to the steady advance of the Reds. Iran, with 60 percent of the world's known petroleum reserves, was in deadly danger. Suez and Trieste posed constant threats to peace in the West. Europe had foundered on century-old differences, unable to build a position of reliable strength. Even in the Western Hemisphere, communist imperialism had ominously appeared."", 'You know of the events that have since occurred.', 'In London, a few days ago, an agreement of momentous significance was signed that can powerfully strengthen the defenses of the West. Just this week, after almost a decade of anxious effort, Yugoslavia and Italy, with the encouragement and help of the Western world, settled their differences over Trieste.', 'For the first time in twenty years, there is no active battlefield anywhere in the world.', 'And, at last, we are harnessing the atom to the work of peace.', 'As for nations which, despite our best efforts, are still unfriendly, they harbor no delusions about the determination and the growing strength of the free world.', 'Recently, communist imperialism discovered that the entire Association of American Republics means business in defending freedom. First at Caracas, then in ten short, determined days, the communist beachhead in Guatemala was eliminated.', 'In all these ways, then, there has been progress of the most tremendous import to the peace and security of the Western world. Much of this progress is due to the richness of experience, imagination and determination of our distinguished Secretary of State. He and his colleagues in the State Department and the Foreign Service are carrying American prestige to new heights in foreign chancelleries.', 'Fellow Citizens, I have recited some of the advances made in many fields in a short 20 months. For the most part, they have grown out of a cordial partnership between the Administration and the Congress. This cordiality has been a welcome relief from the bickering and the suspicion that for so long poisoned relations between the Executive and Legislative Branches. In laws passed, and in heightened respect for their government, this harmony has brought immense benefits to the American people.', ""And now, let's take a quick look at the future."", 'Many things need to be done.', 'We must continue to foster the growth of a free economy to provide more jobs and higher living standards.', 'We must continue our efforts to cut the cost of government, so we can cut taxes still more.', 'We must continue each year to improve our peacetime farm program.', 'We must have a vast new highway program.', 'We must expand our foreign trade and American investment abroad.', ""We must expand markets for America's farms and factories, if we are to keep prosperity within our own land."", 'We must write into law a national water resources program.', 'We must help our people meet their critical health and medical needs, while repudiating socialization of medicine.', 'We must find ways to encourage communities to provide the school-houses they need, and to improve opportunities for their school teachers.', 'We must build a new and effective reserve program for our armed forces.', 'We must begin to unravel the confused relations between the Federal, State and local governments, and make still more improvements in the organization of the Federal government.', 'We must drive through partisan obstructions to achieve statehood for Hawaii, to lower the voting age in Federal elections, and to make our promised changes in the labor-management laws.', 'We must continue our historic advances in the vital area of civil rights.', 'We must vigorously push all constructive measures for promoting world peace, always strong and secure, but always fair and conciliatory.', ""Now, my friends, a cold war of partisan politics between the Congress and the Executive Branch won't give us these goals."", 'And this brings up a political fact of life.', ""You know perfectly well that you just can't have one car with two drivers at the steering wheel and expect to end up anyplace but in the ditch--especially when the drivers are set on going in different directions. By the same token, you cannot have efficient Federal government when the Congress wants to follow one philosophy of government and the Executive Branch another."", 'In our system of government, progress is made when the leaders of the Executive Branch and the majority of the Congress are members of the same political party. The unsurpassed record of the 83d Congress is shining evidence of this truth. Moreover, in no other way can Americans hold one party and one group of people responsible either for success or lack of success.', ""History shows that when the Executive and Legislative Branches are politically in conflict, politics in Washington runs riot. In these conditions,. the public good goes begging while politics is played for politics' sake. Meanwhile, in the eyes of the world, we appear divided in council and uncertain in purpose."", 'These are the reasons--the compelling reasons--why the completion of your great program requires the election of a Republican-led Congress.', 'In our effort to keep the kind of government we want, you citizens are on the political front lines--the precincts of America. There you are as much a part of government as the sincere, hard-working men and women in Washington today who are trying to give you the kind of government you want.', 'As leaders and workers in your precincts, you know that the members of our Party cannot carry this battle alone. We must enlist the spirited support of friends and neighbors, regardless of party, who believe in the same principles and objectives. Happily, we have been blessed with millions of such sturdy allies. For the cause in which we believe is bigger than any political party. To this cause, all Americans, regardless of party, can give their enthusiastic support.', 'And in this struggle, I know you will have the same determination-the same enthusiasm--the same drive--as you had two years ago.', 'For only through your effort can our program continue to advance.', 'Only through your effort will we continue to have the kind of America all of us so earnestly desire.', 'Together, my friends, we shall forge ahead in this great work we have so well begun, determined to keep America strong and secure--determined that this land of freedom, under Almighty God, will not rest until we see in the world a lasting peace with justice. Together we shall forge ahead to build in our America a steadily growing prosperity and happiness that will bring an ever brighter future for our people and for those who, after we are gone, must carry forward the banner of freedom.', 'That, my fellow Americans, is our kind of America.', 'Working together with those millions who have made common cause with us in this effort, that is the kind of America we shall have.', 'Thank you--thank you--and goodnight to all of you.']",1
2,Dwight D. Eisenhower ,"October 15, 1954","['Dean Reed, and my fellow Americans:', 'I hope you will permit me, first, a personal message from my wife who, because of slight indisposition, couldn\'t come this evening and stayed on her plane. She heard that this magnificent chorus was going to sing ""Mamie,"" and she asked me particularly to thank the chorus on her behalf.', 'I feel a deep sense of distinction in meeting so many of you tonight, both you in this great hall and those I am privileged to greet by radio and by television in their own homes across this land.', 'May I, first, on behalf of all of us, pay my respects to the distinguished leaders of American agriculture here with us this evening. Likewise, I salute the leaders in research, science, and industry who are taking part in this meeting through the National Institute of Animal Agriculture.', 'And, my friends, will you permit me to pay a personal tribute to a former county agricultural agent who is with us tonight. I refer to the most devoted, most dedicated friend of American agriculture I know: our Secretary of Agriculture, Ezra Taft Benson.', ""Now, my principal purpose this evening is to give you an account of this administration's stewardship in matters specially affecting our agricultural community. In doing so I do not mean to imply that our farmers' interests are limited to farming. Far from it! Nor is a prosperous agriculture of interest to the farmer alone. The welfare of 163 million Americans is bound up with our Nation's agriculture--just as every farmer is affected by all national and world affairs."", 'First, our farmers, like the rest of us, want and need peace. They want their boys at home, and not at war. So, it is important to all of us that the seemingly endless and frustrating war in Korea was ended 14 months ago. Today we have peace. For the first time in 20 years, there is no active battlefield anywhere in the world. And I pledge to you that every resource of this country is being tirelessly used to make it a lasting peace. Our Nation extends the hand of friendship to all in the world who will grasp it in honesty and good faith. We will confer on this subject with any and all--if only we can have some assurance of sincerity of purpose, which must underlie all progress toward permanent peace. In this I know I speak for every American citizen, regardless of partisan or any other consideration.', 'Our farmers, just as all of us, want America strongly defended. Now, under methods that assure the least possible cost to the taxpayer, our military strength grows daily. And we have today the strongest Armed Forces in our peacetime history, and by far the most efficient.', 'Our farmers, like all the rest of us, want relief from oppressive taxation. In 21 months we have cut the cost of Government by 11 billion dollars. This tremendous saving made possible a tax cut of 7 billion, 400 million dollars. It is the largest tax cut in history--an equivalent of about $180 for every family in America.', 'Our farmers, like all the rest of us, demand efficient Government. In 1 1/2 years 211 thousand excess positions have been dropped from the Federal payroll.', 'Our farmers, as all of us, want a trustworthy government--a government that deals quickly and effectively with those in its employ who are unfit, or corrupt, or tinged with communism. Misfits are being tirelessly searched out and removed from sensitive government positions. New laws passed by the 83d Congress have powerfully strengthened the efforts of the Department of Justice and the FBI to deal with the Communist menace in our country.', 'Our farmers, and all of us, want a national economy strong in all its parts, not dependent on the froth of inflation or the blood of the battlefield. We have moved from war to peace without the economic collapse so widely predicted last winter by professionally pessimistic but politically hopeful prophets. For our Nation as a whole, this year 1954 is the most prosperous peacetime year in our entire history.', 'Even so, as the inevitable aftermath of war and inflation, economic dislocations and individual hardships exist in some industrial communities and in some farming areas. My heart truly goes out to every citizen who wants to work and has no job, or who, in other ways, suffers these hardships. Methods to eliminate distress and to build enduring economic strength in these localities are being thoroughly explored and pursued.', 'So, peace, lower taxes, honest government, a strong economy, personal security--these we must seek for every American. We must never forget that the fortunes of all of us are tightly intertwined. This interdependency applies also among the nations of the world--certainly among the nations which are free.', 'This was not so widely understood when I was a boy working on the farms of Kansas. Then, a half-century ago, we were, except for the weekly newspaper, somewhat isolated from the rest of the world- In those days we plowed with a team of horses and a one-bottom plow. We stacked our hay by hand. When a calm stopped the windmill we had to pump countless buckets of water for use in home and stable. The nearest thing to a tractor we saw were the big engines used for running threshing machines.', 'And then came automobiles, mechanization, electricity, telephone, radio, and television, and life today on our farms is a far different thing.', ""And yet, in many ways, it hasn't changed. Markets and weather are still unpredictable. Wind and hail, mud and dust, floods and drought still exist. There are still the insects and plant and animal disease. Watering and feeding the stock, and milking the cows, still have to be done right on time. In short, good farming is still sun-up to sun-down work."", 'But just look at what this hard work has done for America', 'A skilled American farm worker today produces food and clothing for eighteen other Americans. What a contrast with countries where as many as nine must toil to provide food for themselves and one other person.', 'And yet, in large sections of agriculture, this work has not received its fair reward. Two years ago, the farmers of America were fearful--they were fearful for reasons that went beyond their suspicions of corruption and subversion in government and the Korean war. They saw definite signs of impending disaster in farm programs and in our agricultural economy.', 'They wanted a stop to falling income, a stop to rising farm costs, a stop to the loss of markets, a stop to the piling up of threatening and unmanageable surpluses.', 'In the 2 years before this administration took office in January 1953, the parity ratio dropped nineteen points. Our farmers suffered a serious loss in buying power. Here are the facts.', 'In 1947, a cotton farmer could buy a pickup truck with 9 bales. By the end of 1952, it took not 9 but 14 bales.', 'In 1947, 800 bushels of corn would buy a tractor. By the end of 1952, it took not 800 but over 1,300 bushels--two-thirds more.', 'In 1947, 930 bushels of wheat would buy a combine. By the end of 1952, it took not 930 but over 1,600 bushels--three-fourths more.', ""My friends, this steady decline in farmers' buying power took place under the old farm law--a law that is still in effect. Yet, some would have our farmers believe that in the future this law will do what it has failed miserably to do in the past."", 'Now every farmer knows why his income declined. Agriculture was losing markets. Prices were depressed by uneconomic production which was encouraged by the old farm law.', 'The truth is, this vital problem of markets and surpluses had never been faced head on. Two wars had postponed the day of inevitable reckoning.', ""It was war--World War II--which supplied the markets for farm surpluses that had piled up in the late 1930's."", 'In 1950, another war, this time in Korea, postponed the problem until 1952.', 'Now, clearly war is not an American solution for any problem. At Kasson, Minnesota, two years ago, I pledged that a Republican administration would seek a lasting, peaceable agricultural program.', 'Twenty-one months ago we set out to develop a durable, logical plan. We sought objective, expert advice from practical farmers, farm groups, commodity specialists. We consulted with educators, law makers, food processors. The final result was a comprehensive program passed by the 83d Congress, under Republican leadership.', 'So, at last, we have a program which attacks our farm problem on both crucial fronts--markets and production. We have a farm program geared not to war, but to peace--a program that will encourage consumption, expand markets, and realistically adjust farm production to markets. It will begin the movement toward that full parity in the market place which 2 years ago at Kasson I set as a goal.', 'By removing from normal trade channels a large part of the stocks now owned by the Government, we have reduced their depressing effect on farm prices and price support levels.', 'The program provides, of course, for price supports. They are essential. They are, however, only one of many steps essential to a prosperous agriculture--steps that should have been taken long ago.', ""Now let's review some of the progressive measures passed by the 83d Congress in this general area."", ""First, it passed a new law to use a billion dollars' worth of our farm commodities to expand our foreign markets."", 'Second, this same Congress overcame 30 years of frustration and authorized the St. Lawrence Seaway which will bring to millions of farmers low-cost transportation and readier access to foreign markets.', 'And I warn you, my friends, this list of accomplishments of the 83d Congress is a long one.', 'Third, this same Congress extended social security to five and a half million farmers and farm workers. For years these farmers had been indirectly helping to pay the costs of the social security system. Now, for the first time, our farmers will receive its benefits.', 'Fourth, this same Congress permits farmers to deduct for tax purposes up to 25 percent of their income each year for the costs of many soil conservation practices.', 'Fifth, this same Congress accelerated the depreciation period for newly-constructed grain storage facilities and liberalized depreciation for new farm equipment.', 'Sixth, this same Congress launched a program that provided storage for more than 500 million bushels of grain.', 'Seventh, this same Congress provided effective incentives to wool growers.', 'Eighth, this same Congress gave independence to the Farm Credit Administration and provided for its eventual control by farmers themselves--something that farmers had been demanding for many, many years.', 'Ninth, this same Congress increased Federal funds for agricultural research.', 'Tenth, the administration and this same Congress vigorously advanced the farm electrification program. Loans to electric and telephone borrowers during the 1954 fiscal year totaled $242 million. With this help, telephone borrowers provided more modern service, more new lines, and connected more subscribers than during the four previous years combined.', 'Eleventh, this same Congress passed a law to develop the upstream protection of watersheds by assuring Federal technical and financial help to local groups. And very important, these programs will not be planned by an all-wise bureaucracy in far-off Washington. They will be planned at the instance of local people, with the cooperation and participation of State and local governments.', 'Twelfth, this same Congress made loans available to develop water improvements on farms and ranches throughout America--loans formerly limited to 17 States.', 'Thirteenth, this same Congress authorized loans for drainage facilities, reforestation, and other water and soil conservation practices.', 'Fourteenth, this same Congress authorized the establishment of the Farm Cooperative Service as a separate and vital agency in the Department of Agriculture. This action is in line with our determination to strengthen farmer cooperatives.', 'Fifteenth, this same Congress, working with the administration, has swiftly met sudden crises in agriculture.', 'You remember the terrible drought of 1953 and the help provided by the Federal Government. Tragically, it is true that this year, in large regions of our country, a serious drought still exists. Again we are extending help. In 15 States--in more than 850 counties--we are providing credits and low-cost feed.', 'Recently we worked out with the railroads a 50 percent reduction in all freight rates on hay shipments in the drought areas. This cooperation of the railroads is a valued contribution to the common good. And in your name I thank those railroads.', 'So, my friends, in 21 months we have gone far toward building for our agriculture a foundation of enduring prosperity, in an America at peace. And yet, much remains to be done.', 'We must, for example, do more, much more, for the operators of small farms who in programs of previous years have been too often forgotten.', 'We must advance atomic research to assist and develop low-cost electric power for our farms and increase efficiency in food production and preservation.', 'We must continue to foster conservation of our valuable soil and water resources and improve the productivity of our land.', 'We must prepare for that day when our concern will not be surpluses, but the production of enough food for a gigantic population.', 'We must continue to free our farmers from paralyzing bureaucratic control.', 'We must constantly improve existing programs, adapting them as new conditions arise.', 'My friends, all 163 million of our citizens have an enormous stake in making certain that this program is carried through in its entirety. Your leaders in the executive and legislative branches of your Government are determined to bring it to pass.', 'As we forge ahead with this program, we know that awaiting all of us is opportunity undreamed of but a few years ago. This opportunity is surely ours if we keep vital and strong our unmatched will to advance and grow our individual initiative and our personal freedoms.', 'Opportunity is ours if we continue to reject policies that lead to ever higher taxes, to regimentation, to dependence on a government far from our homes.', 'Opportunity will be ours if we keep a government of teamwork--a government of harmony and good will--to continue the advance along the course charted 21 months ago.', 'We need a Congress and an executive department both guided by leaders of the same general political philosophy. The leaders of both those great branches must be dedicated to the same broad programs and objectives. These are the reasons for my deep conviction that for the next 2 years our national welfare will be best served by a Republican-led Congress.', 'But, my friends, let us--all of us--strive together for that kind of future for America--a future boundless in opportunity, unlimited in rich promise for our farmers, for all of us, for our children. For it is given to us to do our part in building and preserving America--an America whose shining faith and hope and freedom will continue to light the way for all in the world who, with us, love liberty and peace.', 'Thank you very much--thank you.']",1
3,Dwight D. Eisenhower ,"October 21, 1954","['Governor Dewey, Senator Ires, and my friends:', 'I am here, I think, possibly more because I am a voter in the State of New York than I am because I am a--a temporary resident in Washington. So in case anyone thinks that my ballot is secret, I will say I am one of those that will vote the straight Republican ticket. And so, with that out of the way--and, I might add, I am going to do it enthusiastically-- with that out of the way, we can talk about a couple of things here--since they gave me carte blanche--that are from my heart.', 'First, I think there was something started 2 years ago that many of us feel was sort of finished, and that is the aspect of our job that I want to talk about. There were a number of things that formed the battle cry of the Republican Party and its affiliated allies--from parties and independents and everything else, 2 years ago.', 'We wanted clean government. We wanted efficient government. We wanted economical government. We wanted the security of this country looked after. We wanted a program begun in our relationships with other nations that solidified our own security and made the whole free world more certain of its ability to withstand the Communist menace, either in its threat of the use of military force or in its political aspects-the ones that are constantly going on.', 'Those were the main things. There were added programs, of devising farm plans that would not break down of their own weight, of getting the tax structure revised so that it was more equitable in its incidence upon all our citizens, and so it could be used to create more jobs and to make our economy a better place.', 'Now not long ago I was talking to one of my Republican friends, and we were talking about how much of this has been accomplished. ""Why,"" he said, ""practically everything."" He thought things looked well. He said, ""We have gotten rid of the excess profits tax, and we have gotten rid of those terrible controls over our economy--amidst the prophets of gloom, that prices would skyrocket and we would have a terrible round of inflation. The Korean War was stopped and we had all sorts of things happening."" He was very well satisfied. Indeed, he had no real criticism of what the administration and the Congress had accomplished. So he was very satisfied.', 'Well, I told him, to start off my argument, I knew about a man named Firpo--and some of you here are old enough to remember the name. He was a South American, who came up here, and he crawled into the ring one night here in New York, with a man named Dempsey, and in the first round Firpo knocked Dempsey out of the ring and he broke three typewriters of the newspapermen. But Dempsey crawled back into the ring and whipped the tar out of him.', 'Now, as I see it, we have carried the cause through the first round. We have made a tremendous start on accomplishing the basic objectives of that whole crusade, which is: moderate government in this day and time that is fitted for the economic and the social and the political needs of the United States of America. The things we have done have been important steps in getting over to the United States that this is the kind of government that is now fitted to our needs. We reject the extremes of both sides--the extreme right and the extreme left. We believe they are wrong, and we have the difficult task of dramatizing and selling moderate government, one that is attacked from both sides--and I am proud that it is.', 'But it does make it a little bit hard to explain and to sell.', 'Now what I really believe is our job today--the reason that justifies such meetings as this, coming together, to consult among ourselves--is to realize that that job is only partly done, that the great population has not absorbed all of this understanding of what is going on. We have got to go ahead with it. We must not pause along the way.', 'And so we come down to the fact that we have a battle. Now about battles I think I know a little. And I know this: the one indispensable ingredient of any victory is heart--belief in what you are doing, and the determination that nothing in the world will stop you from succeeding.', 'In the Army--or the armed services--we called it morale, esprit de corps, all the rest of it--but it is that thing inside the heart of a man, the heart of an organization, that will not accept defeat, and goes out and wins.', 'I realize that many things are necessary--organization, plans, money. All of these things, as we give them, are merely manifestations of what is in the heart, and how much we believe. How much do we believe that we are really saving the basic principles of the United States of America, the system under which it was developed. And in doing so, we preserve it by adapting all of those principles to the economic and industrial agricultural requirements of the moment--and so we can pass them on sound and unimpaired.', 'Now, if we believe that is our task, where is the sacrifice too great? How can there be too much time to put into this job? Every step that we have made is merely indicative of what we can do. Much remains to .be done, and it seems to me that to entrust our echelons of government, national and State, to the people who have jumped in and carried the job this far, is exactly what we are trying to say and to do now.', 'In Washington we are trying to keep the same leaders. To do that we have to have the same party predominant so that those leaders can carry on in their responsible positions. In the States in the same way.', 'Here in this State you have a Senator who has been tremendously helpful in carrying us forward in Washington, now turning and accepting the duty of leading the job here in the State. And it is tremendously important.', 'I have got just one more word to add. I have probably said this to many of you lots of times. Ladies and gentlemen, again I refer to fighting in its generic sense--contest. I have seen various kinds. I have never yet seen one that was won when the leaders went around pulling their faces up to here. We have got to go that way [demonstrating]. You have got to let people see that you believe in something. You are not ashamed of what you believe in, and that you do not consider your own duty done until not only have you put in every bit of time--the substance--the thought--the heart--the brain that you have got, but that you have induced others to do it also.', 'And that is what brings victory.', 'Goodbye.']",1
4,Dwight D. Eisenhower ,"October 29, 1954","['Senator Williams, Congressman Warburton, Mrs. Martin--my fellow Americans:', 'This has been a busy day for me, one that was fitted into a schedule we already thought was fairly tight. But there had been rumors that came into Washington that people who joined in the crusade of 1952 felt so sure that their program was going ahead, that they forgot that it was time to bring up some reinforcements, that apathy was creeping over the strength of our old crusaders, and it was time to do something about it.', 'Moreover, there was another reason for going out. There are in this crowd, I know, a lot of people who served with me in the armed services. Some of them were undoubtedly with me in the European theater. Every time a climax of the fighting or campaign approached, I found it a very useful thing to go out and see how the men were feeling, the people that had to do the slugging, the people that had to be on the firing line.', 'Now the textbooks used to say that the reason the commander did this was to go out to inspire the troops to fight better. It has always worked differently with me. Every time I came back from those visits, I was inspired to do my own job better.', ""I have found that out today, my friends. By going out, far from finding the apathy they talked about, far from finding any need on my part to tell people, let's roll up our sleeves and get to work, I feel like I haven't been working hard enough. I have encountered enthusiasm, a belief, a confidence, that I wish you could feel. As a matter of fact, I think you do feel it, because you show it here."", ""The only regret I have about today's trip into Cleveland, up to Detroit, down to Louisville, is that there is only so much time in a day, and I could go no further. I would have loved to have visited every single State that I could have reached in 3 or 4 days, to go and tell everybody what I have been seeing--that they are on the march, the crusade is still going."", 'Now I want to tell you one thing about votes. It is this: I think we are frequently apt to underestimate the importance of one vote. It means a lot of things. First, what does it mean to you--you. With your own conscience you have done your duty as an American citizen. You have registered your decision. Whatever it may be, you have done it.', 'But in a more practical sense, do you realize that three Presidents have been elected by one electoral vote, or in one case where it was referred to a commission, by one vote in that commission? And my friends, even more dramatic than that, in the case where it was done by commission, the one decisive vote was cast by a man who in his District had been elected by a majority of one. One vote made a President of the United States. Five states have been admitted to the United States by one vote in the Congress.', ""Now this is very important to me because one of the States was that of my birth, and if it hadn't been elected, I wouldn't have been a citizen."", ""But I want to get over what your one vote can mean, both in terms of your own satisfaction, and in terms of what it can mean in a practical sense, and one other. What does it mean to those around you who watch you and believe in you, have some confidence in you? Joe voted--I'll vote. It is what your example does. Moreover, if I could give you one suggestion, after this meeting--you know, if everybody here in this audience would go home this evening and start calling up, and each would call up 10 voters and ask them to call up 10 voters, and so on, you would cover the State of Delaware with every man, woman, and child in about 2 hours. Think how fast that would multiply. You would reach millions in that time. That is what we want, all the votes out."", 'Now why do Republicans want all the votes out? Because this crusade was put on the road by a vast majority of the American people. That vast majority of the American people still believes the same way.', 'If everybody votes, we are in!', ""Now let's go back to 1952 for just a few minutes. You remember we wanted to clean out the scandals. We wanted clean government. We wanted dignity in high places, and there were a number of other things we wanted. But our real slogan was a very simple and short one. It was peace and prosperity."", 'Now let me speak about that just a second. The important word in that phrase is the simple little conjunction and. Peace and prosperity.', 'For 20 years we were gradually absorbing the idea in this country that you could have peace or prosperity. Our crusade was really nothing but substituting and for or in that phrase.', 'Now to look at it--in 1940 there were still, after years of talk, and a lot of other things, there were more than 8 million unemployed. In 1950, in February, at the peak of unemployment of that year, there were 4,900,000 still unemployed- The average for the year, even though we went to war, you will recall, of July 1950, was 3 million, one.', ""Now, my friends, is it any wonder that we had come to believe we couldn't have full employment in this country unless we got it by going into the armed services or into war plants? If you wanted prosperity, the belief was growing you had to have a battlefield."", 'We rejected that in 1952, and said you can have peace and prosperity. Now, in both these things, I am just going to run over the record, just very briefly, to show you that there has been real progress in peace and in prosperity in 21 months.', ""First, let's take the prosperity angle. Unemployment following upon the end of the war, rose to a peak, last February and March. Ever since, it has been steadily declining. Only this last month--the month we are now in--it has gone down 400,000 more. It reached on my last reports about 5 days ago, 2,741,000. And it is still going down."", 'I do not mean to say that as long as there is any unemployment in any spot brought about by the aftermath of war and inflation, that we are going to be satisfied. Far from it. Unemployment is not just statistics. Unemployment is heartaches, it is privation, it is discouragement, it is suffering.', 'And this Government that you have has a heart, as well as a head, and as long as there is any unemployment, this is going to be a major problem of attack for them.', 'There are worlds of useful work that this Nation has to do. We have great highway programs to build. We still have hospitals to build, and all of the other things in which Federal and State and county and private enterprise can cooperate. And we need have no unemployment even at this level, and we are not going to have.', ""Now let's take other things. Money available to all of us, after taxes, is at an all-time peak for spending. By every measure of production--the construction industry this year, this month, is 25 percent higher than it was this month last year, which was the peak year of all time; the workweek is lengthening in hours, wages are at their all-time high. By every index that we have, it is the most prosperous peacetime year of our history. And I was assured by the President of the Retailers Association that he believed this year would exceed in sales even last year. We are prosperous, and getting more prosperous."", 'This economy is expanding at such a rate, my friends, under wise policies of money management, instilling cooperation in our people instead of domination, that within--certainly within 10 years, we are going to have a $500 billion national product every single year. That will mean an increase of $3,000 per family--of the families in the United States today.', ""We are going up and up. We are not stopping here. And we are going to need all these people that haven't got jobs this minute."", 'Now along with this, while this has been going on, how about peace? Well now, in January 1953 the casualty lists were still coming in from Korea, in that war that was seemingly endless and had certainly become futile and useless. There was a war in Indochina. There was a terrible situation existing in Iran, every day we expected the news that that country, with 60 percent of the oil reserves of the world, had fallen to the Communists. In Trieste, there was a trouble spot that threatened to explode. In Suez was another. In Guatemala, international communism was already trying to establish a beachhead.', 'What has happened to all these spots? Patient work, hard work, intelligent cooperation on a friendly basis with all our partners, has eliminated them. They are no longer threatening our peace. The atmosphere is improved. And along with this, 2 years ago, the situation in Europe was still uneasy and tense. Age-old hatreds and prejudices were threatening to break up every attempt at establishing a coalition that could keep that country secure. It was a very bad situation. Because, my friends, Europe--Western Europe--is not just a country that happens to lie straight across the Atlantic from here, and is of no importance to us except as a place to visit. Did you ever stop to think what would be our situation if the Communists of today, with their great ruthless power, already controlling more than 800 million people, could get Western Europe with its great productive power, more than 22 million skilled workers in great vast industrial plants, all put up in the pattern of the American industrial plan? What would happen, with their great productivity, their nearness to us, their immediate threat to our friends in Britain, and in the African area? We would be under deadly peril, and our expenditures for security would be so great as to dwarf those we are making today.', 'And that, my friends, is all changed.', 'Only a few nights ago, the greatest Secretary of State of our time came back and made his report to you, that this danger has been averted. Western Europe is growing together, is getting into a position where they can support their own troops and can make certain that their security is such that we will not have this threat to face.', 'And in terms of the prospects for peace, this means just this: with these developments around the world, with the new coalition developing in southeast Asia, with Japan leaning our way, with Iran oriented toward us, with this agreement in Western Europe, there is a growing strength that is born of unity--unity in basic spirit and conviction and determination that the Communists dare not attack.', 'Which means we can pursue peace in confidence, standing up straight and not being afraid, not cringing, standing up and saying, here is what is right and here is what must prevail in this world, and doing it from a position of security.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, in this postwar world, the prestige and position of the United States in the world today is at its record peak.', 'I have just one thought to add. In this business of foreign affairs, foreign relations, foreign operations, there must be bipartisanship. Let us not mistake ourselves. No one party has a monopoly on patriotism and dedication to this country. And if we do not have bipartisanship in the main basic threads of our national policy, then with one from year to year, from administration to administration, we would be weakened because of lack of stability of policy in the world.', 'But I must point this out, that although this administration has pursued this truth, and acted in this truth more firmly than any of its predecessors, has had more meetings in determining what these basic foundations of our policy should be, yet when it comes to the day by day operation, leadership is still necessary.', 'There is a team, a team made up of congressional leaders and executive leaders that has been responsible for the operation, the carrying out, the execution, of these policies. And so the question is: since this same team has to deal with our policies at home and abroad, do we now, with this great progress achieved, and so much more still to be done, do we want to break it up, do we want to split this team and make part of it one thing and part of it another?', 'That is what this election is about. Do you want to keep this team together that has brought and is bringing peace and prosperity?', 'So my friends, let me emphasize: when I ask you to vote, I am not asking you to vote merely so that one party can have the great honor and distinction--responsibility--of representing you in Washington. I am placing these issues before you to show you that your vote means the progress in the peace and prosperity--the continuation of the progress they have so far achieved.', 'And that is the reason that you must have a Senator Warburton to help Senator Williams--and in the other House, Mrs. Martin to represent you. The executive department must remain Republican during this coming 2 years--by constitution.', 'When I say Republican, we do not mean that we hope to represent only Republicans, or occupy and fulfill those jobs in any narrow way. We know that it is Republicans, and open-minded independents--and understanding Democrats--that have sent this team of legislative and executive leaders to Washington.', 'Now you send them back, and this work will go forward. That I promise you.', 'Good night. God bless you.']",1

That is to vote--to register his opinion as to his Government and the kind of Government he wants. And I have come for another reason. As most of you are aware, we are in a bit of a fight these days. And I have been in them before--but a different kind.', 'I think there is among this great audience many thousands of people who served with me in the armed services. Those men well know that it was my habit, when battles reached their climax, to try to get down and see what the people who were really doing the work were thinking and wanted to do--what was their state of mind, and how were things going with them.', 'I am out today to try to get as close to the people of this great city, and two or three others, in the few hours available to me.', 'How are we doing? I think, of course, we are doing fine.', 'Now, at such a time as this, there are a thousand things to talk about. There is peace, there is the progress toward a firm and secure peace, there are all phases of our economy, there is every kind of political doctrine and tenet to discuss, if we wanted to cover the whole field.', 'I am going to talk about something today that I think is of particular and important interest to all of you--that is, some of the dislocations that come about as a nation passes from war to peace, and what your Government can and is doing about them.', 'This kind of subject is of tremendous importance to a city like Detroit, because here is centered these great industrial facilities that make so much of our war munitions. Consequently, as we pass to peace--to a peace economy, a greater dislocation occurs here than it does in most places.', 'The goal of your Government, the goal of all Americans, is a strong, stable, growing, expanding economy, an economy that will bring higher standards of living to all of us, greater prosperity and strength at home, so that we can support the kind of military strength that makes us safe abroad.', 'Now for 20 years we have lived under a false belief that the only time America is really prosperous is when she is at war. The only time in 20 years we have had full employment has been at the height of the war years. And we had gotten to the impression that the two words war and prosperity were connected.', 'My friends, if there is one accomplishment that I believe your Government has some justifiable right to brag about, it is that in the last 2 years it has succeeded in working with industry in developing a cooperative attitude that has brought us from a war economy to a peace economy with a minimum of dislocation, and at this moment a growing prosperity throughout the land.', 'Now this outcome does not agree with the predictions of many of the prophets of gloom and doom. Sometimes, it seemed almost like they were anticipating this great and terrifying depression that they predicted with some satisfaction, in order to show that their opponents were not so smart.', ""Now maybe their opponents are not so smart, but when you take America's heart and America's industry and America's working man and work in cooperation with him, he can win the battle of peace as well as he proves so well in war he can win the battles of war."", 'So of course we know that good times in Detroit, in a great manufacturing city like this, demand good times throughout the country. You are a part--a very important part--of the whole economy. And that whole economy must prosper, if you are to prosper.', 'What have we done about this whole economy? The first thing we did, and the first thing that brought down these dire predictions of disaster, was to remove the controls from wages and prices a year ago last spring. And did all the disasters occur that were predicted? Not a bit of it.', 'American industry, released from these controls, functioned exactly as you would expect it to: more efficiently than ever before.', 'And then, my friends, we cut taxes--the biggest tax cut in history-$7,400,000,000. And how was that brought about? By saving governmental expenditures. Governmental expenditures have been cut by more than $11 billion, and that has made possible this tax cut, returning money to the people who we think know better how to spend it for themselves than Government does for them.', ""Within the last 2 years, my friends, social security has been made available to 10 million more Americans that did not have it before. Unemployment insurance is available to 4 million Americans that did not have it before. Great housing programs have been pushed ahead. Today-this month--there's 25 percent more construction going on in the United States than there was this same month last year. This is the greatest construction program in the entire history of the Nation."", 'There has been an expanded program--a regular program of road construction--which has been expanded and made bigger than ever before.', ""A farm program has been designed that will bring to an end the 7-year decline in farm income. Now, since January 1951 there has been a 25-point point drop in the parity index of the farmer. Nineteen of those points occurred before January 1, 1953. And we are still, my friends, operating under the laws that have been on the books for a long time. The new program is not yet in effect. But it will be started next year. We will get rid of these surpluses that overhang the market, and the farmers' future will be a brighter one."", 'My friends, after decades of frustration and effort of all kinds, this Congress and this administration passed the St. Lawrence Seaway Act.', 'The health of the people has engaged the attention of the Congress and the administration. Great new hospitals are being built to fill the requirements of our big cities and our rural populations alike. In every possible way, research in medicine is being pushed in order that we can bring health not only to the wealthy and the well-to-do, but to every man, woman, and child of this United States.', ""Now, by every measure--by every index by which we measure the wealth of a nation, this is by far the best peacetime year of our whole history. And I am quite sure that Americans don't want to pay for any pseudo or false prosperity in the blood of their sons and brothers on the battlefields."", 'Today, my friends, 62 million Americans are working, with good jobs. The workweek is lengthening, the steel output climbing, consumer spending is at an all-time peak. Personal incomes, after taxes, are greater than ever before. Construction is setting record peaks, wage rates the same. Weekly earnings are on the rise again. And the national output exceeds even that great war year of 1944.', ""Now, let's look for a moment at this always troublesome question: unemployment."", 'In this month, unemployment is down 400,000. It stands at 2,741,000, as of my last report, and is still going down. The great employers of this city have reported to me that they are calling back men to work every day, and on October 15, in this city alone, 60 thousand more people were working than on September 15.', 'Now, the number of men and women who want work and are unemployed today is one-third the number that were unemployed in 1940, despite our much greater population. There are not nearly so many as were unemployed in 1950.', 'And how did those people who were unemployed in 1940 and in 1950 get jobs? Because they either went to war or they went into war plants.', 'And we are getting employment without that.', 'Now this does not mean by any means, that I come to you, my fellow Americans, and talk about unemployment in mere terms of statistics. Unemployment is not that. Unemployment is heartache, it is privation, it is discouragement--and we know it. I assure you of one thing. You have got a Government with a heart as well as a head.', ""As long as there is a single American citizen who honestly wants work, is able to work, and can't find it, there's a problem that your Government will try to help solve."", 'Now, as I say, this is the finest economic year in our history, and we are on the upgrade by every index that we have.', 'And I hope you will allow me to mention just a word or two, now, about the subject that I believe is of the greatest importance to all Americans: the growth, the development, the progress toward peace.', 'My friends, 2 years ago, if you will cast back your minds for a moment, there was war in Korea, in Indochina; daily we feared that we would pick up our papers and read that Iran, with 60 percent of the oil reserves of the world, was under Communist domination. Trieste was a terrible problem, causing trouble in a sensitive spot. Suez was another. In Guatemala, communism was already raising its ugly head. And in Europe there was discouragement and disillusionment.', ""All those hot spots have been cooled off. They are gone. They are not troubling us. We don't read about them."", 'And in Europe, my friends, only a few days ago, there came back to report to you, and to all of us, the greatest Secretary of State of our time, on the developing plans in that area that bring to us promise of increased strength in the free world, that we can reside in our homes with greater confidence that this menace of international communism heading up in the Kremlin is not going to be successful in its efforts against us and our friends all over the world. Growing confidence everywhere that we can live in peace, a peace that will grow to be a permanent and lasting and just peace--that is what we are talking about.', 'And now, I have only one or two points I want to mention briefly before I go. I said things are on the upswing. The best analyst in this whole motor field, in which you are interested, says that in December we will be up to a peak production of 615,000 motor vehicles. What a wonderful prediction and outlook on the economic side. We are pushing ahead with a great road program, a road program that will take this Nation out of its antiquated shackles of secondary roads all over this country and give us the types of highways that we need for this great mass of motor vehicles. It will be a nation of great prosperity, but will be more than that: it will be a nation that is going ahead every day. With Americans being born to us--with our population increasing at five every minute, the expanding horizon is one that staggers the imagination.', 'And as, along with that, our economy advances and keeps up with that kind of rate, we are of course, certainly within 10 years, we are going to see a year when we will have a $500 billion income, meaning $3,000 more to every family now existing in the United States.', 'That is the kind of future we are looking for--and we are going to have!', 'And so, as I say goodbye, I want to remind you of this: I have tried to give you a few of the reasons why you should vote. I want to point out the importance of one vote. Three Presidents of the United States have been elected by one electoral vote. One of those had the election thrown into the House of Representatives, and he was elected in the House by one vote. And the Congressman who cast the deciding vote was elected in his District in Indiana by one vote. And that one vote was of a sick man who ordinarily could not have gone to the polls, but he insisted they put him on a litter and take him to the polls where he voted. That, my friends, is some measure of the value of one vote. Five States have been admitted to the Union by one vote in the Congress.', 'That is why we need every voter to come out and make certain that we have a Congress that continues under the leadership that we have had in the last 2 years, to bring about these great things I have been telling you about so roughly and so briefly.', 'That means that from this great State of Michigan we want that part of the leadership. After all, you have the Senator who is the head of the Republican Policy Committee in the Senate body. By all means you must send him back and support him with the big delegation that you are capable of sending.', 'You have nominated great State and national tickets, your Governor, your Senators, your Congressmen, your State officers.', 'Do the rest of the work, and elect them.', 'Please vote!', 'Goodbye.']",1
6,Dwight D. Eisenhower ,"October 29, 1954","['Senator Cooper and my friends:', 'I am on a trip today to remind all my friends in this Nation of a very important duty they have. It is to vote. It is to exercise the greatest right that free government can confer upon a citizen.', 'Now, of course, I would like for you to vote for Senator Cooper and all the rest that are running on the Republican ticket from this State. But above all, it is your duty to vote. So I feel, also, that if there are enough people who vote, we will be all right, because I am quite certain that the great vast majority that voted in 1952 still feels the same way. Now if that vast majority votes again, then we will have Senator Cooper and those like him back in the Senate, and will have a Republican-led Congress in both Houses.', 'Now in 1952 this vast majority was made up of Republicans, and of independent-minded citizens of all kinds. Some were called Citizens for Eisenhower, Independents for Ike and Dick, Democrats for Eisenhower, and so forth. In any event, they believed and were conducting a crusade. And I have thought often of the simplicity of the crusade, the simplicity of the cause that was at the bottom of that crusade. Actually, as I see it, we were trying to substitute one three-letter word for one two-letter word in United States thinking.', 'For 20 years we had come to think of peace or prosperity. And these crusaders said we could have and would have peace and prosperity.', 'Now of course, this was only a change of a small word, but in meaning and significance a change of the most profound importance. All those years from 1933 to 1940 we continued to have very large unemployment; even when we began the preparation for war in 1940 unemployment was still, in that year, at an average of 8,100,000.', 'And then again in 1950, even though in that year we began again the great preparations for the Korean war, unemployment never fell to the 3 million mark. At the peak in that year, in February, it was 4,900,000.', 'Now these people in 1940 who had been without work for a long time, how did they get jobs? They went into the armed services or they went into war plants. And this happened again in 1950.', 'Is it any wonder, then, that the United States came to believe that we could have peace or we could have full employment or prosperity?', 'Now the crusaders said you can have both. For 2 years those crusaders--your representatives in the Congress, in the executive branch, and with your support--have been busy proving that formula ever since. And the record is a great one. It has been brought about through cooperation instead of division within our great economy--within our Nation. Government has tried to work with people, rather than to try to dominate them--rather than to boss them. There has been a new spirit of working together, of teamwork throughout--from the remotest hamlet in the middle of the country right on down to Washington, between the farm and the city, between Government and citizen.', 'In this matter of unemployment, we have seen a steady decline from the peak of last winter. Only this month there was another 400 thousand reduction. We are down to approximately 2,700,000 at this moment. Unemployment is still going down, and employment is still going up. There are 62 million Americans working--working at profitable wages. The weekly wage is still going up. The amount of money left the American people for expenditures after taxes is at its all-time high. Construction is breaking records every single month. Construction this month is 25 percent higher than last year, which was supposed to be the peak of all time.', ""Ladies and gentlemen, by every measure that we can determine the increase in the wealth and productivity of a nation, we are prosperous, we are going up; and this in spite of the fact that in certain areas there still is unemployment. And that unemployment engages the attention of your Government, and its cooperating municipalities and States and industry, every second of the day. As long as there is a single American citizen that wants a job, is capable of working, and can't find it, the Government will never let up on this."", 'We have prosperity--by far the most prosperous peacetime year in our whole history.', ""But now we said also, remember, peace and prosperity. Now by peace, if we are honest with ourselves, we don't mean merely an absence of shooting. We thank the Almighty every day of our lives that no longer do we read the casualty lists from those barren mountains of Korea, and we are glad, of course, that the shooting and the killing has stopped in southeast Asia. But we are talking about progress toward a peace of confidence and security, one in which we can believe, when we can begin to turn the full productivity of this great and prosperous economy to the advancement of human happiness."", ""We don't mean that we have really reached peace when we have to devote--and all the world is still devoting--so much of its sweat and toil and productivity to making the engines of war, in order that we can remain secure."", ""Now what have we done in the last 21 months? You remember where we were in January 1953? We were still losing American boys in Korea, and the fighting was going on in Indochina. Beyond that, day by day we expected to pick up our papers and read that Iran with its great resources, 60 percent of the world's known reserves of petroleum, had fallen into Communist hands. And Suez: we expected to pick up the paper and read that it was going to flame into open disaster; Trieste, bothering our friends and the Italians and all Western Europe--those age-old irritations between Italy and Yugoslavia. And even in Guatemala, in our own hemisphere, the ugly head of communism--international communism--was menacing us."", 'Now, through patient work, through persistent work, through friendly partnership, all of these sore spots have either disappeared or have been so greatly accommodated that they are no longer the dangers that they once were. So that there has been developing a constantly better atmosphere in which the statesmen and diplomats of the world could work for peace.', 'Now, far more important, even, than these specific incidents of which I have spoken, is the better situation in Western Europe. Frequently we ask ourselves, well what about Western Europe, why do we worry?', 'My friends, we know what the menace in the world today is: it is international communism under the direction of the men in the Kremlin, who have announced their intent by aggression, by violence, by any way that is appropriate to them, or feasible or expedient, to destroy free government, to destroy your freedoms and mine, and those of every other citizen of the free world.', 'Now they have a vast empire. Right now they control at least 800 million souls, parts of it very productive. But think of Western Europe: 250 million more people, with a skilled labor element almost twice as strong as our own. Suppose all those people with their vast productivity fell under the domination of the Communists? The threat to. the rest of the free world, specifically to the United States of America, would be so grave and so great that what we are spending now for national defense would be a drop in the bucket.', 'So, ladies and gentlemen, Western Europe is not something that we can say is across the Atlantic. It is right here in Louisville, Kentucky, in its significance to our safety.', ""Now 2 years ago, we had been working for a long, long time to bring about some unity and strength in that region. It looked rather dismal. Prospects didn't look too good. They weren't good. But again, patient work, refusal to be defeated on the part of all the Western allies, with Great Britain and our own country acting as friendly partners throughout, finally the greatest Secretary of State of our time could come home and report to you people that a new spirit had been developing, a new pact was on the way for signature, which would guarantee the security of that nation, and therefore work to the great benefit of the United States and all the free world."", 'Now ladies and gentlemen, most sketchily but certainly I think most accurately, that is a rough outline of how far we have come on these twin roads of prosperity and peace in 21 months. That has been brought about by the cooperation of many people. And particularly in this area of foreign relations, let me make myself crystal clear: no one believes in bipartisan direction of foreign affairs more than I do. In the basic elements of our foreign policy, we must be America--we must not be parties. The world must know that when America speaks, it means to speak for this year and until some great change in circumstances forces America-not some political party--to change its mind.', 'But even in this field, my friends, leadership is necessary. The day by day operation of foreign affairs, the headaches and other incidents that come up that must be taken care of, demand a team of leaders.', 'Now in this whole economic development, this leading toward prosperity, this leading toward peace, you have had a team, a team of legislative leaders in the Senate and in the House, operating with their confreres and with their associates in the executive department.', 'What this election is all about, the one in which I am asking every one of you to vote, is to. determine whether we are to have a continuation of the kind of progress I have so roughly sketched out for you.', ""I tell you, my friends, the traffic of Government must not encounter red lights at every crossroads in Washington. We must all want it to flow ahead on proper lines in the same direction. And certainly, above all means, though two parties can work together, we must not conclude that both can at the same time be captains of the Ship of State. It just simply can't be. Somebody must, and one Party must, be responsible, so that you--you--the United States of America--you voters--can hold somebody responsible."", 'We must not by split Government, give to each Party a chance to. alibi against the other, to give to us excuses for failure.', ""Now, make no mistake, my friends. This decision is yours. Whatever your decision is is going to be loyally accepted by the people that are serving you in Washington. And I assure you, whatever your decision, no less devoted and dedicated will be my own efforts, or the executive branch's effort, to bring about this great prosperity and more and better peace."", 'But I say also: that as long as you have--as you must have--an executive branch in control of one Party for the next 2 years, progress toward peace will be more rapid, more assured and toward prosperity will be more certain, if we do not break up the team at this point.', 'And so I repeat, if we want the crusade that started 2 years ago to be guided through to fruition, let us all vote.', 'Thank you very much for the cordiality of your welcome.', 'Goodbye--God bless you.']",1
7,Dwight D. Eisenhower ,"October 29, 1954","['Mr. Bender, ladies and gentlemen:', 'These are busy days for all of us. I certainly found them to be very busy ones for me. But I decided to make this trip today, in order to urge upon all of us--all Americans everywhere--the importance of voting.', 'The reasons for this are simple. There are going to be great issues decided on November 2d. America cannot afford to have those issues decided by a minority vote. There is even a further reason. I am convinced--I am sure every single Republican is convinced--that the program for which we fought so earnestly in 1952, and was approved by such a vast majority of American citizens, is still approved by that vast majority of American citizens.', 'Consequently, if they only come out to vote, there is no question as to the outcome.', 'I can go to only a few places. I was disappointed to find that limitations of time and space would not let me visit every single State of the Midwest, as I originally intended. But I certainly hope that those States where I cannot go will understand that whatever I am trying to do, applies exactly to them as to any place where I am fortunate enough to meet with my fellow Americans.', 'Now, this State, this is my first visit since the tragic death of the late great Senator Taft. I want to say that during the final weeks of his life-the 12 or more weeks preceding the end--he became my greatest political friend and adviser in Washington. We were very close. No one could have lost more than I lost with his passing. And I could not come here without attempting to pay my tribute to a very great Ohioan--to a very great American.', 'Two years ago, we voted for a very great change. And I think it would be well to take just a few moments to recall to ourselves what was the change we wanted.', 'First, we wanted clean Government. We were tired of hearing the word ""Communist"" every time it was mentioned being called a red herring. We were tired of scandals in the Internal Revenue department, and other places of Government. We wanted clean Government.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, there has been no single appointee of this administration who has been confirmed by the Senate who has later been charged with any kind of wrongdoing, dismissed from the service, or indicted. They have a record of spotless integrity in your service.', 'Throughout the Government, from top to bottom, there has been applied a security program, a security program that is tough and thorough, but is absolutely fair. No man can say that his civil rights have been unjustly damaged through the operation of that security program.', 'And then we wanted prosperity. And we wanted prosperity in a world at peace. We wanted an end to the Korean war. The Korean war, with its futile casualty lists and loss of Americans, has been ended. And following that war, measures were instantly instituted to see that this country should pass from war production to peace production without the terrifying depressions that have always characterized such transitions in the past. This has been done.', 'First we started out and we removed controls from the economy. Do you remember when we said we were going to take off price controls? And the prophets of gloom stated--they said that prices would go out of sight, that food prices, clothing prices, rents, would be impossible for the average citizen? We proved they were wrong.', 'The money policies of the Government have been adjusted to our needs. There has been a vast extension of the social security system, for old age pensions, for unemployment insurance. A housing program has been established that makes certain that every American can have a good home.', 'And finally, we tackled the problem of the farm. For 7 long years farm prices have been dropping. Since January 1951 the parity index has dropped by 25 points, and 19 points of that loss occurred before January first, 1953, when the new administration came in.', 'And even more than this, my friends, just a few days ago I had a letter from my home State of Kansas, and a farmer said to me, ""My income is off this year, look what your program has done to me."" My friends, I am sorry, but we are still operating under the rigid price support system that has been invoked for these many years. No new price support system in the farm area is yet operating, and it cannot operate until the crops of 1955 are in.', 'Then we tackled the problem of unemployment. Now I shall not weary you with going through the long list of things that have been done, but let me give you just a few facts:', 'Unemployment within this past month has dropped almost 400,000. It now stands at 2,741,000, and is going down. But let me tell you something else about this: we have been accused of many things by our political opponents, that we have caused unemployment. Unemployment today is far less than it was in 1949 and 1950; and my friends, it is less than one-third of what it was in 1940. And those people in 1940 and 1950 who were without work got jobs only when we went to war, and they either went into uniform or into war plants.', ""Now, do we want war in order to solve our economic difficulties? Of course we don't."", 'Nevertheless, in spite of all this great progress, I do assure you this: as long as there is a single American without work, who is able to work, and honestly seeks it, this Government will seek to find a better solution than has yet been brought out. We will never give up on this matter.', ""The only thing we bar is: we won't go to war in order to get work."", 'And now my friends, let me talk for just a moment about the great problem that besets the world: the problem of the pursuit of world peace.', 'When your administration took over in January 1953, do you recall the things going on in the world? War in Korea, war in Indochina, Iran threatening to fall under Communist domination, Suez, Trieste--points of irritation, ready to break out into sudden disaster at any moment? In Guatemala, communism already raising its ugly head.', 'Where are those spots? All gone--all gone.', 'But more important than these, perhaps, is this fact: the peace of the free world demands--literally demands--unification and working together in Western Europe. For many years we have been trying to aid in bringing that about. Within the last few days, the greatest Secretary of State of our time came home and reported to us that this is now well on the road to accomplishment.', 'I should say, my friends, that this incident--this development--can well be listed finally in our schoolbooks as the greatest development toward world peace of this century.', 'Now, with all this kind of record, with all this progress toward the things for which we launched that crusade in 1952, let us take a look at the purpose of my visit: the vote.', ""It is easy to say that one vote doesn't count. My friends, there have been three Presidents elected by one electoral vote in the electoral college; and one of those Presidents, my friends, the vote that elected him, because it was finally put in the House of Representatives, was by a representative from Indiana, whose margin of victory was one vote. And that one vote was from a sick constituent who insisted on being carried from his bed to the voting booth so he could register his opinion on the decisions of that day."", 'And there have been five States admitted to the Union by the margin of one vote.', 'Now let me bring this closer to home. How many of you remember the majority by which the Democrats won Ohio in 1948?', 'Well, it was 7,100. And you had more than eight thousand election precincts. One more vote in each election precinct on the right side and you would have been in the right column.', 'Now ladies and gentlemen, I am trying to show you that your vote is important. Not only because you owe it to yourself, to the Government under which you are living, to register your convictions as to the political developments and programs of this country, but because of the potential meaning of that vote in what is going to happen to this country during the years to come.', 'Now you have made the first great step. You have nominated--put into nomination--a great group of Republicans to fill the important positions in your States and in your Federal complement of Senators and Congressmen. With that kind of group to serve you--to represent you--why is there any doubt as to what we must, what we can, and what we will do. And I do not mean, in this case, merely taking your vote up to the poll.', 'I believe that every one of you, this afternoon, ought to call up every friend that you can think of, and remind them of these issues and their importance, and make them agree to remind others, and to keep it going until there will be such a sweep of votes that Ohio will not only be in the right column, but from Senator and Governor and Congressmen, and all your State offices in the right column by such a majority that you will be an example.', 'Thank you very much.']",1
8,Dwight D. Eisenhower ,"November 01, 1954","['Good evening. And now we come again to the end of a political campaign. The candidates have presented their arguments. The shouting dies away. And now it is up to you, the American citizens. Tomorrow you sit as judges on all this, and make your decisions. The farmers, the lawyers, the teachers, the preachers, the taxicab drivers, the miners-- all of us--all of us march to the polls tomorrow, where every single American is the equal of every other American, and there register those decisions that will affect our national life and our personal lives for the next 2 years--and even on far beyond that.', 'Now the decision is not an easy one. Issues are often intricate, not easily understood, and of course they are normally presented from a partisan standpoint. And so each citizen has to decide for himself just where the truth does lie.', 'The fact that these decisions are difficult was brought emphatically to my attention the other day. You know that most of the prayer books in our churches have special prayers for the welfare, the prosperity, the safety, the peace, of the United States of America. I ran onto one that addressed itself particularly to election day. It sought divine guidance for each citizen in making the decisions that you have to make. And we, knowing how difficult those decisions are, can understand the reasonableness of such a prayer.', 'Now the first point I should like to make with you is this you inescapably must participate in this decision. You may do this in two ways. You may do it in a positive way. By that I mean you may vote for the program in which you believe, and for the personalities that you believe will carry out that program. In this way you do your best to see that those things in which you believe for America come into effect as a policy and a governmental program, in the State, in the municipality, or in the Federal Government.', ""Now, you may not vote. Suppose you don't. Then the effect of that is that you double the value of the vote of anyone who does not believe in the things that you believe in. By staying away from the polls, you have, then, participated in the decision; and this means there is no such thing as sitting out an election. There is no such thing as escaping responsibility for your own decisions in this matter, and you cannot escape the consequences of that decision. Either negatively or positively, you are voting for what you believe in."", 'Well, some may say, ""But of course, there is no one that I believe in implicitly."" Maybe so. There is nothing perfect in humanity. And all humans make mistakes and certainly all political parties do. But you can make your decision as to what you believe to be more in line, what program, to be more in line with your own thinking; and certainly you can make up your mind as to whether you will get the greatest prudence, the greatest honesty, the greatest integrity, the greatest businesslike methods and economy in Government.', 'So for now, and for the future, you are tomorrow participating either positively or negatively in this great decision. Now this is very important to you--to all of us--for this reason. From the time we are born and the date of our birth is registered in the governmental registry office, until we are interested in old-age pensions, somewhere along the line we are forever touching Government, or Government is touching our lives. Now just think of such things as schools and hospitals and roads--all provided by the Government in some form or other. The regulation of our utilities-the levying of our taxes--and the value of our money--keeping our money solid, so that people of modest income--like most of us--can be sure that our pensions are going to be worth what we put into them, that our savings accounts are not going to be ruined, our insurance policies will be worth just as much when we finally draw them as when we pay the premiums.', 'So, such other things as social security, and the economic programs that affect the farmer--labor-management--all are intended to prevent depression and the loss of employment. Our unemployment insurance. Measures against subversion. Civil rights programs. And the national security--and all the money we must pour into these military establishments, and economy and efficiency in doing so. Think what all these things mean to you. And then, of course, always, matters of foreign policy and our quest for peace.', ""Now, my friends, if you don't vote for what you believe in, then it is easily possible that minorities--either minorities or pressure groups--can take over and establish the policies for our Government for the next 2 years, and indeed possibly on long beyond that, for you and for your children. But if all America votes, then America will get the kind of Government in Washington, and in your State, that America wants."", ""Now 2 years ago there were 61½ million people went to the polls. That was a Presidential year, and so it is possible we won't have that many tomorrow. But here is a very important point we must all remember: no matter how few people might go to the polls, the rest of us are compelled to observe and honor their decision for the next 2 years. If we did not honor that decision, no matter how few turned out to make it, we would be disloyal to our country, to the ideals for which she stands. We are not going to do that."", 'So, my friends, you owe it to yourself, you owe it to your country, you owe it to your children, to turn out and vote tomorrow. Now, in that way you not only do your duty, you also do this: you exercise the greatest right and privilege of the American citizen.', 'And let me give you one more little suggestion: the other day, in answer to letters from some friends of mine, I called them up and said, ""Why don\'t you call up 10 of your friends and ask them to call their friends to vote. Not how to vote. Just vote."" Now, why don\'t you check up tomorrow and call up 10 of your friends and say ""Just vote."" If you do that, that will be a voluntary act on your part, just over and beyond your own duty of voting.', 'And now, for both Mamie and me, good night.']",1
9,Dwight D. Eisenhower ,"August 23, 1956","['[Broadcast over radio and television at 6:18 p.m.]', 'Chairman Martin, Delegates and Alternates to this great Convention, distinguished guests and my fellow Americans wherever they may be in this broad land:', 'I should first tell you that I have no words in which to express the gratitude that Mrs. Eisenhower and I feel for the warmth of your welcome. The cordiality you have extended to us and to the members of our family, our son and daughter, my brothers and their wives, touches our hearts deeply.', 'Thank you very much indeed.', 'I thank you additionally and personally for the high honor you have accorded me in entrusting me once more with your nomination for the Presidency. And I should like to say that it is a great satisfaction to me that the team of individuals you selected in 1952 you have selected to keep intact for this campaign.', 'I am not here going to attempt a eulogy of Mr. Nixon. You have heard his qualifications described in the past several days. I merely want to say this: that whatever dedication to country, loyalty and patriotism and great ability can do for America, he will do--and that I know.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, when Abraham Lincoln was nominated in 1860, and a committee brought the news to him at his home in Springfield, Illinois, his reply was two sentences long. Then, while his friends and neighbors waited in the street, and while bonfires lit up the May evening, he said simply, ""And now I will not longer defer the pleasure of taking you, and each of you, by the hand.""', 'I wish I could do the same--speak two sentences, and then take each one of you by the hand, all of you who are in sound of my voice. If I could do so, I would first thank you individually for your confidence and your trust. Then, as I am sure Lincoln did as he moved among his friends in the light of the bonfires, we could pause and talk a while about the questions that are uppermost in your mind.', 'I am sure that one topic would dominate all the rest. That topic is: the future.', 'This is a good time to think about the future, for this convention is celebrating its one hundredth anniversary. And a centennial is an occasion, not just for recalling the inspiring past, but even more for looking ahead to the demanding future.', 'Just as on New Year\'s Day we instinctively think, ""I wonder where I will be a year from now,"" so it is quite natural for the Republican Party to ask today, ""What will happen, not just in the coming election, but even one hundred years from now?""', 'My answer is this: If we and our successors are as courageous and forward-looking and as militantly determined, here under the klieg-lights of the twentieth century, as Abraham Lincoln and his associates were in the bonfire-light of the nineteenth, the Republican Party will continue to grow in the confidence and affection of the American people, not only to November next, but indeed to, and beyond, its second centennial.', 'Now, of course, in this convention setting, you and I are momentarily more interested in November 1956 than in 2056. But the point is this: Our policies are right today only as they are designed to stand the test of tomorrow.', 'The great Norwegian, Henrik Ibsen once wrote: ""I hold that man is in the right who is most clearly in league with the future.""', 'Today I want to demonstrate the truth of a single proposition: The Republican Party is the Party of the Future.', 'I hold that the Republican Party and platform are right in 1956, because they are ""most closely in league with the future."" And for this reason the Republican Party and program are and will be decisively approved by the American people in 1956!', 'My friends, I have just made a very fiat statement for victory for the Republican Party in November, and I believe it from the bottom of my heart.', 'But what I say is based upon certain assumptions, and those assumptions must become true if the prediction I make is to be valid. And that is this: that every American who believes as we do--the Republicans, the independents, the straight-thinking Democrats--must carry the message of the record and the pledges that we here make--that we have made and here make, to all the people of the land.', ""We must see, as we do our civic duty, that not only do we vote but that everybody is qualified to vote, that everybody registers and everybody goes to the polls in November. Here is a task not only for the Republican National Committee, for the women's organizations, for the citizens' organizations, for the so-called Youth for Eisenhower--everybody that bears this message in his heart must carry it to the country."", 'In that way we will win.', ""And which reminds me, my friends, there are only a few days left for registering in a number of our States. That is one thing you cannot defer. The records show that our registration as compared to former years at this time is way down across the land--registration across the board. Let's help the American Heritage, let's help the Boy Scouts, let's help everybody to get people out to register to vote."", ""Now, of special relevance, and to me particularly gratifying, is the fact that the country's young people show a consistent preference for this Administration. After all, let us not forget, these young people are America's future. Parenthetically, may I say I shall never cease to hope that the several states will give them the voting privilege at a somewhat earlier age than is now generally the case."", 'Now, the first reason of the five I shall give you why the Republican Party is the Party of the Future is this:', 'First: Because it is the Party of long-range principle, not short-term expediency.', 'One of my predecessors is said to have observed that in making his decisions he had to operate like a football quarterback--he could not very well call the next play until he saw how the last play turned out. Well, that may be a good way to run a football team, but in these days it is no way to run a government.', 'Now, why is it so important that great governmental programs be based upon principle rather than upon shifting political opportunism?', ""It is because what government does affects profoundly the daily lives and plans of every person in the country. If governmental action is without the solid guidelines of enduring principle, national policies flounder in confusion. And more than this, the millions of individuals, families and enterprises, whose risk-taking and planning for the future are our country's very life force, are paralyzed by uncertainty, diffidence and indecision."", 'Change based on principle is progress. Constant change without principle becomes chaos.', 'I shall give you several examples of rejecting expediency in favor of principle.', 'First, the farm issue.', 'Expediency said: ""Let\'s do something in a hurry--anything-even multiply our price-depressing surpluses at the risk of making the problem twice as bad next year--just so we get through this year.""', 'People who talk like that do not care about principle, and do not know farmers. The farmer deals every day in basic principles of growth and life. His product must be planned, and cultivated, and harvested over a long period. He has to figure not just a year at a time but over cycles and spans of years, as to his soil, his water, his equipment, the strains of his stock--and the strains on his income.', ""And so, for this man of principle, we have designed our program of principle. In it, we recognize that we have received from our forebears a rich legacy: our continent's basic resource of soil. We are determined that, through such measures as the Soil Bank and the Great Plains program, this legacy shall be handed on to our children even richer than we received it."", 'We are equally determined that farm prices and income, which were needlessly pushed down under surpluses--surpluses induced first by war and then by unwise political action that was stubbornly and recklessly prolonged, shall in the coming months and years get back on a genuinely healthy basis. This improvement must continue until a rightful share of our prosperity is permanently enjoyed by agriculture on which our very life depends.', 'A second example: labor relations.', 'Expediency said: ""When a major labor dispute looms, the government must do something--anything--to settle the dispute even before the parties have finished negotiating. Get an injunction. Seize the steel mills. Appoint a board. Knock their heads together.""', 'Principle says: ""Free collective bargaining without government interference is the cornerstone of the American philosophy of labor-management relations.""', 'If the government charges impatiently into every major dispute, the negotiations between parties will become a pointless preliminary farce, while everyone waits around to see what the government will do. This Administration has faith in the rightness of the collective bargaining principle. It believes in the maturity of both labor and business leaders, and in their determination to do what is best not only for their own side but for the country as a whole.', 'The results: For the first time in our history a complete steel contract was negotiated and signed without direct government intervention, and the last three and a half years have witnessed one of the most remarkable periods of labor peace on record.', 'Another example: concentration of power in Washington. Expediency said:', '""We cannot allow our fine new ideas to be at the mercy of 51 separate state and territorial legislatures. It is so much quicker and easier to plan, finance and direct all major projects from Washington.""', 'Principle says: ""Geographical balance of power is essential to our form of free society. If you take the centralization shortcut every time something is to be done, you will perhaps sometimes get quick action. But there is no perhaps about the price you will pay for your impatience: the growth of a swollen, bureaucratic, monster government in Washington, in whose shadow our state and local governments will ultimately wither and die.""', 'And so we stemmed the heedless stampede to Washington. We made a special point of building up state activities, state finances, and state prestige.', 'Our Founding Fathers showed us how the Federal Government could exercise its undoubted responsibility for leadership, while still stopping short of the kind of interference that deadens local vigor, variety, initiative and imagination. So today we say to our young people: The Party of the Future will pass along to you undamaged the unique system of division of authority which has proved so successful in reconciling our oldest ideals of personal freedom with the twentieth-century need for decisiveness in action.', 'My second reason for saying that the Republican Party is the Party of the Future is this: It is the Party which concentrates on the facts and issues of today and tomorrow, not the facts and issues of yesterday.', ""More than twenty years ago, our opponents found in the problems of the depression a battleground on which they scored many political victories. Now, economic cycles have not been eliminated. Still, the world has moved on from the 1930's: good times have supplanted depression; new techniques for checking serious recession have been learned and tested and a whole new array of problems has sprung up. But their obsession with a depression still blinds many of our opponents to the insistent demands of today."", 'The present and the future are bringing new kinds of challenge to federal and local governments: water supply, highways, health, housing, power development, and peaceful uses of atomic energy. With two-thirds of us living in big cities, questions of urban organization and redevelopment must be given high priority. Highest of all, perhaps, will be the priority of first-class education to meet the demands of our swiftly growing school-age population.', 'The Party of the young and of all ages says: Let us quit fighting the battles of the past, and let us all turn our attention to these problems of the present and future, on which the longterm well-being of our people so urgently depends.', 'Third: The Republican Party is the Party of the Future because it is the party that draws people together, not drives them apart.', 'Our Party detests the technique of pitting group against group for cheap political advantage. Republicans view as a central principle of conduct--not just as a phrase on nickels and dimes-that old motto of ours: ""E pluribus unum""--""Out of many--One.""', 'Our Party as far back as 1856 began establishing a record of bringing together,. as its largest element, the working people and small farmers, as well as the small businessmen. It attracted minority groups, scholars and writers, not to mention reformers of all kinds, Free-Soilers, Independent Democrats, Conscience Whigs, Barnburners, ""soft Hunkers,"" teetotallers, vegetarians, and transcendentalists!', 'Now, a hundred years later, the Republican Party is again the rallying point for Americans of all callings, ages, races and incomes. They see in its broad, forward-moving, straight-down-the road, fighting program the best promise for their own steady progress toward a bright future. Some opponents have tried to call this a ""one-interest party."" Indeed it is a one-interest party; and that one interest is the interest of every man, woman and child in America! And most surely, as long as the Republican Party continues to be this kind of one-interest party--a one-universal-interest party--it will continue to be the Party of the Future.', 'And now the fourth reason: The Republican Party is the Party of the Future because it is the party through which the many things that still need doing will soonest be done--and will be done by enlisting the fullest energies of free, creative, individual people.', 'Republicans have proved that it is possible for a government to have a warm, sensitive concern for the everyday needs of people, while steering clear of the paternalistic ""Big-Brother-is-watching-you"" kind of interference. The individual--and especially the idealistic young person--has no faith in a tight federal monopoly on problem-solving. He seeks and deserves opportunity for himself and every other person who is burning to participate in putting right the wrongs of the world.', 'In our time of prosperity and progress, one thing we must always be on guard against is smugness. True, things are going well; but there are thousands of things still to be done. There are still enough needless sufferings to be cured, enough injustices to be erased, to provide careers for all the crusaders we can produce or find.', 'We want them all! Republicans, independents, discerning Democrats--come on in and help!', 'One hundred years ago the Republican Party was created in a devout belief in equal justice and equal opportunity for all in a nation of free men and women.', ""What is more, the Republican Party's record on social justice rests, not on words and promises, but on accomplishment. The record shows that a wide range of quietly effective actions, conceived in understanding and good will for all, has brought about more genuine--and often voluntary--progress toward equal justice and opportunity in the last three years than was accomplished in all the previous twenty put together. Elimination of various kinds of discrimination in the Armed Services, the District of Columbia, and among the employees of government contractors provides specific examples of this progress."", 'In this work, incidentally, no one has been more effective and more energetic than our Vice President who has headed one of the great Committees in this direction.', 'Now, in all existing kinds of discrimination there is much to do. We must insure a fair chance to such people as mature workers who have trouble getting jobs, older citizens with problems of health, housing, security and recreation, migratory farm laborers and physically-handicapped workers. We have with us, also, problems involving American Indians, low-income farmers and laborers, women who sometimes do not get equal pay for equal work, small businessmen, and employers and workers in areas which need special assistance for redevelopment.', 'Specific new programs of action are being pushed for all of these, the most recent being a new 14-point program for small businessmen which was announced early in August. And the everyday well-being of people is being advanced on many other fronts. This is being done, not by paternalistic regimentation. It is done by clear cut, aggressive Federal leadership and by releasing the illimitable resources and drives of our millions of self-reliant individuals and our thousands of private organizations of every conceivable kind and size--each of these is consecrated to the task of meeting some human need, curing some human evil, or enriching some human experience.', 'Finally, a Party of the Future must be completely dedicated to peace, as indeed must all Americans. For without peace there is no future.', 'It was in the light of this truth that the United States proposed its Atoms for Peace Plan in 1953, and since then has done so much to make this new science universally available to friendly nations in order to promote human welfare. We have agreements with more than thirty nations for research reactors, and with seven for power reactors, while many others are under consideration. Twenty thousand kilograms of nuclear fuel have been set aside for the foreign programs.', 'In the same way, we have worked unceasingly for the promotion of effective steps in disarmament so that the labor of men could with confidence be devoted to their own improvement rather than wasted in the building of engines of destruction.', 'No one is more aware than I that it is the young who fight the wars, and it is the young who give up years of their lives to military training and service. It is not enough that their elders promise ""Peace in our time""; it must be peace in their time too, and in their children\'s time; indeed, my friends, there is only one real peace now, and that is peace for all time.', 'Now there are three imperatives of peace--three requirements that the prudent man must face with unblinking realism.', 'The first imperative is the elementary necessity of maintaining our own national strength--moral, economic and military.', 'It is still my conviction, as I wrote in 1947: ""The compelling necessities of the moment leave us no alternative to the maintenance of real and respectable strength--not only in our moral rectitude and our economic power, but in terms of adequate military preparedness.""', 'During the past three and one-half years, our military strength has been constantly augmented, soberly and intelligently. Our country has never before in peacetime been so well prepared militarily. So long as the world situation requires, our security must be vigorously sustained.', 'Our economic power, as everyone knows, is displaying a capacity for growth which is both rapid and sound, even while supporting record military budgets. We must keep it growing.', ""But moral strength is also essential. Today we are competing for men's hearts, and minds, and trust all over the world. In such a competition, what we are at home and what we do at home is even more important than what we say abroad. Here again, my friends, we find constructive work for each of us."", 'What each of us does, how each of us acts, has an influence on this question.', 'Now, the second imperative of peace is collective security.', 'We live in a shrunken world, a world in which oceans are crossed in hours, a world in which a single-minded despotism menaces the scattered freedoms of scores of struggling independent nations. To ensure the combined strength of friendly nations is for all of us an elementary matter of self-preservation--as elementary as having a stout militia in the days of the flint-lock.', 'Again, the strength I speak of is not military strength alone. The heart of the collective security principle is the idea of helping other nations to realize their own potentialities--political, economic and military. The strength of the free world lies not in cementing the free world into a second monolithic mass to compete with that of the communists. It lies rather in the unity that comes of the voluntary association of nations which, however diverse, are developing their own capacities and asserting their own national destinies in a world of freedom and of mutual respect.', ""There can be no enduring peace for any nation while other nations suffer privation, oppression, and a sense of injustice and despair. In our modern world, it is madness to suppose that there could be an island of tranquillity and prosperity in a sea of wretchedness and frustration. For America's sake, as well as the world's, we must measure up to the challenge of the second imperative; the urgent need for mutual economic and military cooperation among the free nations, sufficient to deter or repel aggression wherever it may threaten."", 'But even this is no longer enough.', 'We are in the era of the thermo-nuclear bomb that can obliterate cities and can be delivered across continents. With such weapons, war has become, not just tragic, but preposterous. With such weapons, there can be no victory for anyone. Plainly, the objective now must be to see that such a war does not occur at all.', 'And so the third imperative of peace is this: Without for a moment relaxing our internal and collective defenses, we must actively try to bridge the great chasm that separates us from the peoples under communist rule. In those regions are millions of individual human beings who have been our friends, and who themselves have sincerely wanted peace and freedom, throughout so much of our mutual history.', 'Now for years the Iron Curtain was impenetrable. Our people were unable to talk to these individuals behind the Curtain, or travel among them, or share their arts or sports, or invite them to see what life is like in a free democracy, or even get acquainted in any way. What future was there in such a course, except greater misunderstanding and an ever deepening division in the world?', 'Of course, good will from our side can do little to reach these peoples unless there is some new spirit of conciliation on the part of the governments controlling them. Now, at last, there appear to be signs that some small degree of friendly intercourse among peoples may be permitted. We are beginning to be able--cautiously and with our eyes open--to encourage some interchange of ideas, of books, magazines, students, tourists, artists, radio programs, technical experts, religious leaders and governmental officials. The hope is that, little by little, mistrust based on falsehoods will give way to international understanding based on truth.', 'Now, as this development gradually comes about, it will not seem futile for young people to dream of a brave and new and shining world, or for older people to feel that they can in fact bequeath to their children a better inheritance than that which was their own. Science and technology, labor-saving methods, management, labor organization, education, medicine--and not least, politics and government.-all these have brought within our grasp a world in which backbreaking toil and longer hours will not be necessary.', 'Travel all over the world, to learn to know our brothers abroad, will be fast and cheap. The fear and pain of crippling disease will be greatly reduced. The material things that make life interesting and pleasant will be available to everyone. Leisure, together with educational and recreational facilities, will be abundant, so that all can develop the life of the spirit, of reflection, of religion, of the arts, of the full realization of the good things of the world. And political wisdom will ensure justice and harmony.', 'This picture of the future brings to mind a little story.', 'A government worker, when he first arrived in Washington in 1953, was passing the National Archives Building in a taxi, where he saw this motto carved on one of its pedestals: ""What is Past is Prologue."" He had heard that Washington cab drivers were noted for knowing all the Washington answers, so he asked the driver about the motto. ""Oh that,"" said the driver, ""That\'s just bureaucrat talk. What it really means is--\'You ain\'t seen nothing yet.\'""', 'My friends, the kind of era I have described is possible. But it will not be attained by revolution. It will not be attained by the sordid politics of pitting group against group. It will be brought about by the ambitions and judgments and inspirations and darings of 168 million free Americans working together and with friends abroad toward a common ideal in a peaceful world.', 'Lincoln, speaking to the Republican State Convention in 1858, began with the biblical quotation, ""A house divided against itself cannot stand.""', 'Today the world is a house divided.', 'But--as is sometimes forgotten--Lincoln followed this quotation with a note of hope for his troubled country: ""I do not expect the house to fall,"" he said, ""but I do expect it will cease to be divided.""', ""A century later, we too must have the vision, the fighting spirit, and the deep religious faith in our Creator's destiny for us, to sound a similar note of promise for our divided world; that out of our time there can, with incessant work and with God's help, emerge a new era of good life, good will and good hope for all men."", 'One American put it this way: ""Every tomorrow has two handles. We can take hold of it with the handle of anxiety or the handle of faith.""', 'My friends, in firm faith, and in the conviction that the Republican purposes and principles are ""in league"" with this kind of future, the nomination that you have tendered me for the Presidency of the United States I now--humbly but confidently-accept.']",1
10,Dwight D.

We are deeply grateful.', 'Now in recent months, my friends, I have been talking a great deal about the Republican Party as the party of the future. In talking about what we expect to be its accomplishments, we naturally assume that we are going to have the finest kind of individuals that this country can produce in positions of authority.', ""And I want, here, to pay tribute to your two Senators from this State--Senator Hickenlooper and Senator Martin. They have been leaders in what I call Republicanism adjusted to the conditions of modern life. They are progressive Republicans. You have in your Governor the same kind of person; you have in your Republican Members of the Lower House--I don't believe they like that term--the Republican Members of the United States House of Representatives."", 'If an outsider from your State dare through his in-law relationship to make a recommendation, it would be that you keep these people in their present and higher positions for a long, long time to come--and you will be well served.', 'I have urged people going out in this political campaign, that are detailed on the team of speechmakers, to remember one thing: they have got a great story to tell, in the simple unadorned truth.', 'Comparing 1952 to 1956, whether it be on the international or on the internal domestic and economic front, sees 1956 better in every single way.', 'By no means are Republicans stupid enough to claim credit for every advance that has been made in the last four years. But they have tried and have succeeded, I submit, in establishing an atmosphere in government that encourages every single human being to do his best--assured that what he gains for himself will be under his own initiative and that he can keep it, subject to the necessity of paying his fair share of the taxes that his country demands and needs.', 'So when we talk about a forward-looking government, we are talking about the kind of government that does its own part in helping to look after the human needs of this country, and then puts every possible part of this authority and responsibility for doing that in the human being himself.', 'Government does not try to be ""big brother knows better than you do."" No matter what the problem, whether it be in the field of power or the field of finance, or any other field, we believe that the closer you keep government to home, where the people who pay the taxes can watch that money being spent, with their desire to see it spent efficiently and effectively and economically, that is the best kind of government.', 'This by no means denies the responsibility of the Federal government to take leadership in a thousand different directions where by its aid, by its credit, by its position of leadership, it can help to solve these great human problems that still remain before us.', 'That is the Republican Party of today.', 'That is what your Senators, your Governor, your Members in the House of Representatives are now committed to--and are doing. They are doing it for the good of 168 million Americans.', ""No less, they are committed to no group, to no special interest, and they yield to no particular pressure. They have one real motive, only one: Is this measure good for 168 million Americans? If it is, get behind it and shove! If it is not, don't let them sell it to you, no matter how attractive it looks for votes or anything else."", 'My friends, as you well know, I was scheduled merely to bring you greetings. This I do from the bottom of my heart. I thank you for the cordiality of your welcome. I thank you for what you are doing now in this critical period of the election year-making certain that you are registered and ready to vote, making certain that your neighbors are ready to vote.', 'And I say to you this: In this matter of registration and being prepared to vote, let us see whether we can get 100 percent of Americans out. We have no fear of the judgment of all America. The only thing we need to fear--ever--is the judgment of the minority.', 'So, even if someone feels they must vote against us, let us still make sure they vote, because the first step toward the losing of our freedoms is refusing to exercise the freedom to vote. That we must do. Let it be your watchword now, and then when you are sure that everybody has voted, remember this: We have got a story that will convert every discerning Democrat, and we can get their votes after we have got them registered.', 'So, go to it!', 'God bless you for coming out and giving us this warm greeting.

No farmer--nor any citizen--will trust politicians who go to the cities to denounce inflation and come to the country to promise loose credit.', 'And, my friends, no citizen will trust any politician who promises expanded governmental expenditures, reduced taxes, and-at the same time--a balanced budget.', 'So let us--I repeat--talk facts--and begin with a little recent history.', ""For almost ten years, as farmers' costs have gone up, year after year farm prices have gone down. There are two exceptions when prices went up. One was the tragic year when Korean battlefields provided the kind of market that no one wants. The other is this year.

Synthetic farmers behind Washington desks started telling farmers all over again what crops to plant--how much to grow--the amount to market--the price to charge. You know, farming looks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil, and you're a thousand miles from the corn field."", ""So vast surpluses were buried away in government warehouses--those too are the results of politicking at the farmers' expense."", 'Now to the farmer--for all the rest of us--what have these results meant?', 'These things:', 'The value of the government stockpile of farm surpluses climbed to nine billion dollars.', 'The cost of storage alone has been one million dollars a day-none of it going to the farmers--and with farmers helping to pay the bill.', 'And these surpluses, by holding down farm prices, last year cost farm people some two billion dollars.', 'Beyond these things, we must credit the Democratic farm programs with an historic but hardly a commendable achievement.', 'You remember that in 1951 farm prices started back down in the very middle of the Korean War. In late 1952--the war still on--farm prices suddenly dropped faster than in any like period in recent years.', 'Now it takes rare talent to force farm prices down in the middle of a war. I have the feeling that in November farmers will see that that accomplishment gets its just reward.', 'Now you remember where agriculture was four years ago when the opposition political party still had to perform as well as talk. Here is where it was: Farm prices dropping--production unbalanced--world markets shrinking--surpluses soaring--farmers discouraged--and farm boys--many of them--in foxholes in Korea •', 'And yet, some politicians say that--to counteract the poisons spread by the old farm programs--farmers ought to swallow now the same programs all over again.', ""That line of thinking suggests that old story of Abe Lincoln's about a fence and a pig. The fence was so crooked that every time the pig went through it, he came out the same side he went in."", ""Lately it seems some people have gone the pig one better. On price supports they've come out on both sides of the fence."", ""So looking back to our starting point, I'd say we have come pretty far in 45 months. I offer a few facts to support that statement."", 'We freed peacetime agriculture from programs designed for war.', 'We eliminated stifling wartime controls.', 'We attacked menacing surpluses--head-on.', 'We regained many of the lost markets.', 'We helped the lowest-income people in agriculture.', 'We brought social security for the first time to operators of family farms.', 'We refunded to farmers the $60,000,000-a-year Federal tax on farm gasoline.', 'We started the great St. Lawrence Seaway project--the 30-year dream of Midwestern farm families.', 'We built a new program to meet the special needs of the dust bowl and the Great Plains.', 'We strengthened the sound farm programs.', 'And--we turned prices back up--without a war.', 'Now these accomplishments, important in themselves, may mean only a start--but they are a good start--on the great job ahead of us.', 'I have two things to say about this beginning.', 'First, the old price-depressing Democratic farm programs stayed in effect right up to harvest last year. Relentlessly they drove prices down as they had for years before. Eighty-five per cent of the price decline after the Korean War inflation came while rigid price supports were still in effect. Our opponents today are criticising the mess that they themselves left behind.', 'Second, recent developments prove that the clean-up part of our job is well on its way. Now agriculture has assurance again of a good future.', 'Part of that assurance comes from our new soil bank.', ""By stopping overproduction, the soil bank will stop more surpluses from building up. That's a great victory for every farmer and every taxpayer in America."", ""By withdrawing lands from cultivation, the soil bank conserves priceless soil for the future. That's a victory for every citizen in the land."", ""By providing special payments, the soil bank protects farmers' income while we use up the surpluses already on hand. Mark up another victory for the farmer."", 'This year the soil bank is retiring over 12 million acres and earning a half million farmers more than $260 million. When next year it retires 40 to 50 million acres, overproduction will start coming under control. That means better times for every farmer.', 'The opposition had a political field day on the soil bank. I asked for it on January 9. After that, I asked--time and again-for speed. In April the opposition passed a jumbled up bill ruinous to farmers. I vetoed that political grab bag and requested a workable program. This too was held up--hardly by accident--until after spring planting was done. That unnecessary delay cost farmers a full year in getting rid of the surpluses-their two billion dollar millstone. But we moved promptly to shore up farm income until we could make up for the time lost by the opposition politicking. The Administration raised 1956 price supports for wheat, corn, rice and dairy products, and extended the price support program to corn not under acreage control in the commercial states.', ""Now, some in the opposition party have claimed that they thought of the soil bank first. Now that I doubt, but I don't know what difference it makes. Just thinking about it is mighty little help. The opposition had 20 years to pass such a law. Instead they built up surpluses--going exactly in the opposite direction."", 'Now, what about the huge surpluses already on hand?', 'We have worked long and hard to regain world markets lost or dried up when we took office.', 'By June 1954, farm exports were up 4 percent, the following year, 7 percent more; last June, another 11 percent. Last year we moved two billion seven hundred million dollars worth of government stocks--a record amount. That was three times the amount moved in 1952 by our fast-talking, slow-acting opposition. With one exception--cotton--peacetime shipments of farm products are now the highest in 30 years.', 'Now the surpluses are in use at home too. Today five million of our people get government-owned food. Eleven million school children are served by the school lunch program. Low-cost milk is going to more than 62,000 schools. We have greatly expanded these programs. We will expand them still more.', 'All this adds up to one important fact: the toughest problems--lost markets, overproduction, surpluses--are giving way. Now opening up for farm people are brighter peacetime prospects than they have had for years.', 'Other dramatic advances add strength to those prospects.', 'First is our new Rural Development Program to help the lowest income families in farming. This is the first, widely coordinated, massive, Federal-State-Local effort ever directed toward helping the lowest income people in farming. The old rigid price support programs have always by-passed these 1 ½ million families while helping the big farms to get bigger. Now we are helping these neglected families get part-time jobs--easier credit--special training--technical advice--community guidance. This program promises low-income families a better future than they have ever known.', 'In this connection, I asked the Congress last January to study limiting the price support payments to any one individual. You know, some individual payments run over a million dollars. Now the opposition in Congress decided against any limitation--they were really too busy talking about their interest in the little farmer, but it was a strange way to show real concern for him.', 'Next, we expanded farm credit--another reason for new confidence. Our new law is especially helpful to young folks--many of them veterans--who borrowed heavily to start farming a few years back. Today the farm credit program is the best in history. The farm people have more say about farm credit management than ever before.', 'The list of accomplishments goes on--emergency help to farmers and ranchers suffering from such natural disasters as floods and droughts--broadened soil and water conservation-strengthened soil conservation districts--special programs to relieve market gluts of perishables--and expanded research and education.', ""Such are the things we have done toward rebuilding agriculture, so farm families can share fully in our country's prosperity. In that effort we must and do make good use of that valuable tool--price supports."", ""But let's get this point clear:"", 'Rigidly fixing price supports at 90 percent of parity without regard to supply conditions--and so encouraging surpluses that depress market prices--is for the farmer, mockery and deceit. That kind of program compels drastic quotas, allotments, government regulation. It robs the farmer of a chance for full income parity. It is a program for politicians, not for farmers.', ""Full income parity is a full share in our country's good times. In a free agriculture, farmers can attain that kind of parity only in the market place. That's what I spoke for at Kasson four years ago: the attainment of that full share for the farmer--the preservation of a free agriculture. That's what I have been working for. I shall keep on working for it."", 'And the facts show good progress.', 'Today farm foreclosures are near an all-time low.', 'Today more farm operators own their farms than ever before.', 'Today the value of farm lands is at an all-time high.', 'Today farm income is at a billion dollar rate above last year.', 'And the long decline in farm prices has stopped. Prices today are higher than last April when I vetoed the hodge-podge that the politicians called a farm bill. Prices are 7 per cent higher than last December. They are higher than a year ago when high rigid price supports still applied to the so-called basic crops. This, of course, is no final solution. But--I repeat--this is a good start in the right direction.', 'Here are the ways we will continue in that same direction.', 'We will use the new soil bank to its full potential to bolster farm prices, conserve our soil, and balance farm production.', 'We will continue rapidly to use up our huge surpluses constructively at home and abroad.', 'We will maintain price supports carrying the essential principle of flexibility both to avoid the hurtful effects of high rigid supports and to encourage the production of crops in short supply.', 'We will keep the farm credit program, today the best in history, adjusted to the needs of family farmers.', 'We will carry forward our expanded soil and water conservation programs.', 'We will use special programs to relieve periodic market congestion of perishable farm products.', 'We will continue expanding the new Rural Development Program, bringing a real and long-denied opportunity to farm families at the bottom of the economic ladder in agriculture.', 'We will continue emergency help to farmers and ranchers beset by natural disasters.', 'We will keep expanding agricultural research to develop new crops, new uses, new markets.', 'We will continue to strengthen such long-established, indispensable programs as rural electrification and rural telephone service.', 'And we will keep doing all else that is fair and constructive-all that is not political quackery--to bring our farm people the only kind of prosperity they want--prosperity that can be enjoyed in time of peace.', 'This final thought I want to leave with you.', 'Tonight I have talked mainly of farming. But I realize that other things mean at least as much to you and to your family.', ""I remind you of the contrast between today and the life we knew--and the government we knew--four years ago. In foreign policy and in farm policy--in military affairs and in fiscal affairs--in states' rights and in civil rights--in tax policy and in labor policy."", 'Where there was confusion then, today there is sense and order.', 'Where there was laxity, there is integrity.', 'Where there was doubt, there is confidence.', ""My friends, I believe that these facts plainly mark the path of our nation's progress."", 'If you also believe this--if you want to keep on this way, then each of you must do your part to the full in making your decision clear and emphatic.', 'Whatever you believe, my fellow citizens, you know what your personal role in this coming decision must be: To register--to get all your friends to register--to vote--to get all your friends to vote--so that on November 6th your voices--the voices of all of you--will be heard.', 'Your decision can then assure and direct our progress in the years ahead--progress in our farm life, and in our whole national life--progress toward our great goal: The prosperity of our people, strong and free, in a world of peace.', 'Thank you very much, my friends.']",1
12,Dwight D. Eisenhower ,"October 01, 1956","['Mr. Chairman, Secretary Humphrey, Senator Bricker, Senator Bender, members of the Ohio Republican contingent in the Congress, Republican candidates for State office--let me pause here long enough to say I wish for each of them overwhelming success where they are standing for election this fall--and My Fellow Citizens in this great throng and over the Nation:', 'Almost two years have passed since I last visited Cleveland, but I find that even a few hours in this city provide a tremendous tonic for me, as an American. From my heart, I thank you for the warmth of your welcome.', 'This time I am here in the midst of a political campaign--a political campaign to determine what kind of government this country is going to have for the next four years.', 'Now let there be no mistake. There are deep and essential differences in the beliefs and convictions of the two major parties as established by the words of their candidates and by their records in office.', 'Speaking simply and directly to the problem: one of the most vital of these differences is that a dominant element in the other party believes primarily in big government and paternalistic direction by Washington bureaucrats of important activities of the entire nation. Those people have in the past sponsored the Brannan plan and price controls in time of peace. They have flirted with socialized medicine. In general, they preach continuous extension of political control over our economy.', 'On the other hand, we of this Administration and this Party believe that the great American potential can be realized only through the unfettered and free initiative, talents and energies of our entire people.', ""We believe that the government has the function of insuring the national security and domestic tranquillity, and beyond this, has to perform, in Lincoln's phrase--all those things which individuals cannot well do for themselves."", 'We believe that government must be alert--and this Administration has been alert--to every need of our people, especially in those things affecting their health and education and their human rights. A sound nation is built of individuals sound in body and mind and spirit. Government dares not ignore the individual citizen.', 'But we emphatically reject every unnecessary invasion into the daily lives of our people and into their occupations, both industrial and on the farm.', 'Let no one tell you that this difference is either merely doctrinal or fanciful. It is practical. It is real. If affects your lives, the life of the nation today and the life of the nation tomorrow.', 'Now naturally, the busy orators of the opposition deplore-and even attempt to deny--this faith of ours, in you, the people.', 'Daily I read about politicians--some of them candidates for high office--who go about the country expressing at length their worries about America and the American people. They profess to be alarmed, scared, and convinced that in all ways we are slipping badly. They cry that the country is going to pot and only they--prescribing for our ills from the seat of government in Washington--can save it.', 'Now I have a simple prescription for their worries and fears. It is this:', 'Let them forget themselves for awhile, and their partisan speeches. When they visit a city like Cleveland, let them look around at the hustle and bustle; talk to, and especially listen to, the people here. Let these politicians absorb some of the spirit that animates Clevelanders, all of them--whether they work in banks, in factories, in orchards and fields or in kitchens. Their worries and fears of the future of America should begin to sound foolish--even to them.', 'Now, my friends, despite this good advice, I am sure these men of fretting fear and worried doubt will reject my prescription instantly. They want too much to have you believe in the story of gloom they spread. For, you see, they assert that these fancied ills can be cured only if the government in Washington-with they themselves occupying its important posts--runs the entire country, including Cleveland.', 'Now, for a few years in the past, they, and men like them, almost succeeded in selling us this philosophy. But, now the shoe is on the other foot and they are extremely unhappy about it.', 'For Cleveland, and the rural areas in Ohio, and the citizens of all the other 47 States, are not only running their own jobs efficiently, but are doing their part to run Washington. The result is a better America, an America of increasing peace, security and progress.', 'Together, we Americans have moved a long way forward in the last four years. For, you see, Cleveland is not an island of prosperity in an ocean of stagnation. All America has advanced in the past four years.', ""Now that advance didn't happen just by accident. Your Government in Washington has adopted policies that have created a tremendous confidence in America's future."", 'And with that confidence, you people of Cleveland, your neighbors in Detroit and Toledo--yes, all the people of the United States--you have done the rest.', 'You here in this Square, the tens of millions like you all over the country, are the source of this tremendous advance--not a group of bureaucrats in Washington or a group of politicians bewailing the fix the country is in. And how did you do this? You accomplished this by hard work; by investing your money; by sticking to your job and doing a good job. You did it because you had faith in yourselves, in your community, in your country. You did it by using your Government as a servant, not turning to it as a kindly master who could parcel out to you--in its great wisdom--the measure of prosperity it believes you merit.', 'Now the results have been wonderful.', 'The cost of living has been remarkably stabilized--only about 2½ percent increase in 3½ years. During the final six years of the previous Administration the cost of living increase was 20 times as great as that.', 'Today, we have a stable dollar. One man who has powerfully helped to restore its honesty and dependability is your own fellow citizen, your great Secretary of the Treasury, George Humphrey.', 'You have a right--a definite right--to be proud of him. With the late Senator Taft, he has added stature to the Republican Party in this generation.', 'Now, my friends, we have balanced the Federal Budget, and have even made some payment on our huge national debt.', 'We have record high employment--66.8 million jobs in August--and without war.', ""Just before I left Washington, one of the technicians gave me the latest figures on unemployment in the month of September, and it looks like it's down below three percent--almost a record in our entire history."", 'Working people have higher wages than ever--for the average factory worker, 12 percent more than when the prior Administration left office--and this worker has greatly increased his purchasing power.', 'Production of goods and services is at a rate exceeding 400 billion dollars a year.', 'In the first three years of this Administration there were more single-family homes built in America than in any prior three-year period.', 'A nation-wide highway construction program is now under way.', 'Those are the facts--that is where America is today. Now while Americans were accomplishing this--were making these tremendous advances--what has your Government been doing?', 'In virtually every area of human concern, it is moving forward.', 'Government has had a heart as well as a head.', 'Now, my friends, in telling you about some of the things this Administration has been doing, I hope you will not take it that I am boasting. There will never be room for boasting in this regard until there is not a single needy person left in the United States, when distress and disease have been eliminated. I am talking about progress--how far we have gone ahead.', 'Now here are some things the opposition would like you to forget:', 'Social Security has been extended to an additional 10 million Americans--unemployment compensation to an additional 4 million Americans.', 'Our health program has been greatly improved research into the causes of crippling and killing diseases has been markedly stepped up.', 'The minimum wage has been increased, even though my recommendation for its wider coverage was not acted on in the Congress.', ""We have had a 7.4 billion dollar tax cut--the largest in our Nation's history. And despite opposition charges, two thirds of that cut was given to individuals."", ""Sympathetic understanding has been fostered and intelligent progress has been made in civil rights. Segregation has been ended in restaurants, theatres, hotels, and schools in the District of Columbia--ended in Government departments, the Armed Forces, veterans' hospitals."", ""And we have been vigilant and successful in preserving the nation's security--and peace."", ""Now let me say, this peace is not all that we could wish, and not all that--with God's help--it will one day be. Centuries of mutual hatreds and prejudices and quarrels cannot disappear in a few short years."", 'But why this anguished cry of some politicians that we have no peace?', ""Do they think they can make America's parents and wives believe that their sons and husbands are being shot at?"", ""Do they think they can bring Americans to believe that our nation's powerful voice is not daily urging conciliation, mutual understanding and justice?"", 'That is exactly what we are doing in the Suez problem.', 'Do they believe that Americans do not know how strong have been our efforts to dedicate the atom to constructive instead of destructive purposes?', 'Are they so deluded as to believe they can conceal from all our people the steady policies directed toward removing the causes of war?', 'Let them think of these names: Korea, Trieste, Austria, Guatemala, West Germany. If they so think of them, they will realize that they would be very wise to stop this effort of fooling all the people all the time.', 'Not only is this Administration dedicated to peace, but we have established a record in behalf of peace that all the world respects.', 'Now these are just some of the things this Administration has been doing.', 'Let us look for a moment at a simple question: Which Party, in these recent years, has done more to help all citizens meet the problems of their daily lives? Which Party has helped more-not with words, with deeds?', 'As an early demonstration of its concern for the human problems of health, education and welfare, the Administration raised that agency to Cabinet level. Now national health, the proper education of our children, and the human welfare of all Americans are discussed at the same table--and with the same exhaustive care--as such great subjects as foreign affairs and national security.', 'The men of the opposition know perfectly well that one of the main reasons they were thrown out of office four years ago was their tolerance of the thievery of inflation. Just in the final seven years of their tenure of office this economic fever had cut the value of the dollar by almost one-third, damaging the livelihood of the aged--the pensioned--all salaried workers. The opposition did nothing effectively to stop this economic thievery. And they know it.', 'Take the St. Lawrence Seaway. For twenty years the opposition talked about the Seaway. Yet it was repeatedly shelved, by-passed, and blocked. This Administration acted and got the Seaway going. As a result, two years from now, great ocean ships will dock here in Cleveland.', ""All the money the Federal government could spend for this purpose won't hold a candle to the increased prosperity the Seaway will bring to the Great Lakes--to the Middle West. This Administration made it a reality. And they--the opposition-know it."", 'Take agriculture. They--the opposition--had 20 long years to do something for the most needy families on our farms. At the end of those 20 years, they had done nothing--except to bypass the small farmer as they made corporation and big area farming more profitable than ever before. And the Administration\'s new rural development program is the first--I repeat the first--full-scale and integrated Federal effort to help these lowest-income families. Another Administration program enables the small farmer--often a young veteran--to get full and comprehensive credit in financing his farm and buildings and equipment and seed. And he can refinance his existing debts in the same way as any other business or industry. That\'s another ""first"" for this Administration. And the opposition knows it.', ""Now, let's take small business. Just 18 years ago small business people from all over America gathered in Washington at the request of the Administration then in power. They made 23 recommendations--appeals--for action. Yet for the next 14 years--for all the years when the opposition held power--virtually nothing was done. This Administration is the first Administration that has made a major attack upon the problems of small business. And they--the opposition--know it."", 'Take labor. The opposition say that they alone truly care for the working men and women of America and that the Republican Party is really a vague kind of political conspiracy by big business to destroy organized labor and to bring hunger and torment to every worker in America.', 'This is more than political bunk. It is willful nonsense. It is wicked nonsense.', ""Let's see what the record shows about this:"", ""The record shows: Organized labor is larger in numbers and greater in strength today--after these years of Republican Administration--than ever in our Nation's history."", ""The record shows: Not under the opposition's leadership, but under the leadership of this Administration, the workers of America have received the greatest rise in real wages--the kind of wages that buys groceries and cars and homes--the greatest rise in 30 years."", ""The record shows: We--not they--have made the most successful fight to stop inflation's robbery of every paycheck."", 'The record shows that this check upon inflation is most vital-not for the few who are rich--but for the millions who depend upon salaries or pensions, those who are old, those who are sick, those who are needy.', 'The record shows: We--not they--have brought a reduction in the cost of Federal Government and a reduction in taxes--a reduction benefiting, not a favored few, but every taxpayer in the land. In fact, 11 out of 12 increases that have been made in the individual income tax since it started were made under our opponents, while 5 out of 7 reductions were made under Republican Administrations.', 'And now I want to add this simple fact. We have given to our Nation the kind of government that is a living witness to the basic virtues in a democracy--public morality, public service, and public trust. In this Administration you cannot find those ugly marks of the past: Special favoritism, cronyism, and laxity in administration.', ""You have here in Ohio a vigorous exponent of the Administration's program--George Bender."", 'Two years ago I came here to add my voice to his campaign for the United States Senate. He ran on one basic platform pledge--to support the President and his Administration in Washington. In this he has a splendid record.', 'He has done an effective job for this State and for all the States of the Union. He has served with vigor and forthrightness. He has shown us a great dedication.', 'And this Administration is dedicated to the welfare--the peace and the prosperity--of 168 million American citizens. This dedication is equal for all. It is equal for all regardless of race or color or creed--regardless of region or section or of occupation-and regardless of social or economic fortune.', 'This is the kind of government that we have been developing for the past four years.', 'Now the Republican Party does not base its appeal on sectionalism, on playing worker against manager, housewife against storekeeper, farmer against manufacturer.', 'The Republican Party believes that none of us can truly prosper unless all of us prosper. It believes we cannot be secure unless we are strong; that no nation can enjoy true peace unless all nations are free from war.', 'If the Republican Party were not this sort of Party, I would not belong to it. I would not belong to it and I would not be running as its candidate. What benefits America benefits farmers and industrial workers, the school children and the aged, the West and North and South--all of us. We are one people, one Nation.', 'And finally, let me say this to you. One of my chief objectives and my greatest hope prior to taking office was to restore the respect of the American people for the Government of the United States. I think you agree with me that honor and integrity have been the landmarks of all that we have done during the last four years. But much remains to be done in the cause of good government for the future of America.', 'I sincerely and devotedly want to continue the job. To be successful two things are necessary: time; and your help.', 'With your help between now and November, we can gain the time for the next four years in which we can permanently establish an understanding of these truths--in Washington and throughout the country. There will be restored the faith and belief of the American people in our national processes.', 'The confidence of the American people in our institutions and our leaders must be strong and secure, if we are to lead the peoples and the nations toward the lasting and just peace, which we all so devoutly seek.', 'Friends, again I thank you for your welcome and for your courtesy in listening to me so attentively. Thank you very much.']",1
13,Dwight D. Eisenhower ,"October 01, 1956","['Mr. Chairman and my Fellow Americans:', ""Mrs. Eisenhower and I have been deeply touched today by the evidence we have on every hand of Kentucky's famed hospitality."", 'Our gratitude went first to those thousands who came to the airport, and we were especially touched that your Governor should have found fit to come out and led his people to meet us there.', 'Along the roads leading into town, along the city streets to the hotel, in the corridors and in the lobby of the hotel--everywhere--we have had only expressions of warm cordiality which have touched my wife, my party and me. I do thank you sincerely.', 'And may I also say a word about another point that is especially pleasing to me about Kentucky today. There are among you here a certain group who by the wisdom and good sense of the Kentucky Legislature are going to vote one Presidential election before they otherwise could have done so.', 'I know that those young people will show their appreciation of that priceless privilege coming to them this early, by voting in every single election for whatever office may be at stake, and continuing to vote as long as you have the strength to get to the polls.', 'Now, my friends, four years ago you gave me a job to do.', 'The job was to establish for America a new direction.', 'You--the American people--wanted to turn away from policies of the past that had meant only trouble or torment for our Nation--a drifting war, and racing inflation--bigger federal spending and heavier federal taxation. You were tired of needless governmental controls and recklessly unbalanced budgets-the building up of political power, and the tearing down of political morality, in Washington. And you were thoroughly sick of the perpetual atmosphere of uncertainty, anxiety and crisis.', 'And so the job was clear. It was to set America firmly on the new road--toward secure peace based on justice--and toward lasting prosperity, widely shared. This is the road of freedom in the life of the individual--and integrity in the life of the government.', 'This is the road of harmony and balance and progress among all the constructive forces of our land--Federal, State and local government, private enterprise, labor--and, above all, the millions of self-reliant Americans.', 'We have come a long way in this new direction.', 'Today there is a lot of work still to be done--which is not surprising. What is surprising, however, is that there still seem to be some who would like to go back to the old road--the zig-zag directionless road of trial and error, the road that was not really a road at all, but an endless series of detours around crises--leading nowhere.', 'Now, my friends, I must frankly admit one thing. I cannot find the choice--the choice between going forwards or going backwards--a very hard one to make. I have never found it so in all my experience--in whatever part of the world I have tried to serve my country, in whatever office I have held. But it does seem that a lot of politicians--especially at this time of year-regard it as their main business to make simple choices seem extremely hard.', 'Now I wish tonight to answer three basic questions:', 'What is the job to be done?', 'How much of that job has already been done?', 'How do we get the rest done?', 'So we begin, really, with this question: What do we want this country to be like as the next four years unfold?', 'Let me give you some highlights of the picture that I keep constantly before me.', 'I see an America in which every man can eat his own bread in peace, raise his own family in security, and strengthen his own spirit and mind in dignity.', 'This will be an America where there are more than 70 million jobs at good wages.', 'An America where the schoolroom shortage is erased--where ever child can go to a good school, and every young talent can be developed to the full.', 'An America in which farm surpluses no longer crush down farm prices--and the farmer.', 'And this--incidentally--means an America where no politician any longer can treat the farmer himself as a product to be bid for in the political market place.', 'I see an America where intensive medical research has conquered some of our most killing and crippling diseases.', 'An America where every family can afford and find a decent home.', 'An America where a mighty network of highways spreads across our country--and where ocean ships sail into the ports of the Great Lakes, bringing a fresh surge of progress and growth.', 'An America where long and costly strikes will be rare--where older workers will be hired entirely on the basis of ability--and where local unemployment problems will be attacked by special programs of financial and technical aid.', 'An America where we shall see the benefits of our recent action to conserve our soil and water resources--while abundant new supplies of power will be unleashed for our surging industrial growth.', 'An America where the greatest possible government efficiency allows the lowest possible government costs--and, hence, lower taxes.', 'And this--incidentally--will mean an America whose government is not run by politicians who think that the way to lower taxes is to increase expenditures. Our way--to reduce expenditures--is very old-fashioned. But it has one important advantage--it works.', 'An America where special laws will have improved and protected the competitive position of small business--so vital to our free economy.', 'And an America where our troubled period of adjustment to the practical meaning of equal opportunity, without regard to race, will have largely given way to a new spirit of understanding and harmony.', 'All of this means, finally, an America fully armed--materially and spiritually--to lead the free nations of the world. For our prosperity and our strength are necessary to serve not only our own comfort and security--but the hopes and needs of free men everywhere.', 'Now we come to our second key question: how much of this job already has been done?', 'Now I shall be blunt and very truthful: I am proud of the record to date.', 'And permit me, please, to explain why I speak of such pride. It is not to make a political boast--or to ask praise for the performance of duty.', 'I speak of it because our past performance is the evidence that we can and will do the job that remains to be done.', 'There is one simple proof of this point.', 'Most of the items I have just listed in our hopes and plans for the years just ahead are already backed up by specific laws enacted, or bills in Congress--based on my last three Messages on the State of the Union.', 'This, then, is not a set of glittering phrases coined in the frenzied weeks of a political campaign. This is a working plan of action.', 'Let us look at a few examples.', 'Before all else--in our hearts and in our deeds--comes our quest of peace. In Korea, long since, the guns have been stilled--and in America, the casualty lists have ended. The road to secure world peace, obviously, merely began with the Korean armistice. But it did begin. And there have been no more Koreas--anywhere in the world.', 'What about our progress at home?', 'As to jobs: I have just received the figures for the month of September just since I have arrived in your city. There were more people employed throughout our country than in any other September in our history. The figure is 66 million, 100 thousand.', 'There were 700 thousand more people employed in August, and I suppose the opposition will try to make something of this point, but the fact is that those 700 thousand were almost entirely made up of young people who gave up their temporary summer employment to return to school.', 'What is even more encouraging, unemployment for September dropped to a rate lower than in any peacetime September during the twenty-year rule of the opposition party.', ""So, there's the record! More employment in any September in our history, and less unemployment than any peacetime September during the entire twenty-year rule of the opposition."", 'Now as to wages: I realize that averages do not mean too much to any one individual. But the fact is that the worker in our factories today is making an average of $12 a week more than he did in August 1952. Most of this is clear gain because taxes have been reduced, while the cost of living has increased less than 3 percent.', 'As to farm prices: Except for the Korean war years, this will be the first year since 1947 when farm prices have gone up.', 'As to homes: More homes have been built in the last three years than in any previous three-year period.', 'As to transportation: The huge, new interstate highway network is already under construction. And so is the St. Lawrence Seaway--after about 30 years of talk and delay.', 'As to older workers: We have been carrying on a new Federal-state project to help older workers get jobs. We have launched a whole new array of special housing, health, and other programs for retired or aging persons.', 'As to small business: We created the Small Business Administration. And we have substantially increased the share of defense contracts going to small business.', 'As to government efficiency: Our Federal civilian payroll in June 1956 was 167,300 less than at the end of the preceding Administration. We have cut taxes by $7.4 billion, with about two-thirds of the cut going directly to individuals.', 'And, we have balanced the budget.', 'A great cooperative effort was launched to improve earning opportunities in low-income rural areas. A special campaign is in force to improve the working conditions and regularity of income of migrant farm laborers. The rate of rehabilitating handicapped workers--and finding useful employment for them--has reached an all-time high. And assistance to the aged--in such forms as increased medical aid--has been improved beyond any programs known in the past.', ""Now, as to social security: We made coverage virtually complete by bringing in 10 million more people--and we put through the biggest real increase in benefits in the program's history."", 'As to civil rights: Genuine progress has been made in eliminating racial segregation and inequality of opportunity--in all area. of direct federal responsibility. This has applied to the of Columbia--government departments--the armed forces-and government contracts with private industry.', 'These are a few of the actions taken that clearly mark our direction.', 'They also give a background of clear fact to enable us to judge some of the political oratory heard these days. This oratory, at its most reckless, has plunged to the wild extremes of charging this Administration with such fabulous failings as not guarding the peace--and not caring for the welfare of any humble citizen or any needy family in our land.', 'We should not, perhaps, be too much surprised at such talk.', 'We all know that there are people who suffer from living in a world of words and phrases for so long that they can no longer recognize action when they see it.', 'And--when it comes to a really critical matter like political leadership--we recall a fact that all of us have seen in our daily lives: the longest lectures almost always come from those with the least experience.', 'Our third and final question is: How do we get on with the rest of the job?', 'The first thing to do is clear. It is for the people to elect a Republican Administration and to send to Washington men like John Sherman Cooper and Thruston Morton. Here are two men who have proved themselves not merely by what they have said, but by what they have done. Here are two men who deeply believe in the principles and ideals of the new direction of our Nation.', 'We need again John Robsion and Eugene Siler in the House of Representatives, and I hope you will send there also Mr. All-American ""Wa-Wa"" Jones, and along with him Scott Craft, Jule Appel, R. B. Blankenship and Basil Preston.', 'With the help of such men, we can then begin by going to work on some unfinished business in our program which has been blocked by the opposition in Congress.', 'One or two examples.', 'Most urgent of all is the problem of our schools.', 'Here let us get a few simple facts straight.', 'Our serious schoolroom shortage has actually been somewhat reduced in these last years--with the building of more classrooms in these four years than in the preceding twelve. This local and state action, however, has not been enough. I therefore called upon the last Congress to enact a two billion dollar program of Federal grants and other aids for school construction over a five-year period.', 'I insisted that Federal aid be distributed to States on the basis of need. Moreover, I insisted that this aid be over and above what the States are now doing--and that the States themselves match the Federal funds. These requirements are essential if we are realistically to take up the critical lag already existing-rather than merely to keep step with new and growing needs.', 'As for the opposition: not one of its proposals met these simple, vital requirements. Now--within the last week--we see the strange spectacle of an apparently confused candidate of the opposition supporting the principles of the bills that we proposed--and that his party defeated.', 'There was only one clear vote, my friends, on my call for action. In the House, the opposition voted against it by 215 to 9--while three-fourths of the Republicans voted for it. In the Senate, the opposition never allowed it to get to a vote.', 'As a result, we have now lost one out of five precious years. To meet this, I see only one answer--to stick to our determination to get the schools we need--on schedule.', 'I shall accordingly call upon the next session of Congress to enact legislation that will do the job--not in five years--but in four.', 'There is other unfinished business to which I shall return.', 'I shall call--again--for financial and technical aid to areas suffering chronic local unemployment.', 'I shall call--again--for extension of the federal minimum wage law to great numbers of working men and women who today do not have its protection.', 'I shall--again--call for grants to states to expand and strengthen their programs for occupational safety. I called for this action by the last session of Congress. And the opposition Congress refused even to hold a hearing.', 'And I shall call for further help to small business with some dozen specific recommendations for action.', 'These are just a few examples of the specific tasks ahead.', 'But most important of all--in getting on with the job--is our understanding of one general principle: the need always to encourage the full and free energies of labor and industry, of private organizations and individual citizens. These are the energies that make America prosper and grow.', 'My friends, to turn back now to the unsound, inflationary, antibusiness, heavy-tax, heavy-spending, government-interference, centralized-control policies--from which this country has so recently been rescued--could reverse all the progress we have made. Surely this is a risk that it would be foolish to run.', 'Let me, at the same time, make one thing absolutely clear: where the job before us, or any part of it, is one that only the Federal Government can do effectively--this government must and will act promptly.', 'When I spoke to you from San Francisco, I said there was within our reach a new world of good life, good will, and good hope. We have made real progress toward such a world. For we have found--and are following--the new direction of our Nation.', 'We still have a distance to go. It can be an exciting journey, a satisfying journey, a confident journey--for we know where we are going. And we know how to get there.', 'Four years ago, my friends, we set out to do a job together.', 'When I think of the America that we would like to see by 1960, I say: let us get on with the rest of the job.', 'Thank you very much.', '[After an ovation the President added--]', 'May I say just one word, my friends. I want to leave with all of you my special word of thanks to Dr. Peterson and the officers, trustees and faculty, and the student body of the University, for making this magnificent hall available to us at this meeting tonight.', 'Thank you very much.']",1

I can't tell you how deeply touched Mrs. Eisenhower and I are by your kindness in coming out to greet us here in Lexington. We were particularly touched by the fact that your Governor himself took the trouble to come out to the airport and greeted us as we got off the plane."", 'But to all of you our thanks go out for the cordiality of your welcome.', 'I should say one word before I leave here. At the bottom of the steps I met three youngsters who had on ribbons called ""First Voters.""', 'I can\'t tell you how happy I am that there is another State that has joined the ranks of those that said, ""If you\'re old enough to fight you\'re old enough to vote.""', 'Thank you very much and goodbye.']",1

But I am going to make one observation that I think might be helpful in all your political work, including the always irksome job of providing the wherewithal.', 'I am often asked what is the difference between this country now and in 1952. I have given a lot of thought to it, and I will tell you: the biggest difference, at least so far as my heart and mind show it, is this: We are just happier. We are just a happier nation.', 'Now, anybody that has had anything to do with great organizations of any kind, military or civil, knows that this is a terribly important fact, because here is morale.', 'What is a happy crowd? A battalion or a company where they say, ""Hi Boss."" It\'s an outfit that has confidence in itself and knows it\'s going places. It just strikes me that if I had the task of organizing and raising the money, and I started to talk to my prospect, I would say, ""How much happier are you than you were four years ago?"" And then I would show him what it meant, that he is a man of self-confidence, that he has confidence in his country, which is the organization that you are talking about at the moment. He believes that country is going places.', 'I think that is the most important thing that we can compare-our country--in that phase of our life, when we talk about 1956 and 1952.', 'And that being the case, think what 1960 can be! Thank you and goodbye.', '[The President then spoke to a group in an adjoining room]', ""As you know, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to make a speech tonight and certainly I don't want to inflict myself in the role of speaker on any group twice in the same evening, so I am not going to make a speech."", 'I am going to tell you a little story I told to a group of Republican workers in Lexington, Kentucky. They liked it so well that two or three of them wrote me a note that I ought to tell it everywhere. It is this:', 'The Republican workers apparently have a job of explaining themselves to their prospects that they want to vote our way, and they accordingly have to find out the reasons that any prospect may be thinking of voting another way.', 'So this Republican worker walked up to a man on the street and he said, ""I would like to talk a little politics to you, and I would like to start out by asking you whom you are going to vote for next time?""', 'The man said, ""I am going to vote for Stevenson, of course.""', 'Well, that sort of settled the Republican back on his heels and he thought it over a minute, and he said, ""Of course, that\'s your privilege, you are a free-born American citizen, and I acknowledge that, but would you mind telling me the reasons?"" ""Not at all,"" he said. ""It\'s perfectly simple. I voted for him four years ago, and everything has been wonderful ever since.""']",1
16,Dwight D. Eisenhower ,"October 09, 1956","['Senator Martin, Senator Duff, members of the Pennsylvania Republican Delegation from the Congress, My Fellow Citizens:', ""My first task as Mamie Eisenhower's husband is to bring to you a message from her. She is most regretful that she has fallen prey to a cold the like of which seems to be very prevalent in Washington and she is missing one of the trips she had looked forward to very much. She asked me to express her regret."", 'My friends, I am here tonight to do some plain talking.', 'Now, there is one thing that is not an issue in this campaign. It is this: the longing of all Americans for peace, prosperity and progress. No one in this country of any political party--is against peace. No one is against progress, and certainly no one is against prosperity.', 'What then is the real issue? It is this: what principles--what policies and programs--can best help our people to gain and to guard these blessings?', 'How shall we debate this issue? I do it with this conviction: what matters in a democracy is not how loudly our leaders speak-but how responsibly--not how big their promises are--but how honest.', 'And I--for one--am tired of talk about ""high roads"" and ""low roads,"" when there is only one road worthy of American intelligence-and that is the road of truth.', 'Our great concerns, of course, are: the prosperity of our nation, the progress of our people, the peace of the world. And our prayer, as a people, is that we may know these blessings--all at the same time.', 'For a whole generation, this has rarely been true.', ""In the 1930's we knew peace--a troubled peace--but few of us knew prosperity: and so there was little progress."", ""In the 1940's most of us knew prosperity--but there was little peace: so again our progress stalled. And no sooner was Nazi-ism destroyed--than Communist aggression was on the march."", 'Now--after the events of the last four years--I believe a new hope rises in all of us: we can, in the years just ahead, know the blessings of peace and prosperity and progress all at the same time. But one thing is plain: it will not come by happy accident or lucky coincidence. It can come only by firm and true principles and policies--by hard work--and, as the times may demand it, by sacrifice.', 'So the issue is--not how we dream about meeting the future-but how we plan to master it.', 'II.', 'The record of this Administration is now before the American people. It consists of almost four years of solid accomplishments.', 'Now there is also before the people a second record--the record of what our political opponents have been saying these last many weeks.', 'Now I must refer briefly to this verbal record of theirs. Frankly I dislike wasting time in taking notice of political charge and accusation. But when partisan oratory has concealed or twisted the facts, I deem it a duty to you to call it to your attention.', 'Let me give you a few specifics.', 'They say that your government of today cares only for ""big business""--nothing for ""small business.""', 'Now what are the facts? The fact--the testing fact--is that the enforcement of anti-trust laws has never been more strict and effective than in these last four years. Last year, the year 1955, a total of 54 new anti-trust actions were begun by your government.', 'The fact is that we--not they--created the Small Business Administration as an independent peacetime agency of government. The fact is that the share of defense contracts going to small business during the last three fiscal years is well above the three preceding years.', 'Now they say that your government has done nothing to check inflation.', 'What are the facts? The cost of living soared almost 50 percent in the last 7 years of the prior Administration--and it has risen less than 3 percent under this Administration. Now, my friends, with the record of this contrast before the people--I should think the opposition would be the last ones to talk about inflation.', ""Now they say that your government has ignored our children's need for education."", 'Again, the facts. Not once but twice, in my State of the Union messages of 1955 and 1956, I urged swift action by Congress. For the first time in our history the Federal government called a great assembly of educators from all over the country to help develop a school program; the plan I submitted to Congress reflected their wisdom and experience. That 5-year program was rejected by the opposition. One fact in this thing is quite clear and simple: this Administration urged action--and the opposition controlling the Congress produced nothing. And now, I propose to urge the next Congress to get this job done--not in five--but in four years.', 'Next--in their political oratory--we find a whole series of curious statements falsely implying that this Administration cares nothing for the man that they rather patronizingly call ""the little fellow.""', 'Now, by the way, who has the right to call any American the ""little fellow""? Doesn\'t the word ""American"" still mean that we are all equal?', 'They say your government is indifferent to labor. They say your government is negligent in social security, indifferent to the unemployed.', 'This amounts to saying that your government has no interest in the people of America. This amounts to the charge that your government has betrayed your trust. Such talk is political irresponsibility at its worst.', 'I wonder just what kind of political children they think the American people are? And I also wonder what kind of man they think I am?', ""Now again, let's look at some pertinent facts."", ""Labor's share in our national income today is 70 cents out of every dollar--a record high for the last 20 years."", 'Labor unions have grown to their greatest strength--and won their best contracts--in all the history of American labor.', 'Social security has been extended to include 10 million more workers.', 'Federal programs to advance the health of the American people have been expanded and improved as never before in our history.', 'Unemployment insurance has been extended to 4 million more workers--and its benefits increased by the States--at our urging-for many more millions.', 'My friends, this last month, just this last September, the unemployment rate in America was the lowest it has been in the whole last twenty years.', 'And finally: these political orators offer us this bundle of things. They promise bigger government spending on every front--lower taxes for every citizen--all wrapped up in the bright package of a balanced national budget.', 'Now these contradictions inspire one comment. Many people have said--and I agree--that this Administration marches politically in the ""middle of the road."" Obviously, any political opposition has a natural right to try to pass us on this road--by going either to the right or to the left. But there is one thing that is not natural, for the simple reason that it cannot be done: to pass on both sides at the same time.', 'III', 'Now, my friends, I turn with considerable relief from the record of this clattering campaign oratory--to the record of this Administration--and to the progress of our country.', 'I need not recite the details. They are written plainly across the land we live in. But this truth I repeat: the facts of this progress are not political or economic accidents. Each is based upon specific principles and policies.', 'I give only a few examples.', 'How and why has the number of civilian jobs increased since 1952 at a rate twice the pace of the preceding four years?', 'It has not been done by fabulous Federal spending--for spending has been cut by billions. It has been done by encouraging the skills of American labor and the power of American industry--to enrich the lives, not of a favored few, but of all Americans.', 'How and why have we been able to check the rise in the cost of living?', 'It is done by applying sense and thrift and discipline to our costs and our fiscal policies. This is the very foundation of a sound dollar. And remember, a sound dollar is vital--not for the rich, who may afford the loss of inflation--but for every citizen looking ahead to social security payments--in sound dollars.', 'How and why have we been able--in other ways--to help labor toward such great progress and strength?', 'It has not been done by using government power as a substitute for good faith in labor-management relations--as when the previous Administration tried to take over the steel industry in 1952. It has been done by respecting free collective bargaining--and respecting the men who do the bargaining.', 'Now these few simple examples make one thing clear. There is a basic conflict between our policies and those of the opposition.', 'They stand for: bigger government costs and spending beyond revenue--therefore, loose handling of the dollar--therefore, inflation-and, inevitably, centralized Federal power.', ""We stand for: economy in government--stabilized living cost-and the citizen's greater freedom from Federal intervention in his work and life. My friends, we stand equally for effective governmental action in all phases of our national life where Federal action can best do the job. Now, out of these broad principles of government grows our partnership policy among Federal, State and local governments."", 'And we believe--in these last four years--we have proved our case.', 'One of the stalwarts who has assisted this Administration right straight through has been your own Senator Duff, whom I expect you to return to the Senate this fall.', 'Representatives John Saylor, Jim Fulton, Bob Corbett--and I notice here this evening also Dick Simpson, have also been helpful. And before I leave this point, may I ask you also, as Pennsylvanians, to send down to help them, your new and young candidates Herb Morrison, Sid Lockley, Willits McCaskey, Dick Witt and Ross Walker.', 'IV.', 'Now, my friends, as we have prospered, we have vigorously pursued our greatest quest. For all things in life would mean little--without the faith that we, as a people, were on the road to peace--a peace of justice in a world of law.', 'For many of us, the hopeful turning in that road seemed to come three years ago. That was the moment when death--death in the mountains of Korea--no longer cast its shadow across the homes of America.', 'Yet that moment marked--not the end--but the beginning of our struggle for peace. For though the guns are stilled, yet true peace--a peace in which all peoples of the world may confidently trust--means much more than this.', ""It means a world in which all of man's toil serves his advancement--not his destruction."", 'Some of the ways in which we have been waging this struggle:', 'We have been helping other peoples in the world to save or to regain their own freedom.', 'We have been perfecting our own military strength--making it so effective and so efficient that our free economy can sustain it for however long we live in peril.', 'And we have made clear to all peoples that America seeks strength only because America loves peace. The meeting at the Summit of Geneva made this clear, a fact that later the Presidents of all the Americas, meeting in Panama, recognized and applauded. There have been other clear proofs of our purpose: our plans for world disarmament--programs of atoms-for-peace--the fostering of world trade--and helping other peoples combat poverty and need.', 'We have--in all this--simply paid attention to some plain lessons of recent history. They are:', 'Weakness invites aggression. Strength stops it.', 'And our determination to resist aggression must be made plain before--and not after--the event. For the first you can do with peaceful acts and policies. But the second you can do only with guns.', 'So, in all our work for peace, we have constantly sought to strengthen our alliances--and our understanding--with all our friends in the world. Through meetings and constant correspondence with leaders of the other free nations--many of them my personal friends--I have tried to consolidate our common purpose. For this road to peace is one that all of us can travel-else none can do so.', 'My fellow citizens, these matters should always be studied exhaustively and discussed soberly in our democracy.', 'Here--again--I must mention what the opposition has been saying only because it is so vital that we all understand these matters clearly.', 'They--the opposition--have urged stout military defense with greater reliance on modern weapons--but have advised stopping our atomic tests.', 'They have promised national security and a bold role in world affairs--while they urge us to start thinking about ending the military draft.', 'Now I, my friends, as your President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, cannot and will not make proposals contrary to national interest--nor offer you attractive prospects if they are unjustified by world realities.', 'I will not promise that winning a peace based on justice will be cheap and easy.', 'The issue of our military draft is no matter of a technical point to be scored in a political debate. It is a matter of the safety of our nation.', 'Why?', 'Because we need the manpower.', 'Because we cannot pretend that rockets and bombs make brains and hands obsolete.', ""Because our future military burden must not be borne always and entirely by veterans who have already earned their nation's gratitude."", 'Because we cannot encourage our allies in the world to shoulder arms--while we throw down our own.', 'Now, let me say, the truth before us is clear.', 'Strong--we shall stay free.', 'Weak--we shall have only our own good intentions to be written as our epitaph.', 'V.', 'The history of free men is never really written by chance--but by choice--their choice.', 'It is a matter of national will, of political decision, of moral purpose.', 'If our will today be strong, our decision emphatic, and our purpose clear--I truly believe that these years before us may belong to our history as among the most fruitful and the most honorable that America has ever known.', 'My fellow citizens, no one man--certainly not I--nor any political party could ever truthfully pretend that his efforts--or its efforts--alone can bring all good things to pass.', 'But I dare speak a simple belief--and a simple prayer.', 'I would dare believe, first, that history may say that, during the years of my first Administration, the faith of our people--in the growth of peace and of justice--grew steadily stronger.', ""But beyond this, there is something deeper. Looking ahead, I would pray that if it be the people's will that I continue my present service--the years of my second Administration may prove that--thanks to the labor of all Americans--this great faith of theirs was justified."", 'Thank you very much.']",1
17,Dwight D. Eisenhower ,"October 16, 1956","['Mr. Chairman, Senator Thye, Congressman Judd, your soon-to-be Governor, Ancher Nelsen, and a brand new Congressman who should tower in some ways over everybody in Washington, George Mikan--my Fellow Americans:', 'First, let me thank you on behalf of both Mamie and myself for the heartwarming welcome you have given us. We are deeply touched.', ""Now, ever since I became the Army's Chief of Staff, about eleven years ago, I have been coming regularly to Minnesota and to Minneapolis. Every visit here has been a sort of home-coming, getting back among old and warm friends. And the cordiality of your welcome makes this the best home-coming of all."", 'I should tell you that, in a very real sense, I am here today-as President--because of you, the people of Minneapolis and of Minnesota.', 'Back in the spring of 1952, I was scrutinizing prayerfully my duties and responsibilities--trying to resolve my doubts as to whether there was any place or need for me in politics, and to settle in my mind and my conscience what I ought to do. At that time, the write-in vote in the Minnesota Primary moved me far along the road to a final decision. Since that day, I have always felt a special kinship and relationship with you of this city and State.', 'Now, one of my friends has done outstanding work in high office for you and for me and for America. There is no finer citizen than Ancher Nelsen, who served as the head of the Rural Electrification Administration in Washington in my Administration.', 'You know, a couple of weeks ago, I read in the paper that down at the Worthington Turkey Day, a national opposition candidate made an erroneous charge against Ancher. I found out later that that man had to publicly eat his words. I think anyone would have a hard time making a false charge stick against Ancher--and you will be prouder still of him and of your State when you elect him Governor.', 'Now, in the brief visit I am to have with you today, I want to talk for a few minutes about agriculture. This is especially appropriate in this State, where on the Republican side your Senior United States Senator, your next Governor, and your State Chairman, John Hartwell, are all honest-to-goodness farmers. And right here I want to add that I hope you good people of Minnesota will return all your Republican Congressmen, and increase their number.', 'What I have to say is in this spirit: I want full justice for all farmers, because they are inseparable from--and indispensable to-- a truly prospering America, and everything I do seeks to assure full justice and fairness for all the American people. I am equally dedicated to the needs and aspirations of labor, of business, of education, of the professions--not because they are specialized groups--nor voting blocs to be pitted against one another--but because they all have vital, functioning roles in the harmony of our free society.', ""In this spirit, I seek--and I shall continue to seek--to assure our farm families their full share of our nation's unparalleled prosperity today."", 'Now, in talking about agriculture, I realize that I am talking in a great City. But you here in this City, here in the heartland of American agriculture--each of you realizes that we cannot have lasting prosperity in our cities without the same prosperity on our farms.', ""In recent weeks you have heard some others talking about farming, in this State and in this City. From what I've read of some of their statements I am sure that if some of these men drove a tractor like they talk, they would have a mighty tough time driving a straight furrow!"", 'It is certainly not straight talk to say that our farmers would be better off to return to the programs that caused surpluses to pile up and prices to go down.', 'The record on this is clear.', 'From World War II until last year, rigid wartime price supports induced the farmer to grow more of certain crops than he could sell and choked off much of his foreign market. Huge surpluses built up. Prices went down.', 'Rigid supports did not cause high farm income. Wars--with their high demand--did that. When wars were ended--and even before--prices started down. And as I have remarked before, it really takes genius to drive prices down when you have got a war on. Yet they did go down in 1952 while the Korean War was in full swing.', 'So by the time this Administration took office--almost four years ago now--the whole farm economy was seriously threatened.', 'Recognizing this difficulty, and particularly that there is no such thing as a farm problem, rather a multitude of them, we began personal meetings in Washington with farm leaders. We got representatives of the Farm Bureau, the Farmers Union, and the Grange. We got people from the great Land Grant Colleges of the United States. We got practical dirt farmers, and we had conference after conference. We had them with the Cabinet officers, with your Congressmen, with whole farm families coming down. And out of this, we constructed a farm program.', 'We proposed legislation. Despite delays and opposition, we got sizable parts through. Consequently, this year is the first year since World War II that farm prices have started back up without the tragic help of war. And this, my friends, is the first full year in which the new farm program, worked out by this Administration in cooperation with the farming community, has been at work.', 'Now, contrast that with the eight long years--excepting the one Korean War year--when farm prices went down under the old laws.', 'Here, then, is the plain proof. The new laws work.', 'Nevertheless, some political orators--no doubt overly excited by the din of a campaign--actually have been saying that I am ""against"" the little farmer, that I consider the farmer expendable, that I think the family farm is obsolete. What kind of drivel is this?', 'The family farm is the cornerstone of American agriculture, just as the family is the cornerstone of our whole society. There is no one among us that needs to be told that if our family life is weakened, likewise our nation shall suffer. In the same way, if the farm family is not to be the center of our concern in this whole problem of agriculture, then we are indeed shooting wide of the mark.', 'This Administration has acted to help the family farm in the most concrete ways: Social Security for farm operators; the Federal gas tax refund; the Soil Bank; the most liberal Farm Credit Program in history; the biggest, most creative research program to find new products, new uses for old products, new markets for all products.', 'And just a word about another Administration effort of which I am very proud: the Rural Development Program. It is a bold, long-range program for lifting the lowest-income people in rural areas by improving their education, skills, credit facilities and earning opportunities. Here in Minnesota three counties-Itasca, Hubbard and Carlton--are among more than fifty pilot counties in the country where this Program is now advancing.', 'Now that this vital effort, recognizing the special needs of low-income farmers, is well underway, I am determined to bring into the government the best man I can find in this field to devote full time to speeding and perfecting the Program.

We think there can be no government in Washington better than the people that have sent it there."", 'Finally, my friends, I must speak a word of what is most in the minds and hearts of all of us.', 'We all know that all these concerns of our national life that I have been discussing have true and lasting value only in the light of our tireless quest of a just and lasting peace.', 'We have advanced a long way on the road toward that goal.', ""The peace we enjoy today is, of course, not all that we would wish--nor all that, with God's help, it will one day be. Centuries of mutual hatred among nations, of ancient prejudices and quarrels, cannot be erased in a few short years."", 'And yet we must ask ourselves: why the anguished cry of some politicians, these days, that we have made no gains whatsoever toward the peace we seek? The plain truth is that Americans know very well the difference between today--and the days of the Korean casualty lists. And Americans have not forgotten those other milestones--all around the world--on our road to peace: Austria, Trieste, West Germany, Guatemala, Panama, Caracas, Geneva.', 'All of these have meant some worthy effort to promote that understanding, that common reverence of the spirit of justice that will finally bring to the peoples of the earth a peace in which we can confidently trust.', ""But are these wailing politicians really trying to bring Americans to believe that our nation's voice is not urging--daily and powerfully. conciliation, mutual understanding and justice? We are doing exactly that in the Suez problem."", 'Can these politicians believe that Americans are blind to the strength and persistence of our efforts to dedicate the atom not to the destruction but to the constructive service of mankind?', 'My friends, the simple truth is this: All America is dedicated to peace--a just and lasting peace.

This longing is not subject to partisanship.', 'Yet in our labor toward the peace we seek, we must comprehend always its basic requirements, and face up to them manfully.', 'First: strength--spiritual, intellectual, economic and military strength.', 'Second: unity--our clear awareness that the road to peace is one that all nations must travel together, else none can do so.', ""Third: faith--a faith in the greatness of our purpose that inspires in all of us a readiness to work and to sacrifice, that this greatest of all mankind's hopes may one day be realized."", 'It is to this kind of effort--and in this kind of understanding-that your Administration is pledged.', 'Today, here in Minnesota, I renew this pledge of continued, determined labor, of the prayerful devotion of myself and all my associates to this greatest cause of all: peace for the world and America.', 'Thank you very much indeed.']",1

It has been an exciting experience--travelling across this nation of ours. There is nothing more exciting than America itself--what it consistently achieves, what it eternally stands for.', 'Yet, beyond this truth, I have been seeing everywhere the signs of a vigorous and dynamic people at work.', 'I have seen the smoky fury of our factories--rising to the skies, and proclaiming to the world that 66 million American workers are more prosperous and secure than ever in our history.', 'I have seen a farm economy strengthened--and farmers, at last, encouraged--by the knowledge that realistic farm programs are finally at work. They know, these farmers, that these programs are no longer the crude creations of political expediency. They know that the farmer himself is no longer to be insulted as a commodity for which our parties make competitive bids in the political market.', ""I have seen our cities and towns--where more homes have been built in these last three and one-half years than in any like period in the nation's history. In those same cities and towns, your government constantly presses forward its attack on slums and blighted neighborhoods."", ""And there are other great things that I have had no need to see--for I know them. I mean--the blasting and the scraping of the earth to open the great St. Lawrence Seaway, bringing the commerce of the world to the heartland of America. I mean also, conservation projects. Just day before yesterday, I pushed a button that started actual work on the Upper Colorado storage project, a mighty work that when completed will add incalculably to America's strength and prosperity. I mean--the roaring of Diesel engines and the pouring of concrete for thousands upon thousands of miles of roads--that are about to signal the beginning of the greatest highway program in all our history. And I mean--the rolling mills, the open hearths, the flaming furnaces-from Buffalo and Pittsburgh to Gary and Birmingham. Everywhere, men--carpenters, bricklayers, machinists and electricians, men at their ledgers and men at their lathes--all are at work, building an America that can be the pride of our fathers, the hope of our children, and the strength of free men everywhere."", 'Now this, my friends, is what we see.', 'And yet--and yet in these days of political frenzy--this is not necessarily what we hear. We hear, instead, the angry hum of a locust-swarm of partisan orators. They are singing a strange, sad song--about a feeble and fretful America. Only a few weeks ago, too, they wrote a dark and mournful document--the platform of the opposition. When that document was published, one of the great independent newspapers of this country summed it up thusly: one might have thought, the paper said, that the authors of that platform inhabited some land just lately swept by famine and pestilence.', 'When I hear such words--when I look at the facts--I wonder one thing. I wonder if the cry of the political opposition is not simply this: things in America are rapidly going from bad--to good.', 'No--all those grim prophecies of four years ago have not come true. This Administration has not taken ""it"" away. ""It""--the productive power of America--has never been the gift of any political party. ""It"" could not be ""taken away.""

You know, I seriously doubt that they have even been able to convince the prairie dogs."", 'No--this is not a sick America, but a healthy America--not a weak nation, but a strong one--not a fearful people, but a confident one.

This I know in my mind.', 'II.', 'My fellow citizens--even though we may smile at much of the partisan oratory of these days, even though we may doubt if much of it was ever worth uttering--yet some of it is worth examining. It is worth examining--not in a spirit of anger--but rather in a spirit of learning.', 'Now, let students of political science take a few notes.', 'First: We have had some new examples of an old device--the half-truth.', 'The opposition spokesmen loudly lament a rise of less than 3 percent in the cost of living over the past three and one-half years. But--they remember not to mention that this cost of living has soared 50 percent, almost, in the last 7 years of their Administration.', ""They express every American's concern for the plight of our low-income families. But--they are careful not to mention that today's prosperity has reduced the number of such families to an all-time low in America's history."", 'They sorrow--as any American does--for the trials of any fellow citizen who is unemployed. But--they are careful not to mention that unemployment--now--in September--the latest month on which we have any figures--in September of this year, unemployment had fallen to a rate lower than any peacetime September in their twenty years of political rule.', 'I think we may leave to the philosophers the question: Is half a truth better than none?', 'But I believe most Americans would ask: Why not tell the whole truth?', 'Second: We meet the device of the hit-and-run statement.', 'They gave us a stunning example of this when they charged the present Administration with loaning vast sums of money which was later used to build up the personal fortune of an exiled Latin American dictator, they said. They made only one mistake: they were peering into the barrel of their own gun when they pulled the trigger. For it was their Administration that made those loans.', 'Now, they have fled from that particular scene of this issue-in headlong silence.', 'They have run out of sight--taking flight, no doubt, far, far down the high, high road.', 'Third: We meet the political tactic of the big straddle.', 'They bravely denounce inflation in the cities--and they go to the countryside with their extravagant promises of the loose credit that makes for inflation.', 'They promise a stout national defense, or a bold role in world affairs--and they urge us to start planning to stop our military draft.', 'They promise lower taxes--bigger Government spending on virtually every front--and a nicely balanced budget--all constituting the biggest--and the boldest--three-in-one sale in recent American politics.', 'It is difficult to see how they can do these things all at once. Now, we have been called the exponents of a middle-of-the-road philosophy, and I admit it. And if these people want to pass us on the left or on the right, that is their political privilege, but how do they expect to pass us on both sides at once?', 'Now, the fourth, and finally: In this strangely confused course in government that we are taking, we see put to new use the old-fashioned double standard--otherwise known as the rubber yardstick. By this convenient device sense and nonsense become happily confused. Thus:', ""In 1952 the Republican Party's vigorous internal debate made the Party--we were told by these opponents--a two-headed monster. In 1956, they find us a one-headed monster. We are guilty of the crime of unity."", ""When Republican spokesmen candidly differ among themselves, our opponents say that we prove that our party lacks true leadership. But when opposition leaders aspiring to the highest office in the land denounce one another as unfit and unqualified for the Presidency--and that, my friends, in terms that we would never dream of using--why, then it's just good, clean, boyish fun. Then, when the former enemies finally embrace in public--they point to the scars they inflicted on one another, as if they were badges of qualification for public office."", 'In 1952, we were denounced as a probably military-minded, saber-rattling party of war. In 1956--having brought an honorable end to a war we inherited--we are again denounced--now they say we talk too much about peace.', 'All these things, my friends, I mention in no spirit of anger or outrage. They are simply oddities and curiosities--they are political fables that tell of a political wonderland. It is a land of the opposition\'s own confused making. And it was this wonderland that the opposition candidate himself was describing-perhaps more truly than he realized--with his recent remark that I am merely fighting ""straw men.""', 'III', 'Now, my friends, let us return to the world of reality. Possibly we can do it with a sort of sigh of relief. Here we can survey the scene much more quickly--and more constructively.', 'I speak now of facts--rare commodities on the political market today.', 'And I offer you ten clear facts.', '(1) Labor today is the biggest--and the best organized-working force in American history; and its share of our national income--70 cents out of every dollar--is the highest it has been in twenty years. Labor is receiving its highest hourly and weekly wage in all our experience.', '(2) Production has surged well beyond the history-making mark of 400 billion dollars a year; and this production-pace will soon be providing 70 million jobs for Americans.', ""(3) Farm prices this year--the first full year in which this Administration's programs have operated--have begun to rise without the cruel assistance of wartime demands--for the first time--and this is the first time this has happened since World War II."", '(4) Conservation, wise use and development of our natural resources, have been put on a sound, long-term partnership basis--enlisting full state, local and private effort alongside massive Federal Government effort.', '(5) The menace of inflation has been successfully met for the first time in a generation--as we have achieved, these last three and a half years, the most stable living costs over a like period in twenty years. These remarkably stable living costs, let me explain, are vital--not to great banks or massive corporations--but to all citizens--especially our older people--depending upon fixed income, life insurance, pensions or social security payments.', '(6) We have brought to your government--both to its fiscal policies and to its whole operation--qualities long absent and badly needed--consistency and integrity.', '(7) We have helped to advance the cause of civil rights with human understanding, with reason and with consideration. We have acted on the sound principle of talking less and doing more. This Administration has erased all vestiges of segregation in all areas clearly within the authority of the Federal government-and this for the first time in our history.', '(8) Social security has been extended in coverage--and its benefits increased--to give to tens of millions of citizens the greatest promise and protection they have ever known.', '(9) Our national defense today rests upon the strongest peacetime force--and the strongest deterrent power--that we have ever possessed. Let us not forget, my friends, we keep defense forces to keep the peace. The only way to win the next world war is to prevent it. This is the principle that guides that great corps of devoted and dedicated military leaders that we have in Washington, as well as every single individual civilian official that has to do with this great subject.', '(10) Now we have proven that our quest for peace with justice does not require repetitions of the Korean tragedy to deter further Soviet military aggression. In this quest--our continuing, persistent and most difficult quest--we have achieved one thing perhaps more important than the solution of many local crises. And it is this: we have made known, in ways understood by men everywhere in the world, America\'s uncompromising devotion to the cause of peace. We have done this at a series of world conferences--rising to the climax of the Summit at Geneva. And we have done this with our repeated and specific proposals for world disarmament--our ""open skies"" offer of mutual inspection of Soviet and American defenses--and with our program of atoms for peace.', ""From the very beginning of this Administration, my friends, we have urged all the powers to devote this new nuclear science to man's constructive purposes and not to his destruction. We have asked only that we have safeguards that we can trust as well as others can trust, so that this path of peace toward universal disarmament can be traveled by all. We want to turn nuclear science to the production of power, to assist the doctors in their medical research, to agriculture, to industry, and so on. We simply refuse to do it all alone. Until others do it with us, we are going to stay strong."", 'There is one old truth I should like to repeat here: it has often been said and said truthfully, that the world must cooperate or in the long run it will perish. That I believe. But I want to bring this point out, my friends: weakness cannot cooperate with anything. All that weakness can do is beg. Strength can cooperate. That is what we intend to do. We will hold out the hand of friendship to every single nation and people in the world--anyone that will grasp it honestly we will be glad to take them within the circle of our friends.', 'Now, all these things we have done to serve one steadfast purpose: to lead mankind to dedicate its skills and its strength--no longer to the demands of war--but, at last, to the arts and needs of peace.', 'IV.', 'I have stated the record of facts.', 'I do not believe it needs any added ornament of oratory or exhortation.', 'I commend it to your scrutiny.', 'I am confident of your judgment.', 'Thank you, my friends.']",1

Oregon will go right once again."", ""My friends, there are a dozen things I could talk to you about today. As a matter of fact, I have been poring for the last few days over manuscripts of what I am going to say tonight. But, as of now, I think I will just wander around a little bit and tell you a few things that seem important to me. It won't be a speech, but maybe it will give you an idea here and there that will help you in your work as you get Oregon's voters to the polls on November 6th."", ""First of all, regarding public office, I have had a good many years' experience in selecting people for positions in government--for many years in the military, and since then in civil office. As you do that, you get to pondering in your mind, what is the first thing you want? ' Men and women have different qualifications. Some are brilliant, some are plodders--some are very personable. What is the first quality you look for? I would say, possibly, in military life and civil life it is not exactly the same. But in this political business, my friends, I commend to you one quality: honesty. Just plain, ordinary honesty. Plain, ordinary integrity--intellectual honesty--honesty with the people--honesty in pursuing your pledged word just as hard as you know how to do it."", 'I remember, many years ago, Carter Glass in his prime was asked to Yale University where he received an honorary degree, and in giving him this very flattering commendation, they read off this long commendation, and through it the word ""honesty"" was repeated several times. And he got up and said, ""I rather despair of the Republic if we are getting to the place where you have to reward a man for being honest.""', ""Now, I don't think honesty is so rare that you have to pin a big medal on him in any walk of life, but I do insist over and over again: put someone in public office upon whose word you can depend."", 'I therefore bring this name to you in that connection: Douglas McKay.', 'Of course, I have not known him nearly as long as many of you in this audience, but I saw him under these special conditions, where on a meeting of the minds on a difficult subject, no matter what it was, each one bringing in his opinion, his conviction, on what should be done--and I shall always testify to this--to Douglas McKay, he never pulled his punches on what he believed. What he believed to be right, that was what was done as far as his recommendations were concerned.', 'Now, I don\'t know some of your other candidates for office in this State as well as I do Douglas McKay, but I can say this: If they are running on the same team with him, I am about ready to write my name under there and say ""I think he\'ll do. He\'s a good one.""', 'So then, if we have that as the first quality--we want honesty-we want, then, someone who represents for us--people that send him there--the kind of thinking with respect to government that is at the bottom of our political philosophy.', 'In general, I think you could define the Republican Party in its management of the domestic affairs of our country, so far as government affects them, along this line:', 'We believe, first, in fiscal integrity. Consequently we believe in the sound dollar, the dollar that when you come around to start living on your pension or social security will be worth every cent that you are now putting into it. That is the kind of dollar we want.', 'If we are going to do that, we have to keep income and outgo in the government level; and in order, therefore, to avoid heavily taxing the people, we must keep governmental expenditures as low as it is possible for us to do and to carry on the functions expected of the government. That is the second.', 'And the third is this; and very important: Keep government as close to the governed as it is humanly possible to do.', ""By and large, our opponents believe the opposite of these things. They believe in heavier government expenditures; and if it brings about deficits, that is of no moment to them because they believe in what they call the loose credit of the easy dollar. All very well, as long as it doesn't bring about inflation. But inflation is the robber that takes the money out of your pocket, and particularly out of your pensions, your insurance policies and all long-term investments. So we won't have that. And they believe in that, or at least they practice that."", 'They believe in centralized government. They say, ""We are very wise in Washington, we know how to run this country. Now, you just pay your taxes and do as we say, and everything will be nice.""', 'We say: the power of the United States--the strength of America--is developed only when government releases the illimitable qualifications, capacities and initiative of every individual citizen, and merely guides them in the direction where the common good will be served.', 'All of us want peace. There is no American that I know of who would really like to see any kind of war, big or little.', ""In foreign affairs the problem of decision resolves itself into this: Do we pursue our objectives from a position of strength, dealing with others on a perfectly fair, equitable basis, always holding out the hand of friendship but saying, if you don't want to be friends, we will be the strongest nation in the world."", 'Now in this kind of thing, there is nothing truculent, there is nothing antagonistic, we simply speak from bitter experience. Thrice in our lifetime--at least in my lifetime--we have seen our country in war.', 'Why? Because we were too weak for the circumstances of the time. We shall not be that again. We must not be that again.', 'So we continue to pursue peace through every honorable avenue open to us through conference, whether it be on the ordinary diplomatic level or at the summit at Geneva, or among the Presidents in Panama.', 'However it is done, we pursue peace with honor and with justice for all. One thing we know: all nations must travel the road of peace, or none can do so. This means peace must be secured by agreement--and agreements and covenants mean we are not afraid to let you look at us, and you are not afraid to let us look at you. That is all we ask. We reject any thought that we will say--and know we are going to keep our word--we will disarm in any respect and it may be you will do so some day. We will do it in unison.', 'So I think, my friends, when you come to consider your choices in the foreign field, you have to take this criteria probably: hard sense and experience versus pie in the sky promises and wishful thinking. That is the decision there.', ""Now I had a lot of things--as I was riding down in the plane-I was going to say to this group, and I haven't said a single one of them yet. As I told you, I left my ideas and everything else I had along that road coming in. It was a joyous road."", 'But I am going to tell you one story which I have told several times--possibly you have heard it; but it does illustrate the kind of question that a good Republican worker has to be able to answer, or to give an answer to, and very quickly. This is just one of them.', 'A good Republican worker was walking down the street and he met a man; and he stopped him and said, ""My friend, I would like to talk a little politics to you."" And he said, ""How are you going to vote?""', '""Well,"" he says, ""I am going to vote for Stevenson, of course.""', 'Well, that set our Republican friend back on his heels a little bit, but he recovered enough to say, ""Would you give me your reasons?""', '""Why,"" he says, ""the best in the world.

For I know--as I believe all Americans know--that, without strength in this world of today, the road to surrender is paved with good intentions."", 'I have not pretended--nor will I ever--that the way to serve the strength of America--the unity of America--is to appeal to faction and division. For I have always believed that, in the American design, each group may have particular problems, but none has particular privileges; each has special needs, but none has special rights.', 'I have not promised--nor will I ever--that the way to make the American economy strong is--simultaneously--to lower Federal taxes sharply, to increase Federal spending lavishly, and so to create an economic atmosphere in which inflation again can run riot.', ""Such a formula, my friends, sounds like the ambitious politician's miracle model budget--bigger on the inside, smaller on the outside."", ""Now these few instances, my fellow citizens, remind us of one thing true: The strength of America's political life depends--not upon the size of political promises--but the integrity of political purposes."", 'II.', 'Let us now see how some of our purposes have--in these last four years--been expressed in deeds.', 'How have we sought to strengthen the fabric of American society?', 'Here are a few of the ways:', ""(1) It took just 81 days after I took the oath of Office to create the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare-the first new department created in 40 years. As a result, for the first time in our history, critical problems of our people's welfare, their education and their health, are met on the same Cabinet level--with the same care--as the greatest issues of world affairs."", '(2) We have extended the coverage of Social Security--and increased its benefits--to give tens of millions of citizens the greatest protection they have ever known.', '(3) Housing: There have been more new homes built since January 1953 than in any comparable previous period in our history. Today three of every five families in our towns and cities own their own homes--a record without precedent. This year I called for--and Congress enacted--special assistance for housing for older persons.', 'Just today I authorized the use of 20 million dollars by the Housing agents of the government for purchase of mortgages under this special program for the benefit of our older people.', 'Now, I know, of course, that the recent decline in homebuilding has hurt the vital lumbering and forest products industries so important to this area. The Administration has already taken steps to increase the flow of credit to homebuyers and homebuilders. And we will take such further steps within our power as are necessary.', '(4) In Public Health: We have given Federal assistance for the building of research laboratories, for special medical centers, for developing ways to give more effective care to patients in our mental institutions--all these things for the first time in our history. I am proud of this accomplishment.', ""(5) In Education: We have shown our awareness that here-the very strength of America's future is at stake. To meet our school problems, I called a national assembly of educators and laymen--the first time that such an action has been taken. And it was this expert counsel of this great body of educators and laymen that guided our five-year school-building program submitted to the last Congress."", 'What matters now is not the argument, in terms of partisan politics, as to why Congress failed to enact this needed legislation. What does matter to every American citizen is this fact: I shall call upon the next Congress to enact a school program to make up for the lost year--by doing the job of school-building, not in five years but in four.', 'In all these fields, then--education, public health, housing, social security--I can say to you today: to meet the challenges that remain, there is such strength in American society as there has never been before.', 'III.', ""Our strength assumes one form of special meaning to you people in our great Northwest. For--even as the bounty of our soils and forests, rivers and mines, is one of America's greatest blessings from a generous Providence--this part of America has been singularly favored."", 'This current political season could have been a time when problems concerning our natural resources might have been accurately stated and seriously debated. We have--instead--been subjected by the political opposition to the senseless, drumbeat charge of--""giveaway."" I need say only this: such a frivolous charge is only a feeble echo of the political cry heard four years ago--the cry that we would ""give away"" or ""take away"" the whole prosperity of the whole American people.', ""Why do you suppose we don't hear that cry any more? Because in four years America is happier--wealthier--with its prosperity more widely shared than ever before."", 'So now I offer you a few, very significant facts.', 'First--in Conservation and Reclamation. We have sponsored the Pilot Watershed Act, the Soil Bank, the Great Plains Program--while carrying forward one of the largest programs ever undertaken by the Bureau of Reclamation. In flood control, navigation, and river and harbor projects, we have in these last two years been advancing work on more than 300 undertakings--85 of them entirely new.', 'If that is ""giveaway,"" why not let them wail?', 'Second--in National Parks and Wild Life. Having inherited a declining system of national parks, we have added more than 400,000 acres to our park systems: and we are this year beginning a bold new 10-year program--Mission 66, it is called, as Doug McKay has no doubt told you before often--to expand and improve this system still further. In guarding our wild life-whereas the previous Administration had taken some 400,000 acres out of the wild life areas--we have added 80,000 to them.', 'Might I say, if that is ""giveaway,"" let them wail some more!', ""And third--our Water Resources. Just three days ago from Washington, D.C., I touched off blasts starting work on the great Upper Colorado Project. Covering five States, this is the second largest project of its kind in our history--and a monumental testimony to your government's awareness of Federal responsibility."", 'When I touched off the blast for those dams at Glen Canyon and Flaming Gorge the other day, I recalled about four years ago, an opposition spokesman told his listeners, at the Hungry Horse Dam in Montana, to take a good look because they would never see another one built if the Republicans came in.', 'My friends, he was not the first politician to pole-vault into a ditch.', 'Now, my friends, with like awareness, we have extended the scope of the Water Facilities Act from 17 to all 48 States, and-in sponsoring the so-called ""Small Projects Act""--we have taken one of the greatest forward steps in the history of reclamation in our country.', ""All these actions to strengthen our natural resources reflect our partnership policy--joining Federal, State, local and private effort in our great common endeavor. Here we have--very deliberately--reversed those practices of the 1930's and the 1940's that meant tight centralization of control in Washington--a virtual Federal monopoly of construction of water and power projects."", 'What wrongs are there in such a practical Federal monopoly:', 'It removes initiative and decision far from the people whose own knowledge and self-reliance are the soundest guides to action. It pits region against region in a struggle for favor in Washington. And it inevitably dooms many areas to delay and disappointment, as they are forced to wait while others receive Federal favor.', 'Our partnership policy is designed to meet great and growing needs. Power requirements for the next ten years will cost some 40 billion dollars. There is not--and there will not be--that much Federal money allotted to be distributed in such a period.', 'Only the partnership program can do the job that must be done-quickly and efficiently.', 'Now the proofs of this are already here before us. In this Pacific Northwest--there are today under actual construction projects whose power-generating capacity total more than 4 million kilowatts. More than 1 and ½ million kilowatts of this capacity is being built entirely by Federal agencies. And the total capacity is the equivalent of eight Bonneville dams.', 'Finally, my fellow citizens, we meet this momentous fact: the United States today leads the world in the harnessing of our new power--our atomic power--for peacetime use. We have built more atomic reactors--of all types and sizes--than all the rest of the world combined. The first full scale atomic plant for the production of power exclusively for civilian use--the first anywhere in the world--will be in operation next year. More than this, in the years immediately ahead--at least 17 more such plants will be completed.', 'Thus on every front--from conservation of our ancestral resources, to development of our most modern resources--the same fact is clear: we are building a stronger and stronger America-- to sustain the prosperity we enjoy--and, ultimately, to win the peace we seek.', 'Now I want to speak a final word about this peace.', ""I spoke my conviction in my first address of this campaign: This peace embraces all things in our work and in our lives. It does not mean merely stilling of the guns. It means all of those things for which men's hearts long. It means to work in confidence day by day, that you do not live under a threat--a cloud-of war. You can trust your neighbor--your neighboring nation--as you do your neighbor across the backyard fence."", 'The kind of peace we seek is one that must be reached through this great strength of America--the spiritual, intellectual, military and economic strength.', 'We use it, not to threaten, not to be truculent, not to be overriding or overbearing. But you say to our neighbor, whether it be now friend or potential enemy: Go along for the peace of mankind, and you will find us your partner.', ""Now, my friends, such a peace we can possess only as the world does. And the world's hope, in turn, depends upon the strength of our national life, the force of our leadership, the integrity of our government, the daily well-being of our people, and the vigor of our economy, the might of our resources."", 'All of this strength, I repeat, bundled in together is the force that stands behind the effort toward peace today.', 'So there remain two great questions.', 'How do we propose to use this strength to serve the peace we seek?', 'The answer is--in these clear ways: resolutely to defend ourselves--wisely to warn our enemies--constantly to give hope to the enslaved--prudently to help guard freedom everywhere, and courageously to be worthy of the high commission that history has conferred upon us.', 'And now I think it would profit us to pause and say: where do we find the ultimate source of this strength?', 'As we cherish and guard the resources of our people and of nature itself--even as we strengthen the security of our aged and the education of our children--even as we guard jealously and develop tirelessly the riches in our earth--yet we know that the ultimate source of our strength lies beyond, far beyond all these things.', 'A century ago a wise philosopher--a Frenchman--came to this land seeking the answer to this question--wherein lies the greatness and the genius of America ?', 'I read to you his answer on the eve of our national election-four years ago when I was in Boston. Tonight--here in Portland, as another moment of great national decision nears--I wish to read it to you again.', 'These are his words:', '""I sought for the greatness and genius of America in her commodious harbors and her ample rivers--and it was not there . . . I sought for the greatness and genius of America in her fertile fields and boundless forests--and it was not there . . . I sought for the greatness and genius of America in her democratic congress and her matchless constitution--and it is not there.', '""Not until I went into the churches of America and heard her pulpits flame with righteousness--did I understand the secret of her genius and power.', '""America is great because America is good--and if America ever ceases to be good--America will cease to be great.""', 'My fellow citizens, this observation I have always remembered.', 'This is the truth by which America must ever live--and if she does so, she will grow ever stronger.', 'Thank you very much, my friends.']",1
22,Dwight D. Eisenhower ,"October 19, 1956","['Mr. Chairman, Governor Knight, Senator Kuchel, and my fellow Citizens:', 'This is a political meeting, and I think it is not out of place even for an outsider from your great State, in expressing certain hopes and aspirations about the coming election within your State. I hope, for example, that you will return the entire Republican delegation to the Congress--and add to its number. And I have the earnest hope that Senator Kuchel will come back to the United States Senate.', 'And I should like to say a special word about my great friend and running mate, Dick Nixon.', 'There have been many fatuous and foolish and futile attempts to belittle the character of this great American. He is a man who has served his country in war and peace with dedication and with honesty. He is efficient and devoted to his duty. He has performed those duties both here and abroad in exemplary fashion.', 'I give as my last hope the idea that you--you people who know him best, as I know him well officially--will rally around to see that these futile attempts are scotched just as they should be.', 'Now, my friends, this is my last stop on this wonderful West Coast, on a journey that, like so many I have made, has carried me across our land. It has been an exciting and an assuring journey. I have seen--on the face of the land and on the faces of the people--a shining thing. It is--in two words--confidence and happiness.', 'Neither I--nor the hundreds of thousands I have seen--have been the least dismayed by any lingering echoes of a lot of recent, clamorous partisan oratory. And certainly no one any longer is frightened by that dolorous chant of four years ago, ""Don\'t let them take it away."" I hope my friends in Los Angeles may excuse my describing this oratory in one word, a word to which a few of you may be sensitive. This word is--""smog.""', 'Tonight, may I begin by dispelling some of this political smog obscuring and confusing important matters before our nation.', 'Over-ambitious politicians have made some curious statements about your government. They have charged that it is suffering from a ""contagion of corruption.""', 'Now, permit me two observations.', 'First: I offer a simple suggestion to any leader of the opposition. I suggest that--if I were anxious to win the confidence of the American people and remembering the Washington mess of only four years ago--there is one word that is the last that I would take from out the whole dictionary to use in a political argument--and that word is ""corruption."" When this word is uttered in any political hall of the opposition, it echoes with a most curious ring. I know why, for I recall an old but grim proverb. It comes from the greatest Spanish novel ever written. And it warns: ""Never mention rope--in the house of one who has been hanged.""', 'And now, may I add one very sober statement. I scorn this preposterous accusation--I condemn it as false--because it is a baseless insult to the many men and women associated with me in public service, whom I know and trust. They are men and women who--above and beyond all partisan differences--command the respect of the leadership of both parties of the Congress, and of the entire American people. I say nothing of myself. am glad to await--with confidence--your judgment upon such charges next November sixth.', 'Next: in speaking about our free society, these orators with wild abandon have charged that your government has no care at all for the citizen whom they so patronizingly call the ""little man.""', 'My fellow citizens, what kind of twisted talk is this? As I have asked before, what man has earned any right to speak of his neighbor as ""the little man""?', 'We--a free people, cherishing equality for all--have never known, nor will we ever accept, any division of our nation into ""little men"" and ""big men."" We do not judge our neighbor, or condemn him, by measuring the frontage of his property, the width of his television screen, or the wheel base of his car. We believe--and we shall go on believing--that man was not created to bear such labels as ""big"" or ""little.""', 'I pledged to you in 1952 that, as President of all the people, my concern would be for all the people.', 'When we examine seriously how all our citizens have prospered these last years, the facts are clear--the facts are historic. The share of labor in our national income stands at its highest in 20 years. The number of jobs in our economy stands at an all-time high. The average hourly and weekly earnings of our factory workers stand at an all-time high. The number of small businesses today active in our economy stands at an all-time high. And the number of so-called low-income families in our nation-this stands at an all-time low.', 'Beside this record of remarkable facts there stands an equally remarkable record of governmental action. The problems of the low-income farmer--of our aged--of any unemployed--of those suffering sickness or disability--all these problems have been attacked with the most vigorous and extensive programs in our whole history.', ""But these politicians achieve new heights either of comedy or of bewilderment when they speak about the shaping--the financing--of America's future."", 'They promise lower Federal taxes for every citizen, greater Federal spending on virtually every front, and a beautifully balanced Federal budget. I have called this phenomenon what it is: the biggest and most flamboyant three-for-one sale in recent American politics.', 'Perhaps we should not be too astonished by the politicians who are offering this extraordinary sale. Such sales are the common practice of businesses that expect very soon to go entirely out of business. And, after all, time runs out for these particular men-on November sixth.', 'II', 'There is really only one reason why I think it is worth trying to penetrate a little of this political smog this season. It does enable us, finally, to see some of the true differences and conflicts between their kind of leadership and ours.', 'We differ sharply--to begin with--in our definition of leadership itself. They, I believe, tend to confuse the thumping of a tub with the voice of the future. And--at their most eloquent-they offer phrases, or promises, that please the ear--but disappoint the intelligence.', ""We believe that leadership is truly tested not by words but by deeds. And we are sure that this kind of leadership calls for a certain balance of qualifications. Boldness alone is not enough-for this is no time in the world's history for action without reflection. Unrealistic theorizing is not enough--for this is surely no time for leaders of elaborate indecision."", 'Now--these two kinds of leadership--differ even on a matter of the evidence of our own senses--the kind of America that we see before us today. They profess to see an America divided by factions, feeble in purpose, faltering in strength. We see not a sick America, but a healthy America--a nation of strong will and clear purpose--not a fearful people, but a confident people.', 'These sweeping differences between us are the sum of clear conflicts between us on most critical matters of principle and policy.', 'Now, let me be specific.', '(1) They are fearful and hesitant about the capacity of our free economy to provide jobs for all. This fear impels them to rely essentially upon Government action to turn the wheels and to lift the levers of our productive power. And so they urge lavish government spending that can only lead to these things: new deficits, new inflation--renewed wage and price controls to try to cope with that inflation--all of which can result only in increasing centralization of federal power.', ""Now, we believe quite differently. We have faith in the ability of free Americans to provide jobs for one another. We have faith in the imagination and ingenuity that have advanced the economic frontier of America far beyond the dreams of any other society man has ever known. And we believe that today a people's prosperity proves that we are right."", '(2) They, in spite of their protestations, must have little faith in labor--for they seem to put little trust in the free processes of collective bargaining.', 'We have the confidence that they lack. Trusting the processes of collective bargaining, we have seen organized labor, these past three and one-half years, win the best contracts--the greatest security for workers--in the history of American labor. We have seen the loss of time--as well as of wages--due to strikes fall sharply, and our whole people has gained from this greater industrial peace. There has been no instance, in this Administration, of trying to take over the steel mills.', '(3) They show little practical concern for guarding the stability of the dollar. Their record, their platform, even their oratory--all prove this.', 'We regard a stabilized dollar and stabilized living costs as vital to both prosperity and justice in our society. Our own history shows that those who most severely suffer from inflation are not great banks or colossal corporations--but all our citizens, especially our older people, who depend upon fixed income, life insurance, pensions or Social Security payments.', '(4) They believe, apparently, that the cause of civil rights can be advanced by a formula of much oratory and little performance. We have talked less--but we have acted with patience, human understanding, and with concern for the equal standing of all before the law. We have erased segregation in those areas of national life to which Federal authority clearly extends. So doing in this, my friends, we have neither sought nor claimed partisan credit, and all such actions are nothing more--nothing less than the rendering of justice. And we have always been aware of this great truth: the final battle against intolerance is to be fought-not in the chambers of any legislature--but in the hearts of men.', '(5) And finally: they tell us that peace can be guarded--and our nation secured--by a strange new formula. It is this: simultaneously to stop our military draft and to abandon testing of our most advanced military weapons.', 'Here perhaps, I may be permitted to speak in the first person singular.', 'I do not believe that any political campaign justifies the declaration of a moratorium on ordinary common sense.', 'I, both as your President and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States of America, cannot and will not tell you that our quest of peace will be cheap and easy. It may be costly--in time, in effort, in expense, and in sacrifice. And any nation unwilling to meet such demands cannot--and will not--lead the free world down the path of peace.', 'My fellow citizens, we might afford to be tolerant--in an amused sort of way--of the current effort to sell on the domestic front senseless economic panaceas in a political bargain-basement. We cannot be very tolerant of the suggestion that the peace of the world can be bought on the same terms and at the same counter. And the man who today dismisses our military draft as ""an incredible waste"" is a man who, while I do not question his sincerity, is speaking from incredible folly, or incredible ignorance of war and the causes of war.', 'My friends, the strength of America, in this world of 1956, means much more than the pride or the power of one nation. It is the hope--and the need--of free men in all the world.', ""Now you realize, when I talk of the strength of America, I don't talk merely of the gigantic planes, the tanks, the weapons, the guided missile, the regiments--that is only part of the strength of America. The strength of America is spiritual, intellectual, economic, and the military is merely a symbol of that strength--a part of that strength."", 'We talk from stout hearts, from keen analysis of all the factors involved, with readiness to give the other fellow credit for being honest, whenever he is ready to prove his honesty.', 'We cannot risk the safety of our beloved country on the words of those who have--time and time and time again--broken their solemn pledged word to the whole civilized world.', 'I say to you that no government seeks the peace of the world-the concord of all nations--the friendship of all peoples--more fervently, more steadfastly, than the present government of the United States.', 'And I say this to you no less solemnly: until the communists are ready to agree to mutual inspection, bringing the necessary assurance to both sides--to each side--that the other is operating in good faith, we shall seek these goals by staying strong and growing stronger. For a weak nation, my friends, cannot bring hope to its friends. It can only beg mercy from its potential enemies.', 'But this type of strength, as I have said, is but a symbol and a tool of the real strength of America, which is the determination in our hearts that this land of ours and the institutions that have been passed down to us from our fathers, shall be kept safe and secure from any assault from wherever it may come.', 'III.', ""Now, in these times, it is natural enough for me--in my position-to look back to the times, the problems, and the words of our nation's first Republican President."", 'He asked himself, as you may remember, a question that we, a century later, often ask ourselves: ""What constitutes the bulwark of our own liberty and our independence?""', ""And this was Lincoln's memorable answer:"", '""It is not our frowning battlements, our bristling seacoasts. Our reliance is the love of liberty which God has planted in us. Our defense is in the spirit which prizes liberty as the heritage of all men, in all lands, everywhere.""', 'Let us not--with all our talk of super bombs, fire power, air power, intercontinental missiles--let us never forget this truth.', 'It is this truth that binds us all, firmly and forever, in a common cause--the man who grows rice in Burma--or wheat in Iowa; the man who mines coal in the Ruhr--or in West Virginia; the fisherman off the Bay of Naples--or off the shores of California.', 'And this is the truth which makes a single, and meaningful sacrifice of those lives which have been given in battle by the French soldier at Verdun, the British Tommy at Dunkirk, the GI in Korea.', 'Living by this truth--and faithful to all that it may demand of us--we can pray--and dare believe--that the hope of free men, for a world of justice and of law, may one day proudly prevail.', 'Thank you very much, my friends.']",1
23,Dwight D. Eisenhower ,"October 20, 1956","['Governor Johnson, Mr. Mayor, Governor Thornton, other distinguished guests, My Friends:', 'This is by way of a homecoming for Mamie and me. It is not, so far as I am concerned, a political meeting. But I have been on a political trip and so it would be a little out of character if I had not a word to say about the political situation.', 'The first thing I must say is this: Both Mrs. Eisenhower and I are deeply honored that the Governor should come out to meet us this morning, and I do hope he understands it when I say that he, retiring voluntarily--I want to see him succeeded by Don Brotzman.', ""Of course, I am very hopeful, and here I couldn't speak with more feeling, that you will be able to send Dan Thornton to the Senate to help us out."", 'Your Republican delegation in the House, I would like to see all of them come back, and I want to see you add to it. The more the better.', ""Now, in a way, it's rather a sad thing for Mamie and me to come back here for only a half-hour stay. This is the place that we have so often spent our leaves through our married life, and in late years have even established headquarters in the little White House, which this summer we couldn't do."", 'This has been a matter of great regret, and had we our own way, we should now stay a week instead of a half-hour. We would like to mingle with old friends, to enjoy your matchless recreation facilities, and to experience again a spell of this wonderful weather which Thornton assures me today is only average.', 'But, my friends, events rush on us, and there is no time to stay a week today. Things are happening in the world and there is a campaign in progress to decide how this country shall be run the next four years.', ""So the problem is to go back and to work for what I like to call a people's prosperity, and for the great cause of peace."", 'The strength of our country must always be our first concern-its spiritual, intellectual, economic, and its military strength. Above all things, it is the concern of each of us living here in the heartland of the United States or its borders, in official life or on a farm--our first concern must be that our country is secure.', 'But we must remember that that strength is not merely military, it is a many-sided thing, and part of it is the great industrial, productive, economic strength of this great country--a great prosperity widely shared. That has come about and has come on an ascending scale in these last three and a half years, and is one of the things of which we can well be proud, one of the things that we must keep moving in the same direction.', ""Now, in the work for peace, again, each of us has a job to do, to make certain that our nation stays strong, that we live in the faith of our fathers, that peace can finally be achieved for the world, that we can do our part in right thinking, in working at our daily jobs to convince others in the world that we want none of their property, we don't want to dominate them, we merely want the opportunity for all men who love freedom to have it, to hold it, and to enjoy it."", 'This is our task, not only for those who are in the Congress and in the State gubernatorial chairs and in the legislatures. All of us--America--must stand together, stand strong and be of one mind if we are, from our position of strength, going to lead really on the road of peace.', 'One thing on this last trip which is just now ending for me has impressed me mightily. We have been up through the northern country and in Minnesota and into the Northwest and into Portland and Los Angeles and back here; and I am convinced of one thing: America is more prosperous, America is happier, than it was four years ago.', ""There are those who tell us that we have a false prosperity, that people are fearful. I don't find it. It is true that there are still individuals, there are pockets where prosperity has not reached the heights that it has in the general level, and these must be continuing problems of government and, indeed, of all of us. But over the nation, the prosperity we are sharing today is at a new height, a new level, even for the United States. And out of the confidence that we are progressing slowly, even if tortuously, toward a peace, we see a glow of happiness on people's faces. They are believing something. They are holding a faith."", 'And I say to you, that kind of faith, and that kind of belief, is the first essential to pushing onward toward peace.', 'The problems that remain in the world are, of course, staggering. We have only to read our daily newspapers and read the words on Suez where differing opinions between friends of ours bring about a critical situation and require the constant and earnest attention of all statesmen in order that we may be certain of a peaceful solution.', 'We read about Poland in our papers, we read about these captive peoples that are still keeping alive the burning desire to live in freedom, a freedom that we have come to take almost for granted, but which they have found is the most difficult thing to sustain in the world. Our hearts go out to them, that they at last may have that opportunity to live under governments of their own choosing.', 'But I say again to you, no matter how difficult these problems, no matter how frequently they arise, if we do keep our own country strong in all of the ways of which I have spoken, if we keep strong our confidence, and above all our faith in ourselves, our country and our God, we will win through.', 'Thank you very much, my friends.']",1

My friends, I know that some people have tried to impugn his loyalty. Some have called him a wild-eyed radical, and others lately, I see, have said he was a stick-in-the-mud reactionary.', 'I wonder if I could give you a few words of what I feel about Jack Javits. I have known him for some years. I have served with him in Washington. I have found him a man dedicated to his country, devoted to his duty, and wrapped up in his public service. So I would hope that throughout the length and breadth of this great State, from one corner to all the others, that on November 6th, every friend of his--every friend of mine--everybody who believes as he does, in good, clean government, will turn out and give him such a blazing majority that he will go to Washington inspired by your action, uplifted in spirit, to do a job for you--for the country--and for peace.', 'And may I remark, with your permission, that if I were privileged tonight to speak also in your sister State of Connecticut, as I am privileged to speak here, I would speak of Senator Bush in exactly the same words.', 'Now first of all, I feel great, largely because of the way you have greeted me. But tonight I am reminded, my friends, of the time when last we met here in the Garden four years ago.', 'It is a happy memory--of friendships born and action pledged. It is something more: it is a wise and necessary remembrance. For it inspires us to measure the distance we have come from that day--to this.', 'Now these, I believe, have been four years of memorable meaning.', 'Four years ago, we wandered wearily in the darkness of a drifting war. And we tensely awaited--wherever it next might strike--the sharp and sudden thrust of some new Communist military attack.', 'We watched--within our nation--the dreary decline of political morality--and we wondered for how long a government could effectively lead the free world when it no longer commanded the pride of its own people.', 'We anxiously marked--in our economy--the rising menace of inflation.', 'And we were dismayed that--in our society--the advance of civil rights, for all sections, in all areas of our country, could remain almost stalled on dead-center--while political orators spent their energy promising so much and doing so little.', 'And so tonight, my friends, comes the testing question: how much have we done to build an America of greater justice and dignity--in a world of greater hope for peace?', 'We have made some historic strides forward.', 'For example, we suffer--this night--no fearful suspense, awaiting news from any foreign battlefield calling our sons to danger and to death.', 'We await--this night--no chilling word of some new assault upon a free nation. We hear, instead, from the peoples of Eastern Europe, the solemn word--the solemn proof--that men who have once known the blessings of freedom will lay down their lives in its name. The people of Poland and of Hungary--indeed, of all Eastern Europe--they are men and women whom America has never forgotten--nor ever will.', 'We have witnessed--here at home--the restoration to our government of integrity and dignity.', 'We have welcomed--in our economy--an effective attack on inflation.', 'And we have discovered--in our society--the true way to advance the cause of civil fights: less oratory, and more action-never, may I say, my friends, on a partisan basis to claim political credit for a simple matter of American justice.', 'These, then, are a few of the true and telling signs of the America that we--and all our citizens--have been helping to build these past four years.', 'I have seen much of this America--as I have travelled across our land these last weeks. And it is a thing of spirit--a thing of splendor.', 'I have seen the faces of hundreds of thousands of our people, and they shine--especially the young--with hope and confidence.', 'I have seen the face of our land--soil, rivers and forests--their richness and their power conserved with care, developed with skill, by a people thankful for this bounty of a generous Providence.', 'And there are other great things that I have had no need to see--for I know them. I mean--all the rolling mills and open hearths, the smoking factory-stacks and flaming furnaces.', 'Tonight--even as we meet here--the glow of these furnaces and the light of these factories send their bright signals to the dark skies above. And they tell the world that 66 million Americans know--today--more secure and rewarding work than any people have ever known--anywhere in the world--anytime in history.', 'My friends, all this--all of us see. But how fantastically different it is from what we have lately been hearing.', 'We have been hearing the complaining chant of a chorus of apparently tireless partisan orators. This chorus sings a strange song--about a weak and fearful America.', 'And in this monotonous music the latest lament is that your present leadership has ""no new ideas.""', ""Now, my friends, if the Administration has no new ideas, then I suppose you don't, because you support it. So shouldn't we together examine this point just a bit?"", 'Now, first of all, not every new idea is necessarily a good one. Four years ago, you will recall, our people were told that if they elected a Republican administration, disaster will overtake the land, we will have depression, prosperity will evaporate. And a little later, with Republicans in power and in their first move to remove stifling controls from the wages and services and rents that were afflicting the land, we were told in the most solemn tones that we were going to have run-away inflation, rising living costs, and finally new disaster. They were new ideas. But, were they really?', 'Now another thing. In 1953, we found a number of old ideas for whose energetic application the American people had waited all too long.', 'It is undoubtedly an old idea to reduce Federal spending and lower Federal taxes. But someone had to do it.', ""It is an old idea to reduce unemployment. But it has taken today's prosperity to reduce the unemployment rate to a level lower this last month than that in any peacetime September in the opposition's twenty years of rule."", 'And how--all action aside--how true is it that the opposition enjoys some monopoly on the invention of new ideas?', 'Was it they who inspired and launched the greatest highway building program in our history?', 'Was it they who proposed the program of Atoms for Peace?', 'Was it they who conceived our boldest proposal for disarmament, the Open Skies offer of mutual air-inspection?', 'Was it they who went to Panama for the first conference of Chiefs of State, in order to bind the Americas more closely together?', 'Now, my friends, I find nothing really new even in their political techniques for confusing public debate. Thus:', ""They charge your Government with indifference to the welfare of labor--but they are careful not to mention that labor's share of our national income stands today at its highest point in twenty years."", 'They charge your Government with excessive concern for big corporations--but they are careful not to mention that corporate profits after taxes since 1953 have represented a sharply lower share of our national income than during the seven postwar years of the preceding administration.', 'Possibly, though, one ""new idea"" has added to such political double-talk a new kind of spice--and this is the hit-and-run statement. They have charged this Administration, for example, with lending vast sums of money to a foreign government that they said built up the personal fortune of an exiled Latin American dictator. They were horrified, for they made only one mistake: they were sitting on their own powder keg when they lit that fuse. And what did they do when they learned it was their Administration that had made these loans? They fled from the scene-and they did so in headlong silence. They have raced out of sight--to bury this issue, no doubt, somewhere far, far down the high, high road.', 'Now, let us turn to matters more serious, my friends, indeed the gravest issue before us: our quest of peace.', ""There is, of course, nothing amusing when the opposition's political techniques are extended to world affairs."", 'They urge a vigorous and realistic policy towards the Communist empire--and they suggest that we begin, in our relations with the Soviet Union, by trusting our national safety to agreements that have no effective safeguards and no controls.', 'They urge a bold American defense of freedom--and they urge us to try achieving this by starting to plan to end our military draft.', 'I respond to such propositions with one firm belief. There is no political campaign that justifies the declaration of a moratorium on common sense.', 'As your President, I cannot and will not tell you that our quest for peace will be simple, or its rewards swift. This quest may, in fact, cost us much--in labor and in sacrifice.', 'And I do not doubt the will and the ability of America to meet this mighty responsibility with a memorable response.', 'But that response requires, most clearly, strength. For a weak nation can bring neither hope to its own people nor help to its friends. It can only seek mercy of its enemies.', 'This indispensable strength demands of us certain simple things, beyond the power of partisan polemics to obscure.', ""We need our military draft--for the safety of our nation. We cannot throw the full future military burden upon veterans who have already earned their own nation's gratitude--nor can we urge our allies to shoulder arms--while we throw ours to the ground."", 'We need--no less--the most advanced military weapons. And these must be proven to be the best in the world.', ""And we need, also, to reiterate--as we constantly do--America's instant readiness to lay aside all nuclear weapons--including their testing--when, but only when, we have sure safeguards that others will do exactly the same. And it is very important that we get this issue clear in our minds."", 'The compelling challenge before the world is not the matter of testing nuclear weapons--but of making impossible their use in any nuclear war. It is to this far greater purpose that all efforts of your Government have steadfastly been dedicated-through months and years of tireless negotiation, with both firm friend and potential foe.', 'In this mission of peace, we shall never rest--nor ever retreat. For I continue hopefully to believe that all nations can together find the road leading toward--not the illusion--but the reality of disarmament.', 'My fellow citizens, even as we have prospered and grown strong, yet we know that this is not enough. Man does not live by might alone. Nor are we content with pleasing contrasts between today and yesterday. We are concerned with the conquest of tomorrow.', 'We seek--first--the assuring of justice and dignity in our own society.', 'How do we propose to seek it?', 'We shall continue economic and fiscal policies that have helped generate our present prosperity. Soon there will be 70 million jobs for our people, marking another milestone in our eternal growth.', 'We shall continue expanding and improving all our programs for the benefit of the sick, the aged, and the disabled.', 'We shall--for the youth to whom the future belongs--build the schools they need.', 'We shall--with the next Congress--advance new programs to make more secure the future of our small businesses.', 'And we shall--with intelligence and sympathetic understanding-do all in our power to make more secure, for all citizens, their civil fights. And, as a special item of this matter, we shall seek, as we promised in our Platform, to assure women everywhere in our land equality of rights.', ""We shall vigorously lead the way to a review and revision of our immigration laws--to serve our own national interest, to promote understanding in the world, and to give new validity to America's role of leadership in this world."", 'My friends, all this is the work that all of us--you--your Congress, and your President must--and shall--advance in the next four years.', 'And we shall act with like vigor and purpose in the whole wide world.', 'We shall encourage, more persistently than ever, wider markets and rising living standards for all nations.', 'We shall go on steadfastly seeking safe and sound means for disarmament--so that history can never say that this generation left humanity to be crucified upon a cross of iron.', 'And we shall never seek escape from any toil or any sacrifice-that freedom demands of us. We know--above all things--that a people that values its privileges above its principles-soon loses both.', 'Thus will our spirit rule and direct our might.', 'And thus may we go on building this America of justice and strength, in a world of peace and of law.', 'Thank you, my friends, very much indeed.']",1
25,Dwight D. Eisenhower ,"October 29, 1956","['Mr. Chairman, Mr. Hiser, my West Point classmate, General James Van Fleet--My Fellow Citizens:', ""I have been advised that it is a waste of time for me to visit the South this year. And of course I was told that four years ago. But I have been told that Florida's decision in 1952 was a sheer political accident--never to be repeated. But even if that opinion were right--and I don't believe it for a minute--I can still thank you for your support in 1952. And I do, with all my heart."", 'Likewise, I am delighted that the First Florida District sent William C. Kramer to our Congress. I hope they re-elect him, and I hope that by that re-election they recognize his good work.', 'I commend to you of this District Mr. Leland Hiser. In other Districts, G. M. Nelson, Arnold Lund and Mrs. Dorothy Smith. All of them are present here today. And I assure you, I can use their support in Washington.', 'But let me make one thing clear, whatever your decision this year--whatever it may be--Florida continues to be every bit as important to me as any other State as long as I am President.', 'And this gives me an opportunity to ask you, for these last few days of the campaign, to work just a little bit harder to make certain that everybody votes. Let them vote for us if we can possibly get them to do so--but by all means vote, even if they have to vote in a mistaken way. What we must do, my friends, is to make certain that America makes the decision, not just a small minority.', 'Now the sight of Miami from the air--as I saw it a few minutes ago--always amazes me. There seems to be no limit to your capacity to grow. You get bigger and bigger.', 'And so for the political pessimists who think Americans can accomplish nothing unless government bureaucracy does it for them, I have a prescription. This is it:', '""Go to Miami. Just spend a few hours there. See what the people of that area have done on their own, for themselves and for the good of our whole country.""', 'Now, of course, this prescription is not going to cure the dismay of those politicians who deal in pessimism and gloom. They would be out of business, if they had to drop prophesying misfortune and disaster.', 'You know, whatever happened to that 1952 battle cry of theirs, ""Don\'t let them take it away""? The fact is that this year they have become desperate in their failure to make you think that prosperity is poverty, that progress is really stagnation, that high employment is an illusion, that every social and economic gain of the past four years is just a myth.', 'And so, my friends, as these political alarmists come into the final innings of this contest, we find them swinging wildly, knocking a lot of foul balls--and striking out.', 'I, for one, have never been pessimistic about America--present or future. And you people, clearly, have never suffered from such pessimism either. That is why you get things done.', 'Florida today is typical of what is best in America.', ""You have dreams--visions about the future. But you don't just think and talk about them. You get going on them."", ""You have a wealth of natural and human resources here. But you just don't brag about them. You use them."", 'The consequence is a diversified economy, a widely shared prosperity that--great as it is today--merely forecasts the advances you will make in the years ahead.', ""Now, I should like to show you, my friends, that the entire State of Florida and its progress today is vindication of this Administration's policy that the American people, first:"", 'Given freedom from war and uneasiness about their defenses against war, can use the new knowledge of modern science and its new tools, to build a prosperity unparalleled in our history.', 'The American people, given freedom from punitive taxation and from extravagance in the use of their taxes, can use the money thereby saved to invest in more comfortable homes, and in better schools--in all the enterprises that make America a good place to live in.', 'The American people, given freedom from bureaucratic controls and usurpation of responsibility, can achieve any material objective they set themselves. They can do it without the slightest diminution of their freedom, their initiative, or their spirit.', 'The policy of this Administration--foreign and domestic--is the concrete and factual expression of the pledges I made to you four years ago:', 'I pledged, first: That we would build a sound security system for America and would work tirelessly for freedom among men and for peace with justice in the world. This we have done, and we continue so to work.', 'I promised to give you an Executive Branch of your government of integrity and dignity, made up of people of unimpeachable character and ability and we have done so.', 'I pledged: That we would fight waste in government, balance the budget, cut taxes and do a better job at the same time. And we have.', 'By fighting waste in government, we cut 10 billion dollars from the budget that was handed to us by the prior administration. We gave to the American people the largest tax cut in our whole history--7 billion dollars and more. And we have balanced the budget, and even made a small payment on our national debt.', 'And, my friends, I pledged this: That we would make the Federal Government once again what the Founding Fathers intended it to be and what a majority of Americans have always wanted it to be: a partner of the States and a servant of the people. And we have. And we are still doing so.', 'Four years ago I pledged as President of all the people, I would use every proper influence of my office to promote for all citizens that equality before the law and of opportunity visualized by our Founding Fathers. I promised further to do this with the conviction that progress toward equality had to be achieved finally in the hearts of men rather than in legislative halls. I urged then, as I urge now, the handling of this question, to the greatest possible extent, on a state and local basis. I believed then, as I believe now, that there must be intelligent understanding of the human factors and emotions involved, if we are to make steady progress in the matter, rather than simply to make political promises never intended to be kept.', 'In this whole question, my friends, we have tried to bring reason, good sense and good judgment to the performance of clear duty. We have earnestly tried to keep it from becoming a partisan matter, for we are talking here, not about a political issue, but about justice for Americans. The very great progress we have made these past four years has been based on these simple, sensible principles.', 'Now, all these things we in Washington have done. And you here in Miami, men and women like you all across the United States, have done the rest. Our prosperity is the product of your confidence and energy and ability.', 'One thing we must of course remember: The United States cannot exist as an island of prosperity in a world of poverty.', 'For that reason, the growing economic strength of other free nations, and particularly of those countries bound in common purpose with us within the friendly framework of NATO, is a matter of deep satisfaction. That we have had a part in bringing it to pass makes this economic progress even more gratifying.', 'Nothing has been more heartening than the recent announcement of two new proposals that would advance further the economic integration of Europe.', 'The first is the concept that six Western European countries might establish a common market in which all internal barriers to trade would be completely eliminated, just as they are within the United States. The second is the challenging idea that, thereafter, Great Britain, in association with other countries on the European Continent might gradually, over a period of years, establish a free trade area around the common market.', 'We shall watch these exciting new developments with the keenest interest. Because, my friends, as Europe grows stronger economically, we gain in every way. And Florida, facing this great market for its products, will particularly profit.', 'Developments such as these have a far more enduring effect than scarehead forebodings publicized in political campaigns.', 'Our world of friends is far larger than Europe, of course. To the south of us lies a vast continent with tens of millions of peoples, our physical and spiritual neighbors.', 'From the first days of this Administration, we have been devoted to strengthening our ties with them; to opening up new avenues of trade between us and them; to establishing a true partnership based on mutual understanding and genuine friendship. Such a partnership between North America and Latin America can be mutually profitable beyond any similar one in the world.', 'In building this partnership, much has been done in the past four years. Naturally, our opponents deny that. But they cannot seem to keep straight even such simple things as names and dates and places and loans--particularly to whom and by whom loans are made.', 'It was right here in Miami, my friends, that a candidate for the Presidency charged that this Administration had loaned a lot of money to another country, and that the money was used to swell the personal fortunes of a dictator later deposed.', 'The candidate was eloquent in his expression of his sense of resentment--astonishment--chagrin--and shock.', 'But what happened when he found that it was the preceding administration and not mine--that made this loan?', ""Suddenly this sense of shock, astonishment, chagrin, disappeared, because we haven't heard another word about it."", 'Now, my friends, you know the opponents, here, are paying a compliment--deserved, I think--to this Administration. It was shocking to them that we should do anything like this--is the point I want to make.', 'There have been new standards of political and personal morality established in Washington.', 'The meeting of the Presidents at Panama last summer was not the culmination of our effort to make better friends with our neighbors to the southward. Rather, it was a milestone on the road of accomplishment. There with the Presidents or Presidents-elect of almost all other American Republics, I discussed mutual problems and mutual purposes in frank and friendly terms. All of us there recognized that every increase in hemispheric solidarity helps increase hemispheric security and prosperity.', 'Your Administration intends to continue and to amplify the search for better ways to expand trade and travel between the Americas. We shall also increase the exchange of students and of cultural knowledge, and strengthen all the ties that join us together as a single family.', 'Now you of the Miami area have already done much to develop recognition of our mutual hemispheric interests and to promote a friendly solidarity. For one thing, the first impression of the United States that the visitor from Latin America gets, here in Miami, is the finest possible introduction to the energy, the vision and the spirit of our entire country.', 'And so now, at this natural gateway to the islands of the Caribbean and the nations of South America, you envision a great Inter-American Cultural and Trade Center.', 'You have set for yourselves, indeed, a most worthy objective: to help promote an American continental neighborhood.', 'And the American hemisphere must be a neighborhood that is safe and prosperous and happy--at peace, for in a world of peace we can pool our creative intellects, our natural resources, our human energies to the betterment of all who live in both Americas.', 'Now, my fellow citizens, for one moment let me speak most seriously about something that can have no possible partisan connotations.', 'Even as we speak this day of our hopes and strivings for peace and justice in the world, we know that there persists real and present danger to that peace. This danger rises in various places; none more critical at this moment than at the ancient crossroads of the world, the Middle East, where whole civilizations meet. Ancient animosities flare anew. Fears and hatreds deeply divide nations--with all of whom America would be, hopes and seeks to be, a friend.', 'In such a critical situation, we cannot expect to erase suddenly the bitter heritage of the ages. We can--we must--and we shall--go on striving to do all in our power to heal old wounds, rather than to let them re-open--in bloodshed.', 'We can--and we do--use the full moral power of America to direct the purposes of all nations away from conflict--and toward concord. And we are able to do this because all the world knows that we have no national ambition adversely affecting any other. We covet no land no authority over others. We want only to serve the cause of a just and lasting peace for all people.', 'You--you in this throng--in all Miami--and Florida--and throughout America--everybody--are dedicated to this kind of universal peace. To that dedication I pledge the resources of your government for as long as you choose to continue me in my present duties.', 'We shall press our search for peace from a position of strength-spiritual, intellectual, economic, military strength. We shall take no step for the winning of a transitory acclaim that might reduce by one iota the security of this Republic.', 'But we shall never hesitate to take any step that is constructive and prudent, that will advance the cause of a just, lasting, international peace. In this quest--in this greatest quest of mankind--in this great crusade, I seek your help--the help of every single American in the land.', 'My friends, my thanks for your courteous attention and for coming out to this place to see me.', 'Thank you.']",1
26,Dwight D. Eisenhower ,"October 29, 1956","['Mr. Chairman, General Van Fleet--My Fellow Citizens:', 'I should first like to take advantage of this opportunity to pay a personal tribute to a great Floridian, General Van Fleet. He was one of the few men who, in World War Two, led a regiment across the beaches and at the moment of victory was a three-star General commanding a corps.', 'Next, I want to pay my personal tribute to Florida. Here is a place I like to come. I regret sincerely that my visit today can touch only two of your cities, and that only briefly. Had I the opportunity to go through your cities and streets, not only here and in Miami but throughout all the other towns of Florida, I would deem it a very great honor and privilege.', 'Florida is lucky in one way. Here was the scene of a battleground between a pair of opponents we now have--who are seeking the Presidency and the Vice Presidency respectively. You learned a great deal about them, particularly you learned about each of them from the other, and you learned about the depth of admiration, the great respect, that each had for the other, and about the qualifications that each felt and said that the other one had for the great Office of the Presidency.', 'Now there is one question that we could answer very quickly then, I think, this afternoon, since you know these things: Do we want this pair in Washington?', 'Well, that is what you are going to decide on November 6th.', 'I want to talk to you today a little bit about the problem of making a living.', 'Now we know that man does not live by bread alone, but we do know that making his daily bread is his preoccupation during his working hours.', ""We are very, very grateful for the record of prosperity that these past four years has brought to us. Now the opposition not only says this is a false prosperity, they even say it doesn't exist. Just exactly how they expect to make you believe it, I have never been sure--but they have done many things that are puzzling to me. But I must say this very seriously, they paint a false picture of America's economic might, her economic capacity to produce whatever she needs to produce for peace or if a tragedy of war should come, for that."", 'Now for some reason or other, the opposition has seen fit to paint a picture of gloom at home and doom abroad; and we can examine exactly What has been happening, to see just how much substance there is to this.', 'I would like to make one observation: If you do play politics with our great prosperity, it is just possible that you could destroy it. That, we shall not let happen.', 'In 1952 you voted very decisively--very emphatically--for a change.', ""Now let's see what difference there has been. Now in Washington there is a very big difference. First from Washington, the mess has disappeared. Only the highest standards, not only of law but of ethics are tolerated in the Executive Branch of the Federal government; and that is, cleaning up the mess."", 'Instead of running in the red, your government is running in the black. Instead of higher taxes, you have lower taxes. Instead of indifference, neglect and waste, you have honest, efficient government. Instead of the black depression our opponents so confidently predicted in 1952--if you were foolish enough to elect any administration except theirs--we have created--you have created--the greatest prosperity in all history.', 'And so no more do you hear the wail--that 1952 wail: ""Don\'t let them take it away."" The standards of 1952 are far back along the path of America\'s continuing progress. You have record payrolls, and most important of all, you do not have daily casualty lists.', ""Now there's a very large difference in our beliefs. By their past deeds, or their words, the opposition seems to believe that centralized, paternalistic government is necessary in this country. They minimize the function of the State government, and they seem to think that the ordinary citizen knows how to make a living only if they tell him how."", 'They seem to think that inflation--the inflation that robs our pocketbooks--is not really so bad. They claim to have a very great concern for those who are living on social security payments--those people who are living on pensions or upon their bonds. Now, my friends, if you pay social security payments today from your payrolls, and they are paid off 20 years from now in twenty-cent dollars, you are the sufferers--not the rich, not the big corporations; you, the people that live on that kind of fixed income.', 'So let\'s not have any of this business of inflation, unless we are concerned only with the big man and not their so called ""little men.""', 'And finally, they seem to think that fiscal integrity is not nearly so important to a nation as you know it is in your own family. How they get this idea, I am not sure--but they say, I guess you can print dollars; and again we have inflation.', 'We believe that the strength of a nation is in its people. We believe that it is people that count. It is your desire to work-to venture--to earn more--to own more--to better your position, your family, your community.', 'That is what makes America tick.', 'That is what brings our prosperity.', 'What the government can do is to create the climate in which you can realize and fulfill your ambitions. The government cannot make you prosperous.', 'And so, because you have had this government that trusts you, and therefore you are trusting them, giving you the confidence to go ahead, you have created an economy that is now racing forward at a level of above four hundred billion dollars a year. And that is without the help--the tragic help of a war.', 'In 1930 we had peace, but no prosperity. In the next decade-the forties--we had a great deal of prosperity, but we had no peace. Now we have both--the creation of you--working with your government.', 'So today we have more than 66 million Americans gainfully employed. And only today--since I started on this trip from Washington--I have received information, soon to be released in detail, that employment for the month of October is up over last month, and up a million over October of last year. That, my friends, makes it the biggest October in our entire history.', 'And on top of that, let us compare it for just one moment with October of 1952.', 'There are today four million, 300 thousand more jobs, with people gainfully employed in them, than there were four years ago. Real wages are at an all-time high. And by real wages, I mean after you have paid your taxes, after you have paid for any rise in the living costs, your real wages are still up 8.5 percent. And there is certainly nothing false about that kind of prosperity. You are not on a treadmill, with the cost of living going up just as fast as wage increases--as they used to do.', 'Now you make the gain. And so these real wages make more work--cars, houses, churches, schools, vacations, more ball games, more concerts, more savings--more of everything that every human being wants for himself and his family.', 'Never before in history have our working men and women enjoyed-all at the same time--increasing wages and decreasing income tax returns, and such a remarkably stable cost of living.', 'So there is a story, my friends--more production, more jobs, more income--a prosperity never before so great, never before so widely shared.', ""This makes it truly a people's prosperity."", 'Now this prosperity has been achieved by you, working in a favorable climate, fostered by your Administration.', 'Now, what did we do to bring this about?', 'Well, we promised to end the Korean War. And we did.', 'We promised to free the economy of stifling controls on wages and prices. And we did. And do you remember the dire predictions when we removed controls in 1953? The so-called economists of the opposition predicted great runaway inflation, to be followed by depression, with all America practically out of work.', 'On the contrary! There has been real prosperity, most widely shared than it has been--ever--in our history.', 'And then we promised to balance the budget. And we did that. And paid something on our debts. And, my friends, when a national debt has reached the astounding total of 275 billion dollars, to pay a little bit on the debt looks like it is a very, very wise thing to do.', 'And when we cut taxes in 1954--as we promised to do--we cut taxes so that it benefited every man, woman and child in the United States--two-thirds of that 7-billion-dollar tax cut going directly to individuals.', 'And we promised integrity and thrift and efficiency in government. And we delivered on that promise.', 'We promised to take the government out of competition with private business. We have made great strides in doing so, with special benefit to small business.', 'Now we promised, also, to lift from our working men and women some of the anxieties of life. We are proud of the expansion of social security benefits, of broadening unemployment insurance, of strengthened health programs, and many other things done to provide more security and care for the old, the infirm, or the unemployed.', 'Government can have and has had a heart--as well as a head.', 'I am quite sure you will not let the prophets of expediency tell you anything different. You can refer them to the list of facts piled up in these last four years.', 'What I have said, my friends, is not to be taken as indicating that we are at all satisfied with what has been done. The job of improving and building America will never be finished.', 'We can--and there are programs afoot--increase our prosperity, particularly extend it to those who are not yet sharing fully in it. Certain areas, and particular parts of our farm industry have been particularly affected, and the programs devised by your government are carrying the fair share of that prosperity to those areas.', 'Then there are other sections of chronic unemployment. This is due to the changes in our economic scene. For example, in the coal industry, as coal falls off in use, something replaces it--there results unemployment. In the shifting of industries from north to south or east to west, unemployment comes about. There are broad programs now afoot to make certain that these difficulties are overcome, with the help of the government, and people can be fully employed again.', 'Low-income families, whether they be in the city or on the farm, or whether it be clearing of slums and helping in soil conservation--we are attacking all of these problems, with the help of the people affected themselves.', 'Now, my friends, literally thousands of letters come into the White House per week. At this time of year, particularly of an election year, these have mostly to do with some phase of our political contest. Lately, I notice that the letters coming into the White House have been--a majority of them--from young people, many of them from GIs--many of them from GIs with whom I served.', 'This question appears, directly or indirectly, in almost all of those letters:', 'What kind of America are we headed for? What kind of America are we and our children to have?', ""Now the answer: Most of it is up to you, and to millions of Americans like you over this land. You have a choice. You can take a chance with your children's future--you can go back to the leadership and the program you turned down in 1952."", 'Or, you can continue the crusade we launched four years ago: the building of an America that is secure and peaceful--an America of unmatched prosperity and opportunity--an America realizing the golden age of promise.', 'This is the question that these young people want answered.', 'Consider what the dimensions and character of that age can be. It can be an America with an annual production approaching the 600-billion-dollar mark in another ten years. It can be an America rising to fill new employment at a rate of one million jobs a year, a total of more than 70 million jobs four years hence--an America whose spreading prosperity will mightily support our efforts to wipe out the last vestiges of poverty and discrimination.', '[An airplane goes overhead]: I will abandon the contest for a moment.', ""It can be an America living at peace with itself, dedicated to the ideals of our founding documents--opportunity--justice-- equality before the law. It can be an America leading the search for a just and lasting peace in the world and--with God's help--succeeding."", 'Now let me make very clear, my friends: the winning of peace will not be easy. It is going to call for ceaseless work. It will mean sacrifice, not merely in the national sense but often for each of us.', ""But let us remember the price--the value--that people who have once known liberty and freedom place upon it. We need not go far back in history to our own brave days of the Revolution and since. We look today across the seas, and we see Poland and Hungary--we see people so dedicated to the idea of man's rights, to man's dignity, to his freedom, his liberty, that they are willing to die."", 'There is a very, very serious lesson for us, that each day we resolve, as we go about our work, that the one thing we will not have to do is compromise with our individual liberty and our national independence.', 'And because peace is very intimately tied up with this love of liberty, it is essential that America not only foster and sustain this yearning for liberty in our own nation, but that we do it elsewhere.', 'A free nation does not seek war, because the decisions in a free nation are made by the people that fight the wars.', 'So it is absolutely to our advantage and in our own interests that we foster this yearning and respect for liberty wherever it appears in the world.', 'Now, to serve liberty--to serve people--America must be strong, strong in our hearts, in our dedication to ideals--strong in our support of the political concepts handed down to us by our forefathers. We must have this great economic strength growing every day--and continuing to grow.', 'And we must have military strength. A strong America, my friends, is the hope of our own people, and it is a help to our friends. And just as important, it is particularly valuable that any potential enemy know of our strength, and is thereby deterred from the tragic folly of attacking us.', 'We know in our own experiences, weakness cannot lead and weakness cannot cooperate. Weakness can merely ask--it can beg--it can seek. But it cannot help.', 'Strength can help.', 'So, my friends, we must be concerned about the peace of the world. We must miss no opportunity to use our entire imagination to give to the pursuit of peace our entire dedication. But we can show that concern without being careless.', ""So I say, at this particular stage of the world's history, where we see a once proud people being trampled down by marching regiments, this is no time to stop the draft--this is no time to stop perfecting our weapons."", ""And remember, my friends, I don't say and I do not believe we should be seeking to make bigger and stronger and more destructive weapons. Our science is now directed to: how do we use this new science to protect ourselves, to make defense weapons, to make them small and dean, and make them more suitable for military objectives instead of civilian cities."", 'And so I say, let us make every possible agreement we can to reduce the risks in the world, but let us do it with the proper safeguards.', 'But finally, every phase of our national effort--our economy-our prosperity-our opportunities for education--everything that we want--depends upon progress in this reach for peace. We must move ever forward. We must not let anything tire us. We must never let anything wear out our patience--no matter how serious the problem. We must simply say, ""Then we work the harder.""', ""We must reach a state in the world where you and I--as well as potential opponents--can have confidence that agreements are sound, and we can live with, devoting our efforts and our sweat and our labor to peace--not to war. And this means that as we make a life--as we make this living that we work for day to day, we will also work out a way of life for our nation and--with God's help--for the world."", 'My friends, I have only one request to make upon you today. What I have been talking about--opportunity--the richness of the heritage of America--the opportunity to help produce peace in the world--is in your hands, in a very definite measure.', 'If you will exercise the rights--the privileges--as well as discharging the obligations of your citizenship, you will vote, and record your convictions and your opinions.', 'Of course, if you can vote for the side in which we believe, that is all to the good. But in any event: vote! Be sure you do it, and get everybody else to do it.']",1

I do apologize for the lateness of the hour. But things happened that we couldn't prevent. In any event, because you stayed here, I want to thank each of you personally on behalf of myself, my wife--my whole party."", ""Now I am especially regretful that I could not stay here on this trip long enough actually to visit your historic city. But I determined that at the very least I would stop here momentarily, if I could do nothing else than merely to pay my respects to this State where so many of America's patriots had their homes--and where on the more personal side my mother was born and spent her girlhood."", 'Now always when I do come here, I feel inspired by the giant figures Virginia has brought forth on the American scene--from Washington to Lee, to Woodrow Wilson, to my old chief and friend, George Marshall--one of the truly great men of this generation.', 'Through all history, certain concepts have seemed to characterize Virginia leaders. You believe in honesty and integrity and dignity in government--in all echelons. Moreover, you believe in doing things yourselves. You want State and local authority preserved. In Washington you want a proper respect for the constitutional division of powers between Federal and State governments. Your tradition is that big central government is likely to be bad government, that the freer our people are to run their own affairs, the better off all will be.', 'And as for the simple, old-fashioned virtue of not spending more than you make, you have here in Virginia the living symbol of this concept: Senator Harry Byrd. I am proud to pay my respects to him. He is true to your great heritage for efficiency in government, elimination of extravagance, strong local government--these concepts were as dear to Thomas Jefferson as they are to your leaders today.', 'Now, of such concepts, my friends, is what I intended to speak to you tonight, however briefly. They have been in my thoughts since this campaign began. But out of regard for the lateness of the hour, and for the length of time you have been here, let me say this:', 'I would like to visit with you just a little while personally. You have heard all the arguments pro and con. You know what I and my associates promised to you four years ago. We promised to restore honesty and integrity in government. We promised to cut useless government expenditures, and to return to the people the taxes we could thus save. We promised to work for full employment for everybody, for an increasing prosperity, widely shared throughout this nation.', 'Now, today, four years later, we point to the record. We say, look at it!', 'Now the opposition says to you: you are not prosperous, you are starving--you are poor--we are not working. They pay no attention to statistics, that here this last October we just went up another 100 thousand over the previous month--we had the biggest employment month, in October, in our history. And the lowest unemployment month. These are the things they say are not true.', ""They don't believe that you have cars and television sets, that you are the most prosperous in the world. They say, if it's prosperity, it's false prosperity. Why? I don't know."", ""Now, ladies and gentlemen, they go into the cities and they say, we will keep a sound dollar and we will keep down living costs. They go to the countryside and advocate a loose expenditure of money and carelessness in our fiscal affairs so that they can spend more billions. And in all of this, they are going to balance the budget and cut taxes. This just can't be done."", 'Now, by no means do we of this Administration say, now we have reached the millennium, that peace is here permanently, that we have reached the heights of our possible prosperity, that no one can advance in education or in his intellectual level or anything else.', 'We say: we are on the way, and we are doing it with sound, decent, fiscal policies--with sound methods that will stand as long as the nation will stand.', 'They propose get-rich-quick policies, and pie-in-the-sky promises that have no validity whatsoever.', 'This, I maintain, is the difference between us.', 'Now, through these past four years, there has been one subject that this Administration has lived with, worked with, done more with, than any other; and that is, trying to develop and build the road to peace.', 'Without peace, we cannot have these things that we have been enjoying the past four years. We cannot have lowered taxes, we cannot have prosperity, we cannot have confidence among ourselves.', 'Unless in our generation the world can solve this fearful dilemma, and choose rightly between annihilation and permanent peace, then the future of this country--indeed, of mankind--is bleak indeed.', 'We maintain it can be done.', 'We believe that with the strength of America behind the effort, with every man and woman doing their best to help along the way, we can be strong--and from a position of strength can gradually bring about those conditions that we must bring about, if this world is to be fruitful and serve the purposes and best aspirations of men.', 'With respect to this question of peace: four years ago I promised you to work faithfully--to work with all the force and dedication at my command--in order to win a just peace, a lasting peace.', 'That pledge, I say most earnestly, we have faithfully kept.', 'I am profoundly convinced of this: all that concerns us today, in our homes, in our jobs, in our country, is as nothing compared to the awesome choice now awaiting the decision of mankind.', 'For the race of man, if there is no peace, there will be no hope.', 'The building of that peace is my all-embracing goal.', 'It is my determined, unshakeable, fixed purpose--and so it will ever remain.', 'Three and a half years ago we ended the Korean war. Since then our people have not known the tragedy of daily casualty lists. But as we look to the future, we know that the risks of new Koreas are sure to be there.', 'Yet we know also: from Iran, from Guatemala, from Indochina, from Formosa, from Trieste--that difficult though our road may be, we can--by dedication and endless patience--reach solutions to world tensions by means short of war, when those most affected do not become completely unreasonable.', 'Now, my fellow citizens, even as we speak this day of our hopes and strivings for peace and justice in the world, we know that there persists real and present danger to that peace. This danger is in various places, none more critical at this moment than at the ancient crossroads of the world, the Mid-East, where old civilizations meet and ancient animosities flare anew. Fears and hatreds deeply divide nations, with all of whom America would be, hopes to be, and seeks to be, a friend.', 'Only yesterday I repeated on behalf of America a solemn warning to the people in that area, that America and all the civilized world expects the peace to be kept.', 'The news in this area is not good. But I do say this: In this specific case, as in all our efforts throughout the world for a just and lasting peace, here is my solemn pledge to you: by dedication and patience we will continue, as long as I remain your President, to work for this simple--this single--this exclusive goal.', ""Now, as I repeat on behalf of Mamie and myself our gratitude for your heartwarming welcome, I want to say again that to come back to this Old Dominion--my mother's State--is always a tremendous privilege. And because it was her State, I would like to ask you a special favor."", 'There remain between now and November 6th a few days in which all of us can work to make the decision of America, no matter what it may be, more decisive, more representative, of our whole national thought.', 'So my request is this: first, of course, that you vote. Next, that each of you between now and next Tuesday spend your time trying to get any of those who otherwise might not vote to the polls, so that they register their belief in America, show their respect for the priceless right of voting--and making the decision of America that of all, rather than just a part of our country.', 'For I tell you this: not only would I accept completely and confidently any decision that all America makes, but I do believe that there is something especially thrilling--especially wonderful--which each of us can experience as he walks into the secret place and says, ""Here is my decision for America""--whether it be, in my own case, for my side--or the other. I hope that every citizen will experience that great thrill--that great privilege.', 'Thank you. Goodnight.', '[After an ovation the President added--]', ""Due to the fact that I didn't pay as close attention to my script as I should have, I inadvertently overlooked the opportunity to say a good word for your Congressional candidate in your District: Mr. Cabell.

28,Dwight D. Eisenhower ,"November 01, 1956","['Mr. Chairman, Senator Duff, My Fellow Americans:', 'Our time of national political debate is almost ended. The clamor of these days will soon subside. And your day of thoughtful decision swiftly nears.', ""We meet tonight, of course, in the name of a political party-and I am this party's leader."", ""Now as such--as this party's political leader--and as a fellow Pennsylvanian--I have the privilege of speaking a word about your Senator Duff. Six years ago, my friends, he was in the forefront of those who kept insisting to me that I had a political duty; and he further insisted if I would accept this call to duty, as he labeled it, that I would be elected."", 'This evening, in your name, I would like to say the same to him. And I hope that you send him back to Washington with a full complement of his partners in the Congress of the United States.', 'Now, though I am a party member, before all else, I am your President--responsible not to Republicans or to Democrats, but to all Americans. And I believe it is fitting--in this, my final formal address of this political campaign--to speak to you in this role and in this spirit. I speak to you of the faith and convictions that have guided me--and this Administration--in these past four years. And I make this my simple pledge: This same faith and these convictions of which I speak to you tonight will rule my future conduct--if it be your will that I serve you for the next four years.', 'We have spoken, these last weeks, of many of the serious labors of your government.', 'We have spoken of our abundance and our productive power-providing more rewarding work--for more people--than any people have ever known, anywhere in the world, any time in history.', 'We have spoken of the ways we strengthen the physical resources of our land: highways to join our cities, dams to harness our rivers, ports and waterways to carry our commerce. And we have spoken of all things deeply affecting the welfare of our people: social security and slum clearance--public housing and public health--civil rights and education.', 'We have spoken, too, of the characteristics and methods of your government these last four years. By this I mean: the integrity of public service--commanding the respect of all citizens-and the integrity of economic policies--guarding the real value of the earnings of all our citizens. And I mean also: the steady strengthening--not of central power--but of State and local government-upon which depends the very life of our Constitutional system.', 'And yet--even all these things are not enough. For they are not enough truly to define for what we live--and by what we live. All the historic precedents, the soaring graphs, the staggering statistics--these measure size more than substance. And the largeness and greatness of our nation would be almost a mockery--without a matching greatness of heart and largeness of vision as we look out upon the world.', 'Of these greater things, I speak to you tonight.', 'It seems to me right to do so here, in Philadelphia, where our forefathers defined the principles by which our nation was born and has ever lived.', 'There is further reason for such thoughts this night. Over all the din of our domestic debate, these last weeks, we have heard other sounds--louder still, and urgent with meaning--sounds from across the world. We have heard--with admiration and with hope--the challenging cry for freedom of the peoples of Hungary and of Poland. We have been reminded once again: this love of man for his freedom is the thing that no bullet can kill, no gallows strangle.', 'And now, in these last days, we have heard other sounds of less happy portent. We have heard--with deep dismay--the crack of rifle-fire and the whine of jet-bombers over the deserts of Egypt.', 'In such a world--at such a time--""a decent respect for the opinion of mankind""--in the words of our Declaration of Independence-requires that we state plainly the purposes we seek, the principles we hold.', 'In June of 1776, Richard Henry Lee, rising before the Second Continental Congress to move his resolution for American independence, declared: ""The eyes of Europe are fixed upon us; she demands of us a living example of freedom.""', 'One hundred eighty years later, we know that the eyes of the world are fixed upon us. And we must ask ourselves: what kind of an example of freedom do we give to our age? What are the true marks of our America--and what do they mean to the world?', 'We are a people born of many peoples. Our culture, our skills, our very aspirations have been shaped by immigrants--and their sons and daughters--from all the earth. Sam Gompers from England, Andrew Carnegie from Scotland, Albert Einstein from Germany--and Booker T. Washington and Al Smith--Marconi and Caruso--men of all nations and races and estates--they have made us what we are.', 'Men like these--men by the millions--have deepened and defined our very understanding of what is true and just in the wide world from which they came.', ""We know--as our forefathers knew--the firm ground on which our beliefs must stand. Freedom is rooted in the certainty that the brotherhood of all men springs from the Fatherhood of God. And thus, even as each man is his brother's keeper, no man is another's master."", 'So it is that the laws most binding us as a people are laws of the spirit--proclaimed in church and synagogue and mosque. These are the laws that truly declare the eternal equality of all men, of all races, before the man-made laws of our land. And we are profoundly aware that--in the world--we can claim the trust of hundreds of millions of people, across Africa and Asia-only as we ourselves hold high the banner of justice for all.', 'We are--proudly--a people with no sense of class or caste. We judge no man by his name or inheritance, but by what he does--and for what he stands.', 'And so likewise do we judge other nations. The right of no nation depends upon the date of its birth or the size of its power. As there can be no second-class citizens before the law of America, so--we believe--there can be no second-class nations before the law of the world community.', 'We--finally--look upon change, the ever-unfolding future, with confidence rather than doubt, hope rather than fear. We, as a people, were born of revolution. And we have lived by change--always a frontier people, exploring--if not new wilderness-then new science and new knowledge.', 'And from this springs our understanding of the world, our power to apply to the present the lessons of the past. In but a few years we have changed--we have advanced--from an isolationism spurning collective security--to our steadfast support of the United Nations--from a sense of self-sufficiency and remoteness from other nations--to the vivid awareness that our greatest purpose--a just and lasting peace--can be attained only as all other nations share this peace with us.', 'II.', 'Now, as we have witnessed in these very weeks momentous events throughout the world, we have applied these principles by which America must ever live--and strive to lead.', 'In Eastern Europe, we have seen the spirit of freedom--swift and strong--strike through the darkness. The peoples of Poland and Hungary, brave as ever through all their history, have offered their lives to live in liberty. And as the people have risen, so have new governments--and so has new hope.', 'In all of this the true intent of the Soviet Union seems not yet clear. We are only today--troubled by news of new Soviet efforts to suppress the people of Hungary by force. If this be true, this is a black day of sorrow. But the Soviet Union has declared its readiness to reshape oppressive policies of a decade-and to contemplate withdrawal of its armed forces from Poland and Hungary and Rumania. If this be true--and if this be done--there could be in the making a bright new day of justice and of trust among all nations.', 'It is timely to ask: How have we practiced our principles at this historic moment?', 'We have always made clear that we would never renounce our hope and concern for these lands and peoples.', ""We have denounced--before the world forum of the United Nations--the Soviet use of force in its attempt to suppress these peoples' risings. And we ourselves have abstained from use of force--knowing it to be contrary to both the interests of these peoples, and to the spirit and methods of the United Nations."", ""And we have welcomed these events seeking for no selfish advantage. We seek from these peoples neither material gain nor military alliance. We seek simply their freedom--for their sake, and for freedom's sake."", 'We have, in these same days, been submitted to a less hopeful--a much sterner--test of our principles. A test--I believe it is--by which the world will judge us, for long to come.', 'The United Nations--within 48 hours of its being called to consider the matter of foreign--Soviet--forces in Hungary-was called to judge the use of foreign forces in Egypt.', 'I, as your President, am proud--and I trust that you are proud--that the United States declared itself against the use of force in, not one, but both these cases.', ""I hope you may allow me, at this moment, to make a serious personal comment. I have been profoundly heartened by messages I have received in these past days from Congressional members of both political parties. These messages have pledged support--earnest support--of America's decision to choose a path of honor. This--I am thankful to say--is the same spirited bipartisan support I have received and welcomed at many like moments of decision in these past four years. Those moments of decision have involved Korea and Formosa, Guatemala, and the Summit at Geneva. And as a consequence of this bipartisan support, I assure you, my friends, I have been undisturbed by the strident voices of those few who seem to be seeking to turn world events to political profit. For I know--as we look out upon this world of ours: This America is not divided. And let me say, I shall continue to take all actions and decisions in these times-not as a candidate for office, but as President of all the people of the United States."", 'And now, a few words about the principles that we have followed in making particular decisions.', 'First, we cannot and we will not condone armed aggression-no matter who the attacker, and no matter who the victim.', 'We cannot--in the world, any more than in our own nation-subscribe to one law for the weak, another law for the strong; one law for those opposing us, another for those allied with us.', 'There can be only one law--or there will be no peace.', 'We do not speak--let me emphasize--in any angry spirit of self-righteousness.', 'We value--deeply and lastingly--the bonds with those great nations, those great friends, with whom we now so plainly disagree. And I, for one, am confident that those bonds will do more than survive. They can--my friends, they must--grow to new and greater strength.', 'But this we know above all: there are some firm principles that cannot bend--they can only break. And we shall not break ours.', 'We believe that integrity of purpose and act is the fact that must, most surely, identify and fortify the free world in its struggle against communism.', 'We cannot proclaim this integrity when the issue is easy--and stifle it when the issue is hard.', 'To do this would be to do something much worse than merely making our great struggle in the world more difficult. For if we were ever to lose that integrity--there would be no way to win a true victory in that struggle.', 'This would be a surrender that we shall not make.', 'My fellow citizens, we look beyond these days, and we say: We shall continue to practice the peace that we preach.', 'We believe that humanity must now cease preying upon itself. We believe that the power of modern weapons makes war not only perilous--but preposterous--and the only way to win World War III is to prevent it.', 'And so we continue to build our strength, not to wage war, but to be spared war. We can judge today the need of this strength by a simple question: would we feel safe or secure as a nation--if we--say five years ago in the past--had already ceased perfecting our military weapons and even abandoned our military draft? That is no formula for peace. It is a design for disaster.', 'But let me say, we hold--firmly--to a vital paradox and to a fixed purpose: we maintain strength only in order some day to yield it--in league with all other nations. We shall go on working ceaselessly for the sure and safe accord that alone will make this possible. For we seek, above all else, to lift--from the backs of men and all nations--their terrible burden of armaments.', 'Finally--ever constant in the principles by which we live--we sense a special concern for the fate and fortune of those 700 million people--in 18 nations--who have won full independence since World War II. We know and respect both their national pride and their economic need.', 'Here we speak from the heart of our heritage. We, too, were born at a time when the tide of tyranny, running high, threatened to sweep the earth. We prevailed. And they shall prevail. For the everlasting promise of our own Declaration of Independence was what Lincoln declared it to be: ""Liberty not alone to the people of this country, but hope for the world for all future time.""', ""These, then, are America's greater purposes."", 'They spring from our final faith in freedom.', 'And they summon to our minds another moment of greatness. It was here in Philadelphia, and it was in 1787. The Constitutional Convention had come to its end. Its long deliberations were done, and the principles of our nation had been defined. At that moment, Benjamin Franklin pointed to the chair where Washington had been sitting. There--on the back--was painted, in brilliant gold, the half sun. And Franklin said quietly: ""Now--at length--I have the happiness to know that it is a rising, not a setting sun.""', 'We--today--scan the wider horizon--of the whole world.', 'Proud of our principles, persistent in peace--we prayerfully may dare to see the same rising of the sun.', 'Thank you, my friends, very much.']",1

I think I scarcely need explain to you how immediately pressing the affairs of government have been for the past few days, and I am sure. you understand thoroughly why I thought it inadvisable, if not impossible, to make the trip.', ""Now, as I address you this evening, I want to say, first, a word to those friends who believe as I do about the affairs of government and the philosophy that it follows in dealing with its people and with others. It is that we need through all echelons of government support to carry out the programs that you know are classed as the Administration's programs. And so I think it not out of place that I should commend to you the election of Sumner Whittier and your slate of State candidates in Massachusetts."", 'I am pleased, of course, for the chance to greet many old friends, Joe Martin, Chris Herter, and Senator Leverett Saltonstall. And then among your Congressional candidates, all of whom I hope you will elect--I want to mention especially Laurence Curtis, Gene Farnam, Mary Wheeler and Foster Doty. It is my conviction that those that you will vote on tomorrow would be very helpful in pushing the program in which I so firmly believe.', 'Now in this campaign which is so rapidly drawing to a close, my associates and I have gone up and down the land contrasting the conditions of 1952 with those of today--1956.', 'We think the record is a very good one, but we have not done this, I assure you, just to be boasting. There is so much yet to be done that no honest, humble man would be boasting. But we have offered these proofs--these actions--that show where promises have been kept as proof of what we will do with the pledges we have yet to make.', 'So we have talked about our strength, and in both defensive strength and our economic strength, as proof of the keeping of pledges we have made in the past. We have done the same about the fiscal integrity of the government. That is why, also, we have talked about more jobs and better pay. We have talked about tax cuts, and we have talked about personal security. All of these things, as I say, are merely to recall to your minds that we have made pledges about them. We made similar pledges about the efforts to assist areas that have not been sharing equitably in the general prosperity of the country. As you know, we have developed many ways and means of helping them, including some tax cuts, other types of help, that involves government procurement, and so on.', 'So, all this persistent work has been done so as to translate into actual action, for the benefit of all Americans, the pledges that we have made to you in the past.', 'But there is so much to do. Many things yet unfinished. For example, we need schools--we need them desperately--we need them now. We need more help for these lagging areas--areas that have been damaged either by industries and factories moving to other areas or because industries in which they were engaged, such as mining, have suffered losses due to changes in the types of fuel used by industry.', 'Small business needs still more attention, and there will be bills submitted to the Congress for translating into laws to help them out.', 'New highways--we have got a highway program launched. Now we must push it, and that highway program itself does not represent at all everything that we must do.', 'Airports--new airports--new safety measures--means to make certain that air travel constantly increases in its safety as it increases in its speed.', 'Health and special programs for the aged are another of the things that still must be carried forward to new levels.', 'One thing that has lagged, although we have made some little progress, is immigration. Our immigration laws and how they affect the various areas of the world, and indeed how they affect us and our own future welfare--we will submit to the Congress renewed recommendations as to how these immigration laws may be better adjusted to our needs.', 'And of course, with all of this, we shall continue the effort-always--to keep government honest, fair and just. And that only fiscal integrity will characterize the monetary policies of your government.', 'Now, outside of the United States, the great objective of all true Americans remains: world peace.', 'Now, in recent days we have had many crises that have tested our readiness to stand by principle. Justice--justice is a necessary part of world peace, because without justice there will be no peace. And there must be one law for all, not just one for us and one for the others. We must have one law that rules us all.', 'And then, because of the events in Eastern Europe, our hearts have gone out to the people of Poland, and to Hungary, and we shall have given them the promise, not only that we shall never forget them and hold them dear in our hearts, but we have made offers of economic help--food, shelter, clothing, medicines-which we sincerely hope they may be able to accept.', 'So in those two areas we rejoice that two of the great Cardinals-symbols of freedom and the desire for liberation--two others have recently been at least temporarily liberated: the great Cardinals, both of Poland and Hungary.', 'So, alive to the needs of people, we will keep working for the kind of peace that we have always promised you--one that all the world can participate in.', 'Now, in the months ahead, we will need your support just as much as we have in this campaign. For the support you have given us, we thank you sincerely. But if we are all going to work together, we must start out by voting tomorrow. Indeed, no matter how you vote, be sure you vote. Because tonight I can assure you: In all the world there is no privilege that is more priceless and more sought after than the privilege that is yours tomorrow.', 'To keep it alive--for ourselves, for our children, for our country-for freedom: exercise it.

We regret deeply we couldn't go to Boston and stop at Hartford on the way, as we had planned."", ""As a matter of fact, one of the disappointments of this campaign was that I couldn't go to the State of my birth, Texas. I had to cancel that engagement, and on the way back I wanted to visit two other States that had honored me with their support-Dick and me--in 1952. That was in Tennessee and Oklahoma. But there the wish will just have to be accepted for the deed-because we simply couldn't do it."", 'Now, in these past four years, as I have been working here in the White House, I have--with others of my associates and friends--worked out a simple set of principles that we try to apply to every problem of government that we meet.', 'The first of these is very simple--very true--as all of you know. And it is this: the individual is of supreme importance.', 'Now, as you apply the principle of individual dignity and importance to the problems of government, you find that you have constantly a greater respect for the local government, the government that is closer to that individual. On top of that, you have great confidence in the abilities, the initiative and energies of 168 million people to do the job of developing America.', ""Government's function is to provide the climate in which those people can work in confidence and security."", 'And then the next principle that we observed is this: the spirit of our people is the strength of our nation.', 'Strength is not just in arms and guns and planes. It is not just in factories and in fertile farms. It is in the heart--the heart that venerates the heritage we have from our fathers--the heritage of freedom--of self-government. That is the basic strength of America.', 'The next principle is: America does not prosper unless all Americans prosper. And so, while we believe that many groups have special problems, under our principle none has special privileges. Everything is settled on the basis of what is good for all of us--every American man, woman and child, whatever his station, his calling, his religion, or his race.', 'Next, we believe that government must have a heart as well as a head. By this we mean that government must concern itself in pointing the way and leading the way to those great social security programs, to the health of our people--the education of our people--to make certain that all these are available as an average American citizen has a right to expect them.', 'And then we wrote another statement that we call a principle. It was this: Courage and principle, cooperation and practice make freedom a positive thing.', 'I might apply this principle for you to the problem of civil rights. We believe, with the Constitution, in the equality before the law of every single American. In making this a reality in this day and time, we believe in cooperation. We believe that in getting the cooperation that comes about from willing working together of Americans, you achieve much more than you do just by writing a hard and fixed dictum of law and say: everybody must conform.', 'Force is often not the best way to get a thing done, as we have found out in our international affairs. We must secure the cooperation of those people who have the same values in life.', 'Our next principle is this: the purpose of government is to serve--never to dominate. This means that conscience rather than force is the key to action, whether it be something you are contemplating at home or indeed in a conference among heads of state abroad.', 'And then we feel this: to stay free, we must stay strong.', ""And again, I don't mean merely military strength. We must have that economic strength that allows each of us to increase his standard of living, to look out for his children, to see that they are educated, to provide a healthful life where there is ample opportunity for recreation, intellectual advancement, and the development of real spiritual strength."", 'That is the kind of thing we are talking about.', 'And we believe, under God, in the cause of freedom and justice and peace for all peoples.', ""We understand clearly that no single nation in this world may have peace unless all travel that same road. Because peace is something that must be universal or it doesn't exist."", ""Now, I know of no single principle that is more important than this one. Because, my friends, everything that happens abroad these days affects us here at home. We have found this to be especially true lately--our tensions, our anxieties, our concerns for people that are being downtrodden, people that are being ruthlessly exploited, even killed for their love of freedom. That affects us, because, again, we know that just like peace, freedom is indivisible, because it is free people that want to keep the peace. It's people that have to fight wars; therefore, people don't want war. Therefore, any free government is one that can be trusted."", 'So we have a very large stake in the freedom of every people-wherever they may be, just as we do in our own. We do not believe in second-class citizens. And there can be no second-class nations. Before the law all are equal; let us remember that.', 'Now tomorrow is the day that we practice the privilege of free voting. When we stop to think that tonight there are thousands of people ready to risk their lives--actually dying-for this priceless privilege, it seems almost redundant for any of us to have to be reminded that it is a priceless privilege that can be preserved best only through exercising it.', ""If we don't vote, then we are forfeiting one of the great privileges we have, of participating in the decisions of this country."", 'I am not speaking now of how you vote. I am talking about the act itself. To be a free person to exercise that right so that you will be using your best judgment for the benefit of yourselves, your children, your country--the entire future--for the whole world, that is the thing that we must do.', 'So, if I could make one request of all of you this evening, it would be merely this: That when you wake up in the morning, start telephoning any friend that you think may have overlooked the fact that it is election day and that he should vote. Do this even before you go to the polls yourself. And then go there and register your decision.', 'I will tell you one thing: whatever that decision is, the four people in this room--Pat and Dick, and Mamie and I--will accept it not only wholeheartedly, but we will continue to do our best, no matter in what capacity we may be serving, to be true Americans.', 'And no person can aspire to a greater privilege and a greater honor. You have done me a very great courtesy in allowing me to come into your living rooms this evening. I thank you sincerely.', 'God bless each of you--and goodnight.']",1
31,Dwight D. Eisenhower ,"November 07, 1956","['Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice President, my very good friends in this audience and everywhere in the United States to whatever areas my voice reaches:', 'This is a solemn moment. The only thing I should like to say about this campaign is this: It is a very heart-warming experience to know that your labors--your efforts--of four years have achieved that level where they are approved by the United States of America in a vote.', 'Such a vote as that cannot be merely for an individual, it is for principles and ideals for which that individual and his associates have stood and have tried to exemplify.', 'To all the people of the United States who have understood what the Administration--the Republican Party--has been trying to do in these past four years, and consequently have worked so hard for the re-election of that Administration, my most grateful thanks.', 'The only thing I can say to all the people--all the Americans who have voted that ticket which puts us back into the same positions of responsibility--I can only say, it is our earnest prayer that nothing we can ever do or shall ever do--will betray that trust.', 'And now let me say something that looks to the future: I think that modern Republicanism has now proved itself. And America has approved of modern Republicanism.', 'And so, as we look ahead--as we look ahead to the problems in front, let us remember that a political party deserves the approbation of America only as it represents the ideals, the aspirations and the hopes of Americans. If it is anything less, it is merely a conspiracy to seize power. And the Republican Party is not that!', 'Modern Republicanism looks to the future. Which means it looks to that area--that time--in which our young are most interested. And this means that it will gain constantly new recruits from the youngest of our voters. And as such, as long as it remains true to the ideals and the aspirations of America, it will continue to increase in power and influence for decades to come. It will point the way to peace among nations, and to prosperity-advancing standards here at home in which everybody will share, regardless of any accident of birth, of station, of race, religion, or color.', 'And if we cling to these ideals, if we uphold them, if we fight for them, then I say: Republicans deserve, then, the vote of confidence that Republicans, friendly Democrats, and Independents, have given us this day.', 'My friends, I conclude with a pledge: with whatever talents the good God has given me, with whatever strength there is within me, I will continue--and so will my associates--to do just one thing: to work for 168 million Americans here at home-and for peace in the world.']",1
