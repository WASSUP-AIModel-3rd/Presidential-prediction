Johnson ,"August 26, 1964","['Mr. Chairman, my fellow Americans, my fellow Democrats, columnists and commentators:', 'It is wonderful to be here with you tonight, but do we really need all of these lights on?', 'I thank the convention for the honor it has done me. I will be with you tomorrow to begin the march toward an overwhelming victory for our party and for our Nation.', 'Four years ago one of our greatest Americans stood before this Democratic Convention, John F. Kennedy of the State of Massachusetts. We grieved at his loss, but we carried on, and we have fulfilled his program without flinching for one moment.', 'In the last 3 days, the noble Democrats who are delegates to this convention have made a great start toward a great Democratic victory. You have built a platform on which I am proud to stand, a platform built on solid performance and framed for a future of prosperity and peace.', ""In your settlement of the problems of credentials, you have found a fair answer to honest differences among honorable men. You have struck a magnificent keynote through the eloquence of the gifted Senator from Rhode Island, John Pastore. You have reaffirmed our enduring values through your wise and beloved permanent Chairman, Mr. Rayburn's friend and his worthy successor, Speaker John McCormack of the State of Massachusetts."", 'No chairman of any Platform Committee ever guided a committee better or a party better than the Honorable Carl Albert of the State of Oklahoma.', 'Well, I, too, have been working to carry out my obligations under a very old American tradition, for it is the traditional task of your Presidential nominee to recommend for your deliberation a candidate for Vice President of the United States.', 'I have such a recommendation. I have reached it after consultations with the leaders of the Democratic Party in every section of this Nation, and at every level of our Government. I have reached it after discussions with outstanding Americans in every area of our national life. I have reached it after long and prayerful private thought, consulting my own experience of that office, and the burdens that it brings.', 'All of this has had a single guide--to find a man best qualified to assume the office of President of the United States should that day come. I have found such a man.', 'He has been tested and proven in our Democratic process of political campaign and election. He has had long and distinguished experience in public life as an executive and as a legislator. And every step has been marked by excellence and achievement.', 'He knows the problems of all of our people in every part of our Nation. He knows the world and he knows its problems, and he has shown understanding and a deep concern for the strength of our country and for the peace of the world. He matches energy in the right with compassion for the needs of others. He matches strong convictions with understanding of the convictions of others.', 'If you select him, you can proudly say to the American people, ""This is not a sectional choice."" This is not just merely the way to balance the ticket. This is simply the best man in America for this job.', 'The qualities that he brings to office will help make the Vice Presidency an important instrument of the executive branch. From that office he can help connect Congress to the White House, and he can help carry America around the world.', 'I want to say to you that I will feel strengthened knowing that he is at my side at all times in the great work of your country and your Government.', ""Nothing has given me greater support in the past 9 months than my knowledge of President Kennedy's confidence that I could continue the task that he began. I have found a man that I can trust in the same way. This confidence and this recommendation are not mine alone. They represent the enthusiastic conviction of the great majority of the Democratic Party in the United States."", 'They will, I believe--they will, I am sure, receive the overwhelming support of the American people. I hope that you will choose as the next Vice President of the United States my close, my longtime, my trusted colleague, Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota.']",1
1,Lyndon B. Johnson ,"August 27, 1964","['Chairman McCormack, my fellow Americans:', 'I accept your nomination.', 'I accept the duty of leading this party to victory this year.', 'And I thank you, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for placing at my side the man that last night you so wisely selected to be the next Vice President of the United States.', 'I know I speak for each of you and all of you when I say he proved himself tonight in that great acceptance speech. And I speak for both of us when I tell you that from Monday on he is going to be available for such speeches in all 50 States!', 'We will try to lead you as we were led by that great champion of freedom, the man from Independence, Harry S. Truman.', 'But the gladness of this high occasion cannot mask the sorrow which shares our hearts. So let us here tonight, each of us, all of us, rededicate ourselves to keeping burning the golden torch of promise which John Fitzgerald Kennedy set aflame.', 'And let none of us stop to rest until we have written into the law of the land all the suggestions that made up the John Fitzgerald Kennedy program. And then let us continue to supplement that program with the kind of laws that he would have us write.', 'Tonight we offer ourselves--on our record and by our platform--as a party for all Americans, an all-American party for all Americans. This prosperous people, this land of reasonable men, has no place for petty partisanship or peevish prejudice. The needs of all can never be met by parties of the few. The needs of all cannot be met by a business party or a labor party, not by a war party or a peace party, not by a southern party or a northern party.', 'Our deeds will meet our needs only if we are served by a party which serves all our people.', 'We are members together of such a party, the Democratic Party of 1964.', 'We have written a proud record of accomplishments for all Americans.', 'If any ask what we have done, just let them look at what we promised to do. For those promises have become our deeds. And the promises of tonight I can assure you will become the deeds of tomorrow.', 'We are in the midst of the largest and the longest period of peacetime prosperity in our history. And almost every American listening to us tonight has seen the results in his own life.', 'But prosperity for most has not brought prosperity to all. And those who have received the bounty of this land--who sit tonight secure in affluence and safe in power-must not now turn from the needs of their neighbors.', 'Our party and our Nation will continue to extend the hand of compassion and the hand of affection and love to the old and the sick and the hungry. For who among us dares to betray the command: ""Thou shalt open thine hand--unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.""', 'The needs that we seek to fill, the hopes that we seek to realize, are not our needs, our hopes alone. They are the needs and hopes of most of the people.', 'Most Americans want medical care for older citizens. And so do I.', 'Most Americans want fair and stable prices and decent incomes for our farmers. And so do I.', 'Most Americans want a decent home in a decent neighborhood for all. And so do I.', 'Most Americans want an education for every child to the limit of his ability. And so do I.', 'Most Americans want a job for every man who wants to work. And so do I.', 'Most Americans want victory in our war against poverty. And so do I.', 'Most Americans want continually expanding and growing prosperity. And so do I.', 'These are your goals. These are our goals. These are the goals and will be the achievements of the Democratic Party. These are the goals of this great, rich Nation. These are the goals toward which I will lead, if the American people choose to follow.', 'For 30 years, year by year, step by step, vote by vote, men of both parties have built a solid foundation for our present prosperity. Too many have worked too long and too hard to see this threatened now by policies which promise to undo all that we have done together over all these years.', 'I believe most of the men and women in this hall tonight, and I believe most Americans, understand that to reach our goals in our own land, we must work for peace among all lands.', ""America's cause is still the cause of all mankind."", 'Over the last 4 years the world has begun to respond to a simple American belief: the belief that strength and courage and responsibility are the keys to peace.', 'Since 1961, under the leadership of that great President, John F. Kennedy, we have carried out the greatest peacetime buildup of national strength of any nation at any time in the history of the world.', 'I report tonight that we have spent $30 billion more on preparing this Nation in the 4 years of the Kennedy administration than would have been spent if we had followed the appropriations of the last year of the previous administration.', 'I report tonight as President of the United States and as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces on the strength of your country, and I tell you that it is greater than any adversary. I assure you that it is greater than the combined might of all the nations, in all the wars, in all the history of this planet. And I report our superiority is growing.', 'Weapons do not make peace. Men make peace. And peace comes not through strength alone, but through wisdom and patience and restraint.', 'And these qualities under the leadership of President Kennedy brought a treaty banning nuclear tests in the atmosphere. And a hundred other nations in the world joined us.', 'Other agreements were reached and other steps were taken. And their single guide was to lessen the danger to men without increasing the danger to freedom.', 'Their single purpose was peace in the world.', 'And as a result of these policies, the world tonight knows where we stand and our allies know where we stand, too. And our adversaries have learned again that we will never waver in the defense of freedom.', 'The true courage of this nuclear age lies in the quest for peace.', ""There is no place in today's world for weakness. But there is also no place in today's world for recklessness. We cannot act rashly with the nuclear weapons that could destroy us all. The only course is to press with all our mind and all our will to make sure, doubly sure, that these weapons are never really used at all."", 'This is a dangerous and a difficult world in which we live tonight. I promise no easy answers. But I do promise this. I pledge the firmness to defend freedom, the strength to support that firmness, and a constant, patient effort to move the world toward peace instead of war.', 'And here at home one of our greatest responsibilities is to assure fair play for all of our people.', ""Every American has the right to be treated as a 'person. He should be able to find a job. He should be able to educate his children, he should be able to vote in elections and he should be judged on his merits as a person."", 'Well, this is the fixed policy and the fixed determination of the Democratic Party and the United States of America.', 'So long as I am your President I intend to carry out what the Constitution demands--and justice requires--equal justice under law for all Americans.', 'We cannot and we will not allow this great purpose to be endangered by reckless acts of violence. Those who break the law--those who create disorder--whether in the North or the South--must be caught and must be brought to justice.', 'And I believe that every man and woman in this room tonight join me in saying that in every part of this country the law must be respected and violence must be stopped.', 'And wherever a local officer seeks help or Federal law is broken, I have pledged and I will use the full resources of the Federal Government.', 'Let no one tell you that he can hold back progress and at the same time keep the peace. This is a false and empty promise. To stand in the way of orderly progress is to encourage violence.', 'And I say tonight to those who wish us well--and to those who wish us ill--the growing forces in this country are the forces of common human decency, and not the forces of bigotry and fear and smear.', 'Our problems are many and are great. But our opportunities are even greater.', 'And let me make this clear. I ask the American people for a mandate--not to preside over a finished program--not just to keep things going, I ask the American people for a mandate to begin.', ""This Nation--this generation--in this hour, has man's first chance to build the Great Society--a place where the meaning of man's life matches the marvels of man's labor."", 'We seek a nation where every man can find reward in work and satisfaction in the use of his talents. We seek a nation where every man can seek knowledge, and touch beauty, and rejoice in the closeness of family and community.', 'We seek a nation where every man can, in the words of our oldest promise, follow the pursuit of happiness--not just security-but achievements and excellence and fulfillment of the spirit.', 'So let us join together in this great task.', 'Will you join me tonight in rebuilding our cities to make them a decent place for our children to live in?', 'Will you join me tonight in starting a program that will protect the beauty of our land and the air that we breathe?', ""Won't you join me tonight in starting a program that will give every child education of the highest quality that he can take?"", ""So let us join together in giving every American the fullest life which he can hope for. For the ultimate test of our civilization, the ultimate test of our faithfulness to our past, is not in our goods and is not in our guns. It is in the quality--the quality of our people's lives and in the men and women that we produce."", 'This goal can be ours. We have the resources; we have the knowledge. But tonight we must seek the courage.', 'Because tonight the contest is the same that we have faced at every turning point in history. It is not between liberals and conservatives, it is not between party and party, or platform and platform. It is between courage and timidity. It is between those who have vision and those who see what can be, and those who want only to maintain the status quo. It is between those who welcome the future and those who turn away from its promises.', 'This is the true cause of freedom. The man who is hungry, who cannot find work or educate his children, who is bowed by want--that man is not fully free.', 'For more than 30 years, from social security to the war against poverty, we have diligently worked to enlarge the freedom of man. And as a result, Americans tonight are freer to live as they want to live, to. pursue their ambitions, to meet their desires, to raise their families than at any time in all of our glorious history.', 'And every American knows in his heart that this is right.', 'I am determined in all the time that is mine to use all the talents that I have for bringing this great, lovable land, this great Nation of ours, together--together in greater unity in pursuit of this common purpose. I truly believe that we someday will see an America that knows no North or South, no East or West--an America that is undivided by creed or color, and untorn by suspicion or strife.', 'The Founding Fathers dreamed America before it was. The pioneers dreamed of great cities on the wilderness that they crossed.', 'Our tomorrow is on its way. It can be a shape of darkness or it can be a thing of beauty. The choice is ours, it is yours, for it will be the dream that we dare to dream.', 'I know what kind of a dream Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman and John F. Kennedy would dream if they were here tonight.', 'And I think that I know what kind of a dream you want to dream.', 'Tonight we of the Democratic Party confidently go before the people offering answers, not retreat; offering unity, not division; offering hope, not fear or smear.', 'We do offer the people a choice, a choice of continuing on the courageous and the compassionate course that has made this Nation the strongest and the freest and the most prosperous and the most peaceful nation in the history of mankind.', 'To those who have sought to divide us they have only helped to unite us.', 'To those who would provoke us we have turned the other cheek.', 'So as we conclude our labors, let us tomorrow turn to our new task. Let us be on our way!']",1
2,Lyndon B. Johnson ,"August 28, 1964","['Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice President, ladies and gentlemen:', 'All of us are planning to go home--but not Senator Humphrey.', 'All of us are planning to get out and relax a little bit--but not Senator Humphrey!', 'All of us think Hubert Humphrey is the ideal nominee for Vice President. But--I hate to tell you this, Hubert--so does Senator Goldwater, or at least that is what he told the press before your speech last night.', 'I am happy to be permitted to come here and visit with you this morning, particularly to thank you for your service to the Democratic Party. Hubert and I are leaving shortly for a session this weekend, and it is not going to be an organizational one. We came to the Senate back in 1949 together, and he and I have had very little difficulty getting organized.', 'But with your support, and the support of the leading Democrats in every State of the Union, the support of many people who have never before supported the Democratic Party, the American people are going to win one of their finest victories this November.', 'We have two problems that we will deal with when we get back home, and we will deal with nationally from time to time. One is the so-called backlash. That backlash according to the three national pollsters, plus some 15 or 20 State polls that we have, indicates that there will be somewhere between 10 and 15 percent of the Democrats or those who allege to be Democrats or those who have called themselves Democrats at some time or other in their lives who do not plan to vote for the Democratic ticket this year.', 'A smart publicity man has latched onto a--coined a new explanation of that defection that we have come to experience in Democratic conventions and in Democratic elections from time to time, and he calls it backlash.', ""But the plain fact is that in some States you have very little, if any, defection. In other States it runs up to 20 or 30 percent. In certain areas of the South it runs 26 percent. But the average of the Democrats that for one reason or another, because they don't like my accent or that I am too tall or I am too short or they don't like the tax bill or they don't like the Viet-Nam policy or they don't like the civil rights bill, for some of those reasons they plan to vote otherwise. They run from 10 to 15 percent. So, we are going to deal with that problem. We are going to try to get that 10 percent back if we can."", '[At this point there was a commotion in the room.]', 'It seems we still have some of these--some of these fellows who were out in San Francisco have evidently come in here!', 'So much for Democratic defection.', ""Let's welcome them back. Let's do what we can to persuade them of the errors of their ways without being offensive. Let's try to reason with them. Let's give them a little time and hope that by November we can improve on that situation, and while we may not have 100 percent of the Democrats we can have over 90 percent of the Democrats."", ""Now, Mr. Nixon, when he started out to run in 1960, I don't want to use him as an example, but he had 92 percent of the Republicans the day he was nominated."", 'Now, Mr. Roper shows that the present Republican nominee has got 50 percent of the Republicans and Mr. Gallup and Mr. Harris show that ranges from a little above 50 to a little above 60. But the point is he has 2 out of 3, and they have what you would call a frontlash of about 30 percent.', ""Now, for the life of me I can't understand why a fellow who is interrogating or interviewing someone is not just as concerned with the 30 percent frontlash as he is with the 10 percent backlash, and I hope between now and November to discuss frontlash around the country if I can get the cooperation of some of my commentator friends."", 'I talked to one of the publishers late yesterday. I believe he is going to be a part of that frontlash this year. He is going to endorse the Democratic ticket and I said, ""Why don\'t you get your people to inquire about the frontlash because it is 30 percent compared to 10 percent, and it is a lot more serious and it should be of a great deal more concern ?""', 'Now, our problem with the frontlash is to hold that frontlash right where it is. That frontlash is made up of liberal Republicans. Some of them are out organizing independent tickets now, some of them are running on their own. Some of them are divorcing themselves from their candidate, some of them are waiting until he makes some further explanation. Some of them are saying, ""Well, what did you mean last Saturday?""', 'Then we have the so-called moderate Republicans, and there are a good many in that group, and they say for various reasons they are not going to vote Republican this year. We have a good many business people-I understand that Hubert has just had a couple of organizational meetings with them; he has got some others scheduled--but a good many of the business people whose attachment to the Republican Party is well known, are very happy with economic conditions in this country, with the fiscal policy of this Government, with our sound, prudent management of our fiscal affairs, and a goodly number of them have indicated to us and indicated to their associates that they are part of the frontlash.', 'So, whether you take it nationwide, whether you take it in New York or Indiana or Wisconsin or Hawaii, all of those States we have polled, Pennsylvania, you will find this: that for every backlash that the Democrats lose, we pick up 3 frontlash.', 'And when you can get 3 to 1 it is always satisfying.', ""But it is particularly satisfying when you realize that the 1 you are losing, you are losing because they don't want to treat people alike and they don't want to treat all people as Americans. And the ones that we are winning, we are winning because they have confidence in our leadership and confidence in our management and they want peace on earth and good will toward men."", 'We have got a great system in this country. We can worship God according to the dictates of our conscience. We have free speech. We have free press, and we--it never gets quite as free as it does during convention time.', 'I almost put off my physical examination the other day because I watched these commentators and I read these various analytical pieces by some of the ablest men in the country that I had known well for many years. I was afraid my blood pressure would be too high to have an examination at that time.', ""But this has been a happy convention. It has been a historic convention. I heard a few questions asked from time to time that I thought were calculated to provoke a fight, and I saw men almost come to blows a time or two, but thank goodness it really didn't happen."", 'We have had 164 years of the Democratic Party, and I think that it has really come alive this year. Back in 1800 we founded it and that was a year of bitter and extreme partisanship. Our Nation was torn by division, but when the campaign was over, when the dust had settled, when the victory was won, Thomas Jefferson\'s instinct was to heal and not to hate. He went before his countrymen in speaking to them all and he said, ""We are all Democrats. We are all Republicans .""', ""Of course, I am taking a little liberty with the names because there really wasn't a Republican Party then. But the equivalent that did exist, the equivalent to the Republican Party, soon faded away because Americans became tired of their extreme partisanship."", 'Now, comparisons are odious and none is implied although some may be inferred!', 'I deeply believe this, this year: I believe in the year 1964 we are going before the wisest and before the best informed and the most intelligent and the most independent electorate that any candidates ever faced in the history of America. The American families in their homes across the land want and expect and deserve something better of politics and politicians than they have ever been offered before. This convention has affirmed what this Congress and this administration have already made clear, and that is that the Democrats of this day and age are providing this Nation with the kind of leadership that the world requires.', 'Ours is a party that is responsible and is responsive, that is progressive and is prudent. It is a party of vision, and a party of commonsense.', ""It is a party where all expect full hearing, and all receive fair play. We let people talk and we don't boo them when they speak. We do not fear to expose ourselves to their words and we don't contribute to smearing their character."", 'Ours is a party that respects and trusts our electorate, and I think it can be trusted by all Americans of all sections and of all segments. The Nation sees this clearly and the opportunity is yours to build upon the broadest base of our history, to fashion a true national party for national leadership.', 'This fall and in the seasons to come, let us go forth to build a stronger party, to carry on with the work of building a stronger society so that we can have a stronger civilization.', 'The doors of the Democratic Party are and must always be open to all people--to the humble and to the proud, to the weak and to the strong, to those who need help and to those who are willing to give it, and we invite them to enter in and to work with us.', 'We mean to do the work that America needs to have done. We mean to work for unity and we mean to obtain it, but we mean to do much more than that. We mean to work for peace in the world, and peace in the lives of the average American family. We mean to keep our Nation strong and we mean to help each American to rise to his full strength.', ""We are determined that compassion shall not pass from the character of this Nation's soul; that America shall never cease to care, care for the needy and the sick, and care for the young and the old, and to care for the family farmer, and care for the family of the workingman. We aim to conserve the values of America, and to perpetuate the vitality of the American system, and we welcome all who believe in that system."", 'We welcome all from both sides. We welcome the backlash to come back, and the frontlash to come forward.', 'We do not want big government or small government. What we want is good government.', ""We do not want spendthrift government or stingy government. We do want sensible government--saving every place it can but serving every place that it's needed."", 'We who have assembled in this room this morning and those of us who wear the proud honor that you have given us, are inheritors of a very long and very proud trust, from Jefferson to Jackson, from Grover Cleveland to Woodrow Wilson, from Franklin Delano Roosevelt to Harry S. Truman to John Fitzgerald Kennedy.', 'And I always want to conduct myself, and I hope that you will do likewise, just as though they were sitting there on the pedestal watching our every act. And when I walked out of the hall last night I looked up to three great men who had played a great part in some of the years that I had lived and somehow or other I felt good because I felt that they would approve what you had done at this convention.', 'We are not going to be remembered for what we stopped. We are going to be remembered for what we started and what we executed.', 'We are not going to be remembered for where we have been. We are going to be remembered for where we are going.', ""We are not going to turn the clock back and roll the carpet back to the 18th century. We are going forward 'to build a new life."", 'We are going to finish the work that Jack Kennedy left us, but we have a mandate to begin a new program of our own. And it is going to be a program that is prudent but progressive. It is going to be a program that is fashioned for all the people of all parties, but it is not going to be one that is built on the past.', 'Yes, the torch is passed to us, and the responsibility is ours. The burdens of preserving peace and defending freedom are challenges to us and let our glory shine in the hope and health and happiness of every American home because I predict that when the record shall have been written and you return to the next Democratic Convention you can look back upon your work and your endeavors of the last 4 years and point with pride instead of view with alarm.', ""Now, I don't want to be suggestive or arbitrary but I have found that the officers of your committee and those that they have employed and surrounded themselves with have been very cooperative, have been very dedicated to the interests of our party, have brought us to the position this morning of being in the best shape that I have ever known the Democratic Party to be in, in the 30 years that I have been an active participant in the Democratic Party."", 'The first time that I remembered that we ever launched a campaign and nominated two candidates without a single no.', 'The first time that I know that we ever met and started a campaign with a surplus instead of a debt.', ""The first time that I ever have known that you can have a real rumpus in the Credentials Committee and say all the ugly things that were said there for 3 or 4 days and then Dave Lawrence comes out and makes such a persuasive report they don't even have a roll call."", 'One of: my youthful idealistic naive friends raised a question in one of his columns the other day about some of the folks that were running this convention, and they pointed out about the professional experience of the distinguished Speaker, and the fact that the majority leader of the House had been in Congress several years, and the parliamentarian was not a schoolboy. He had been around a few places, and the distinguished chairman of the credentials committee was not without experience.', 'Well, I never wanted or never needed or never was happier to have around me professionals more than I was this week.', 'So, if you will not consider it presumptuous, I see no reason for a change. And I can think of--nothing would do them greater honor or would please me more than to have you elect every officer the same way you nominated your President and your Vice President.', '[After certain intervening proceedings of the Democratic National Committee, the President resumed speaking.]', 'Could I have your attention for just a moment?', 'I was just handed the official backlash-frontlash figures, if any of you are interested in them, from Mr. Roper, Mr. Gallup, and Mr. Harris, the three national pollsters.', 'Mr. Roper shows that 78 percent of the Democrats are still Democrats and 13 percent plan to vote for another candidate, and Mr. Gallup shows that 85 percent to 11, as compared to 78 to 13, and Mr. Harris shows 78 to 22. He gives the undecided to the other side. That is an average of about 15 percent.', 'The Republicans, Mr. Roper shows that 50 percent will vote for their own candidate and 27 percent will vote for the Democratic candidate.', 'So just so you can remember that in case some of these folks inquire about the backlash, the same man says it is 27 percent Republican frontlash to 13 percent Democratic backlash.', 'Come on, get your picture and let me go ahead.', 'The next one is Dr. Gallup. He shows it is 65 to 26, so he shows this 26 percent frontlash to 11 percent backlash. I wonder why that is not as attractive to them as the backlash, the frontlash.', 'Then Mr. Harris shows 33 percent backlash, 67 to 33. So, whatever poll you take, one of them has 27, one has 26, and one has 33 backlash.', 'Voices: Frontlash.', 'THE PRESIDENT. Frontlash, yes. Minnesota, 22 percent Republicans will vote Democratic, California poll, 25 percent of the Republicans vote Democratic, Iowa, 31 percent of the Republicans vote Democratic, New Jersey, 35 percent of the Republicans, and in New York, 37 percent of those who voted for Richard Nixon in 1960 in the poll completed by Oliver Quayle this week say 37 percent of those who voted for Nixon say they will vote for the Democratic ticket this year.', 'Thank you very much.', 'Goodby, and when you go back to your homes I hope you will give our very deep thanks and sincere, genuine appreciation to all the good Democrats that have worked so hard to make possible what happened this week. And I want you to know that if the good Lord will give us strength, that Hubert and I will be as many places as we can between now and next November, and we will give you a margin of victory that will make even the most downcast of you feel real proud.']",1

We have had a long and an exciting week. It is nice to end it here at home among friends that we have known for 56 years. I know that a lot of hard work has gone into this effort that makes this such a pleasant evening for all of us. I want to thank all of you who served on the committee that brought us this barbecue, the fine singing, the good band, the excellent speaker that you will hear a little later, and these distinguished guests.', 'I need not take any of your time to tell you how much this State and this particular area of the State means to me. I do want to take this opportunity to tell you how proud I am of the people that you send to Washington to help us there do the work that needs to be done for you here.', 'I am particularly proud of Congressman Jake Pickle, who serves the 10th District, beginning down here at the Blanco County line, whose district runs almost to Houston. He has been in Congress only a short time, but he has caught on. He knows his way around Washington; he is doing a good job; he is genuinely and sincerely interested in making life better for our people; and he has contributed a great deal to the program that we have passed this year that we think will do just that.', 'Now if I can have a few more words, I want to take this chance to tell you how proud I am and how grateful I am for the steadfast, courageous support that I have received from Senator Yarborough and his wife, Opal Yarborough.', 'You have heard and you have read that Senator Yarborough and I have had differences at times. I have read a good deal more about them and I have heard a good deal more about them than I was ever aware of.', ""But I do want to say this, that I don't think that Texas has had a Senator during my lifetime whose record I am more familiar with than I am with Senator Yarborough's. And I don't think Texas has had a Senator that voted for the people more than Senator Yarborough has voted for them. And no Member of the United States Senate has stood up and fought for me or fought for the people more since I became President than Ralph Yarborough. He is the Democratic nominee of the good Democrats of this State for the 6-year assignment of United States Senator."", 'We have one Republican Senator from Texas already, and I hope that all of you who claim to be Democrats, all of you who pretend to be Democrats, all of you who want to be Democrats, all of you who are really good Americans will go out, come election day, and send to Washington to help Hubert Humphrey and me in the program for all the people of this Nation, Senator Ralph Yarborough.', 'Thank you very much for this nice party. I want to assure you that we are going to have a long and rough campaign. It is not going to be any new adventure for us or any new experience because we have cut our teeth on campaigns for 30 or 40 years around this place. We are not afraid of what we face. We will not indulge in any fear or any smear. We will put the searchlight on and the spotlight out there and we will tell the people what we stand for.', 'In very brief terms, we stand for them. We want prosperity here at home where the laborer is worthy of his hire and where he gets a chance to get decent wages for his work; where the farmer can have stable income, and can enjoy the fruits of this rich land, and educate his children and provide them with clothes and food and some of the luxuries of life; we want a place where business can prosper and earn a fair return on their investment and a fair profit on the capital that they have put into their venture; we want to build a Nation of peace lovers, who do not seek war, but who yearn for peace, but who realize that we cannot build fortress America and put our heads in the sand, and let the rest of the world go by.', 'We do not covet the acreage of anyone else. We seek to dominate no other people. All we try to do is promote peace and harmony in the world, and we like peace so much that we want everybody to have some of it.', ""We don't question the motives of our adversaries; we don't spend the time talking about the people that oppose us. We don't think you are really interested in my personal opinion of the man who may be on the Republican ticket in various places. What you are interested in is what we stand for, what we are going to do about it, how prepared we are to accept the challenge, how experienced we are to render the judgment that will preserve for you the kind of a land that you want to live in."", 'I spent a good many serious evenings studying the problems of this land, and what could confront us the next 4 years. After doing that to the best of my ability, I came to the conclusion that the man and woman on this platform tonight could do more to help us to do what you need to have done for you than anyone else that was available.', ""So I recommended to the Democratic National Convention for their consideration Senator Humphrey. I did this after reviewing the recommendations made by the various Presidents that preceded me for their running mates. I observed that a few Presidents didn't have the privilege of recommending their running mates and, generally speaking, where they didn't they had very poor running mates."", 'So I was glad that after I made my recommendation at the Democratic Convention, made up of more than 2,000 delegates, there wasn\'t one single ""no"" in that hall.', 'I think that is a great tribute to Senator Humphrey and Mrs. Humphrey, and the kind of life they have led.', ""Now we bring you no ready-made answers and we don't know the answers to all the problems we have. We have them in various parts of the world tonight. We have serious problems in Viet-Nam. We have serious problems on the continent of Africa. We have serious problems on the little island of Cyprus that Lady Bird and I visited just a few weeks ago."", 'Any one of those problems can turn into serious events that would bring great shock to our country. We are doing our dead level best to find the solutions to those problems, and we appreciate the support we have from the people of America.', ""I particularly appreciate the faith of my home folks. I can't tell you that every decision I make will be the right one. But I can tell you that when I had to issue the order the other day to send the boys off of that carrier with the bombs in their planes to destroy the nests of those PT boats that had fired on our destroyer, that it was an order that I didn't want to give. It was an act that I realized was a very serious act. But I felt that it was in the best interest of this Nation and it was the only course I could follow if I really wanted peace, to let them know that we meant what we said and said what we meant, and we were prepared to back it up. And we did that."", 'We didn\'t bomb any cities. As a matter of fact, we carefully refrained from doing that. We didn\'t kill any women and children. We didn\'t invade any metropolitan areas. We didn\'t provoke any great nations. We said to them, ""You must leave your neighbors alone and you mustn\'t ever shoot at United States destroyers without expecting a reply.""', 'I get a lot of advice and I need a lot, and I seek it all the time. I am very happy that the men on this platform with me tonight are the kind of men that I can counsel with and I can trust. I have had advice to load our planes with bombs and to drop them on certain areas that I think would enlarge the war and escalate the war, and result in our committing a good many American boys to fighting a war that I think ought to be fought by the boys of Asia to help protect their own land.', 'And for that reason, I haven\'t chosen to enlarge the war. Nor have I chosen to retreat and turn it over to the Communists. Those are two alternatives that we have to face up to. The third alternative is neutralization in Viet-Nam. We have said that if anyone was willing to come forward and guarantee neutralization, in other words guarantee the independence of these free people and guarantee them security from their neighbors who are trying to envelop them, we would be the first to stand up to the table and say to them, ""Show us that you can guarantee their independence and we will salute you and we will be very proud of you.""', 'But there is no country that is willing to do that, that we know of, so neutralization is not very practical at this stage of the game. There are three alternatives we considered.', 'The fourth alternative is to do what we are doing, to furnish advice, give counsel, express good judgment, give them trained counselors, and help them with equipment to help themselves. We are doing that. We have lost less than 200 men in the last several years, but to each one of those 200 men--and we lose about that many in Texas in accidents on the 4th of July--to each one of those 200 men who have given their life to preserve freedom, it is a war and a big war and we recognize it.', 'But we think that it is better to lose 200 than to lose 200,000. For that reason we have tried very carefully to restrain ourselves and not to enlarge the war. We have had a good many difficulties that could have sprung into major events. We had four of our soldiers killed in Panama, and some of our people thought I ought to send in paratroopers, and that we ought to launch a strong force against the small group of folks that live in Panama.', ""But we told them that they couldn't behave this way, and that they would have to sit down and reason with us across the table, that we could not make any precommitments and we wouldn't sign a blank check to a treaty that we didn't know what was in it, but that we would do what was fair, what was right, and what was just."", 'It took us 60 days to work out an agreement with them, but they finally came to us and said, ""We think that is fair enough,"" and so we worked out an agreement. Now we have rather peaceful relations and we are on the way to making amendments and modifications in the arrangements between the two nations that will be satisfactory.', 'Mr. Castro sought to cut our water off at Guantanamo. He notified us in a hasty moment in his own impulsive way that he would not supply water to our base. I had some military experts, some generals here and there, that hollered at me right loudly and said, ""Please send in the Marines immediately.""', ""I didn't see any reason to send in the Marines to cut the water off. I just sent in one admiral to turn it off and kept the Marines at home. I didn't start any war, although I would like very much to see the free people of Cuba be able to govern themselves without the dictations of Mr. Castro."", 'We are going to do everything that we consistently can in our policies to see that the people of Cuba are free people, and can govern themselves. But I would remind you that Mr. Castro came to power before Mr. Kennedy came to power. He came to power in 1959. All these people that give you solutions to Cuba today--ask them where they were in 1959.', 'So we have had in Viet-Nam in less than a year, three different governments. That is pretty difficult, to carry on the resistance that must be carried on when you are changing governments very often. As a matter of fact, I know how difficult it is to change governments at all, because notwithstanding the experience that we had, the transition following the tragedy in Dallas has been a very difficult one that required the cooperation of all good people, Republicans, Democrats, and independents for the last 8 months.', ""We just had two governments in the United States. I hope we don't have another one in November. But we do have some of our people, a rather hard core people, they make up a rather small minority, I think, of our total population."", 'But some of them are frustrated, some of them are over-alarmed, some of them have their blood pressure worked up, some of them are excited and think our country is not doing at all well, and everything is being mismanaged, and we have a lot of woes and a lot of troubles and a lot of headaches that we could do without.', 'Well, we do have troubles and we do have problems, any great nation has them. When you are the leader of the world, when you are the richest nation in the world, when you are the most prosperous people in the world, you do have difficulties.', ""I don't know of any people anywhere that don't look up to the United States of America and really wish that they had some of the things that we have. In all of the travels of more than 40 countries that I have had, I have had impressed upon me the great faith that the people have in our system of government and in our fairness and our justice as people. And most of them like what we have so well they would like to have a little of it themselves."", 'So I say to you tonight, engage in a little introspection, and ask your wife when you go home, ask your children, talk to your family about it, and see just what country you would like to live in that you think is better than this one.', 'Try to figure out what people you think have as high a standard of living as you have. Try to figure out the group of citizens anywhere that enjoys the freedom that you enjoy here in America.', 'Think about how your ancestors came across the water in risky, dangerous adventure, seeking the liberty that you now enjoy. Ask yourself what you are really doing to preserve that liberty, and to be worthy of that liberty, and to justify that liberty and that freedom.', 'All I can say to you is that I have talked much longer than I intended to, but I am proud of the opportunity that you have given me to try to wrestle with your safety and your security, and your future, and the future of the little ones that are here in the front row. I accepted that challenge when I accepted that nomination.', 'As long as the Good Lord gives me life, I am going to do my dead level best with all the energy I have, and with any talent that I may have, and with any experience and any judgment that I may have, to leave this world better than I found it. And to leave it prepared always to defend itself; to leave it willing always to meet any neighbor halfway and do him justice; leave it a prosperous Nation, where every child has an opportunity to get an education, where every man has an opportunity to get a job, where every family can worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience, and where we have the right of free speech and we do not discriminate against our own people, and that we try to make this one happy family made up of 200 million people in this country that can be an example for all the rest of the world to follow.', 'Thank you and good night.']",1
4,Lyndon B. Johnson ,"September 07, 1964","['Mr. Barbour, Governor and Mrs. Romney, Mayor Cavanagh, Senator Hart, Senator McNamara, Congressman Staebler, Walter Reuther, Governor Swainson, Secretary Williams, my good friends in the Michigan congressional delegation, my fellow countrymen:', 'This is a great day in a historic place. Here, and today, we begin to move toward new years of achievement for America.', 'Sixteen years ago an American President came here and he promised that America would ""enter a new period of hope."" That President was Harry S. Truman.', 'You gave him support and he gave you that hope. Four years ago another great American stood where I stand today and he said, ""Give me your hand... and this country can move again."" That man was John Fitzgerald Kennedy.', 'You reached out your hand, and America began to move.', 'I have come here today to pledge that if all Americans will stand united we will keep moving. This country is not going to turn its back on the future. This country is not going to turn away from the upward course of prosperity or from the urgent hopes of peace.', 'This country is not going to turn away from the needs of the jobless and the hungry, the poor and the oppressed. This country is not going to turn from unity to hostility, from understanding to hate.', 'So today I have come here in Cadillac Square to call for national unity. I plead for brotherhood among men and understanding among nations. This is not just a slogan. It is not based on empty hopes or upon remote dreams. It flows from the facts of life in 1964.', 'I have traveled to every section of this country. I have talked to people in every walk of life. And I have found that most of the American people are united.', 'There are, of course, issues which stir passion and conflicting interests. But most Americans have the same hopes for themselves and their children. They have the same desires for themselves and their country. They know that, for the most part, we no longer struggle among ourselves for a larger share of limited abundance. We labor, instead, to increase the total abundance of us all.', 'Responsible business knows that fair wages are essential to its prosperity. Responsible labor knows that fair profits are essential to rising employment. Farmers and city dwellers, bankers and laborers know that by strengthening each group we strengthen the Nation--by pursuing the growth of all, we advance the welfare of each.', 'And all of us know that we have a mortal stake in the peace of this world. And that the only real test, the only test that really counts, is what is good for America. And what is good for America is good for all of us.', 'I want to talk briefly today about three of the goals which are good for America, which reflect the common purpose of most Americans, which are the basis of unity in our country. These are the goal of prosperity, the goal of justice, and the goal of peace.', 'First, the goal of prosperity. This is the 43d month of the greatest peacetime prosperity in the history of all the United States.', 'The last 4 years, in Michigan alone, unemployment dropped from 10.2 percent to 5.3 percent, the average weekly earnings for manufacturing workers went up 23 percent, a new tax cut will raise personal income by $1 1/2 billion and create 90,000 new jobs.', 'And what is true for Michigan is true for other parts of America. As long as I am President, I will lead this country toward increased prosperity. We will continue until every man has a job, and until every family has a decent income. And this is what most Americans want.', 'The second part of our common purpose is justice. Justice is a country where every man has an equal chance to use his talents, to pursue his desires, and to provide for his family.', 'We seek to give every American, of every race and color, and without regard to how he spells his name, his full constitutional rights under our Constitution and under the law of the land. We seek to conquer the conditions which condemn millions to hopeless poverty.', 'We seek to find a job for every man who wants to work. We seek to care for the old through medical care under social security, the jobless with increased unemployment compensation, the oppressed with minimum wage protection. And this is what we think most Americans want.', 'Third among our common goals is peace. Peace is more than the absence of aggression. It is the creation of a world community in which every nation can follow its own course without fear of its neighbors. In that pursuit we have developed a threefold policy.', 'First, we have built a military strength greater than the world has ever known before.', 'Second, in Cuba and in the waters around Viet-Nam we proved that we would stand firm in the defense of freedom. And everywhere we have worked to extend the domain of liberty.', 'Third, we patiently labored to open new avenues to peace.', 'The result of these efforts since 1961 is our world of 1964. In this world in which we live today, no nation, new or old, has gone Communist since Cuba went in 1959.', ""In this world the solid unity of communism has begun to crack. We have worked to help the nations of Eastern Europe move toward independence. This is their people's goal and this is our people's continuing resolve."", 'In this world the influence and the prestige of freedom is on the rise. Hands of friendship have replaced the clenched fists of angry mobs. In this world the strength of freedom is greater and the prospects for peace are brighter.', 'It is not enough, I think, just to want peace or to talk peace or to hope for peace. We must constantly work for peace. And I want you to know that today your Government is working for peace.', 'We must heed the command to ""follow after the things that make for peace.""', '--That is why I, as a Congressman, worked to help pass the Marshall plan.', ""--That is why, as a Senator during the Eisenhower administration, I went to the United Nations, at President Eisenhower's request, to urge and to invite all nations of the world to join the United States in the peaceful exploration of outer space."", '--And that is why, as Vice President of the United States, I worked long and hard for the treaty banning nuclear tests in the atmosphere. We slowed down the deadly poisoning of the air we breathe, and the milk that our children drink. We do not want every mother to live in fear that her baby may be born crippled or deformed.', '--And we, too, must remember that we organized the Peace Corps which started the spirit of America and carried it to remote villages on every continent of the world.', '--And also that is why, as President, I ordered a cutback of unnecessary nuclear production.', '--And that is why I will continue to support every realistic measure that will bring the world closer to peace without increasing the danger to freedom.', 'Yes, it is men that make peace.', 'Modern weapons are not like any other. In the first nuclear exchange, 100 million Americans and more than 100 million Russians would all be dead. And when it was over, our great cities would be in ashes, our fields would be barren, our industry would be destroyed, and our American dreams would have vanished.', 'As long as I am President I will bend every effort to make sure that that day never comes. I am not the first President to speak here in Cadillac Square, and I do not intend to be the last.', 'Make no mistake. There is no such thing as a conventional nuclear weapon.', 'For 19 peril-filled years no nation has loosed the atom against another. To do so now is a political decision of the highest order. And it would lead us down an uncertain path of blows and counterblows whose outcome none may know. No President of the United States of America can divest himself of the responsibility for such a decision.', 'Any man who shares control of such enormous power must remember that ""He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit is better than he that taketh a city.""', 'These common purposes--prosperity, justice, and peace--are the foundation of American unity.', 'Our future is almost upon us. Man has never lived in a more exciting time. The world is changing before our eyes. Either we will move to meet these changes or they will overwhelm us. On the one hand is opportunity of shining promise; on the other is a power to destroy the world. Those nations or individuals who seek today to divide us, who preach strife and dissension, and hate and fear, and smear, strike at our hopes and strike at the hopes of all the people of the world.', 'When I was young, I often walked out after supper and looked up at the scattered Texas sky. As a boy, on those still nights, I wondered what those heavens had seen, what they would see, and what they might bring to me.', ""The world has turned many times since then, but still in the evening I sometimes walk out and look across the great Capital City where I live, and I dream the same dreams, and I ask the same questions. Just as you do, I sit and think of today's events and tomorrow's problems. I feel glad in my family and concern for my children."", 'It is then that I remember the men who captured my native soil from the wilderness. They endured much so that others might have much. Their dream was for the children; mine, too, is for the child, even now struggling toward birth. What will the observing skies say of the world that we have built for him?', 'I want all the ages of man to yield him their promise, the child will find all knowledge open to him; the growing boy will shape his spirit in a house of God and his ways in the house of his family. The young man will find reward for his work and fed pride in the product of his skills.', 'The man will find leisure and occasion for the closeness of family, and an opportunity for the enrichment of life. The citizen will enrich the Nation, sharing its rule, walking its streets, adding his views to its counsel, secure always from the unjust and the arbitrary power of his fellows.', 'The least among us will find contentment, and the best among us will find greatness, and all of us will respect the dignity of the one and admire the achievements of the other.', 'At the end of the journey, he will look back and say, ""I have done all that a man could do, built all, shared all, experienced all."" And then people shall say to people, group to group, man to man, ""There on this earth as in the eyes of God walks my brother.""', 'Well, this is my dream. It is not the grand vision of a powerful and feared nation. It concerns the simple wants of people. But this is what America is really all about. All the rest, the power and the wealth, the life of freedom and the hopes for peace, the treasured past and the uncertain future--all of this will stand or fall on this. Reality rarely matches dream, but only dreams give nobility to purpose.', 'This is the star that I hope to follow. This is the star which I know that most of you at some time have seen, and which I first glimpsed many, many years ago, one night out in the West.', ""United we stand; divided we fall. So today I say to these thousands assembled here, whose only concern is what is best for their country, let us bring the capitalist, the manager, the worker, and the Government to one table to share in the fruits of all of our dreams and all of our work. And let's leave for our children, as we enjoy for ourselves, the greatest country that any man has ever known.""]",1

When your founders met then, they were forced to meet in secrecy and in fear. Labor had no rights, and few rewards. The laboringman and his family sat at the second table in our society. That day is gone, gone forevermore.', ""The America of 1964 is vastly different from the America of 1888. Sixty-hour weeks are gone. Twenty cents an hour wages are gone. Child labor and sweatshops are gone. You meet as free men ought to meet--out in the open and unafraid, your rights assured, your rewards increased, and your place secure at the first table of our Nation's success."", 'I am proud for you and for your president, Al Hayes. When he retires in a few months, AI Hayes can know that he spent his life participating in the greatest advance made by labor anywhere in all the history of mankind.', 'Now, that is the challenge that is before us. When our work is done, will we know that we, too, have advanced the cause of man? For my part, I am determined that the answer shall be ""yes."" I am determined that history shall rejoice in memory of our generation.', ""I am determined that generations to come after us shall shed no tears, or shame, or sorrow when they remember our stewardship as keepers of the flame. And that is why I come today to call you, and to call all Americans, to the works that I believe we must do, that these shall be remembered as America's proudest years."", 'Our trust today is very great, yours and mine. Our success, the success of all the American people, is running at the flood. In all our years, never have any other Americans known the prosperity that you know today. Old records are being surpassed every month. The August reports have just come in. I read them last night. They show this: More men and women were on nonfarm payrolls last month than ever in American history--59,250,000, up by 1,600,000 more than a year ago.', 'Factory employment reached the highest August level in more than 10 years--17,500,000--300,000 more than a year ago. The factory workweek reached the highest August average since 195--14 years ago--40.9 hours, and the average premium pay of 3.5 hours was the highest since statistical records began back there in 1956.', 'Average weekly earnings set a new record for August of $103--$4.50 more than August 1963, and $10 a week more than August 1961. This is what our late, beloved President, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, talked about when he said, ""We are going to get America moving again.""', 'In these last 3 1/2 years, 3,743,000 new jobs have been added. We have been adding them at the rate of nearly 90,000 new jobs per month. In the previous 3 ½-year period, 1,596,000 jobs were added, a little less than 40,000 jobs per month. We are doing twice as well on new jobs. And on the rise in take-home dollars for the workingman we are doing 7 times better.', ""In the 42 months before January 1961, workers' average weekly earnings, after taxes, rose only $1 .25. But in the next 42 months they rose $8.43--let me repeat, 7 times as much. And that is adjusted to take account of price changes. For all sectors of our economy the story is the same. Whether we look through the eyes of labor or business, white collar or blue collar, farmer or professional, these are years of great success for all Americans. And we appreciate it. That success is our trust, yours and mine."", 'Entrusted to your care, and mine, is both the greatest success any system has ever achieved and the greatest cause that any people have ever borne. We must not lose that success or fail that cause. And I predict here today that we shall not.', 'If future generations are to rejoice in their memory of our generation, our great work must be that great word on the banners in this hall--we must work together all the way for ""unity"" of the American people and the American Nation; all the way this year and every year, because unity is our challenge.', 'This year, and every year, the prosperity of the many must not be sacrificed to the partisanship of the few. This year, and every year, the progress of all the people must not be victimized by the prejudices of any of the people.', ""These are first and basic works of unity.

I know that we can live as we live now--prosperous, progressive, and unafraid--so long as we live together united, forward-looking, and undivided.', 'There is far too much work for Americans to do together in the future for Americans to divide today over the past. Too many Americans who want jobs still cannot find jobs. Too many of our families are too poor. Too many of our young people must end their educations too soon. Too many of our older couples must dip too deeply into their life savings to pay their hospital bills. And that is why we are working so hard, so long, to try to pass medical care under social security in this session.', 'And I say to you now, and I say to all Americans everywhere, if you believe in medical care for the aged under social security, now is the time to stand up and be counted.', 'Yes, we have much work to do in America--in our cities, in our countrysides, and in our classrooms. We are working less hours per day, less days per week, so we have more time to enjoy some of the fruits of American life, and some of the recreation that should be available to every American family.

Of all the ages that men have lived, this age of America is the best of all. This is the real truth about America now, and you know it.', 'But others must know this and others must understand it. That is why I have come to California to speak to you as I do today. I want my voice to be heard around the world, for I speak not for myself, but for the people I serve: the strong, the sensible, the moral, the decent, and the peaceful people of the United States.', 'In this century, time and time again, other men in other lands have misled themselves about what they have heard or what they have read from our land in national election years. From Hitler in 1940 to Castro in 1962, grave miscalculations have been made about America at election time. Our seasons of debate have been miscalculated as seasons of distraction and diversion and division.', 'There must be no such miscalculation in 1964.', ""To those who look to us in trust, to all who wish us well, and to any who wish us ill, I say this today: Do not misjudge America's readiness or America's will. Do not miscalculate the unity of all the American people."", ""Our Nation, conceived in independence and brought forth in unity, has not now come to a time of disunity, or division, or diversion. Through all our years America's cause has been the cause of all of mankind, and this is our cause still. Our purpose is to live in freedom in a world of peace-and that American purpose will never change."", 'But this generation of Americans, blooded in battle, matured in peril, living in times when life was never better, but never in graver danger, we know that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.', 'We know, as Tom Paine put it, ""those who would reap the benefits of liberty must bear like men the hardships of defending it."" This we are doing, and this we shall always do.', ""Here in California I do not need to recite the facts of America's strength and power, for you are the real builders of that strength. We are strong; we are the strongest nation on the earth. Our allies trust that strength. Our adversaries must respect it. Men of all lands can have faith in its wise use."", 'But the condition of our strength is never static. As dangers change, our strength must change, and we are matching new dangers with sure reply.', 'Seven years ago America awakened one morning to find a Soviet satellite orbiting the skies. We found that our adversaries had acquired new capabilities for the use, or the misuse, of space.', 'This administration moved to meet that challenge. We sought and we supported a resolution unanimously approved in the United Nations banning the use of weapons of mass destruction in outer space. We have stated that we have no intention of putting warheads into orbit. We have no reason to believe that any nation now plans to put nuclear warheads into orbit. We have more effective systems today.', 'At the same time, we recognize the danger that an aggressor might some day use armed satellites to try to terrorize the entire population of the world, and we have acted to meet that threat. To insure that no nation will be tempted to use the reaches of space as a platform for weapons of mass destruction, we began in 1962 and 1963 to develop systems capable of destroying bomb-carrying satellites.', 'We have now developed and tested two systems with the ability to intercept and destroy armed satellites circling the earth in space. I can tell you today that these systems are in place, that these systems are operationally ready, that these systems are on alert to protect this Nation and to protect the free world.', 'Our only purpose still is peace, but should another nation employ such weapons in space, the United States will be prepared and will be ready to reply. But this is not the only new development. We are constantly seeking means of protecting this Nation and our allies.', 'Today I am able to tell you, and I am able to say to the entire world, we have a major increase in our capacity to detect hostile launches against the free world.', 'Previously, our radar capability had been limited to the detection of objects within the line of sight, but now we have produced, and we are installing, our first facilities for operational ""over-the-horizon"" radar. This radar will literally look around the curve of the earth, alerting us to aircraft, and especially to missiles, within seconds after they are launched.', 'This capability will give us earlier warning than ever before of any hostile launches against this country. This means more time to prepare for our retaliatory strike and more time for us to decide, to decide with prudence and reason, the scope and the extent of our retaliatory strike. This is another advance in our vigil of peace to fulfill our responsibility as the sentry of security for all the free world.', 'Let me also say this for the people of this Nation to all, also, who may listen in the world: Long ago, a great American patriot said to his countrymen, ""We have one country, one Constitution, and one destiny."" So let all understand that this is America today. We are not a nation divided, or dividing, or divisible. Our will and our work today is that the meaning of our country and our Constitution, and our destiny, shall be the same for all Americans, regardless of their creed or their color or their origins.', 'What men are in America is not determined by their pedigree or their purse but by their soul and spirit and by their Godgiven worth. Others have in times past believed that abundance and comfort and contentment would make Americans flabby and soft and weak. I know this generation of Americans is lean and strong and wise.', 'As we have no delusions about the dangers of the world, we have no illusions about our challenges here at home. We know that we have problems to meet; and we know that we shall meet those challenges.', 'Our abundance will not produce arrogance, success will not turn us into suspicion of one another, we will never trade the pursuit of happiness for the persecutions of hate. If we have new prosperity in our pockets, we carry priceless values in our hearts.', 'Our fathers followed the sun westward to open a continent.', 'Today we guide our course by the star of the Constitution that our forefathers fixed for us as we go forth to open the new age of civilization in America.', 'Others searched for gold. We search and we seek after far more precious values. We seek peace and justice and decency for all mankind everywhere.', 'Our arms shall be always ready, but our hand shall be always extended to those who will join us in a pursuit of peace with honor.', 'We live in a glorious time in a wonderful land. We have much to be thankful for. We can count our blessings, and they are many. We have much to protect and to preserve and to perpetuate.', 'You are the leading State in the leading nation in the world. You have produced leaders worthy of your people, and today California stands out in front as no other State in this Nation stands. So let us realize that we are trustees and we are guardians of all that is good, and let us try to be worthy of this land of ours. Let us try to build this State and build this nation as a nation of lovers instead of a nation of haters.', 'Let us direct and guide our conduct by the Golden Rule of doing unto others as you would have them do unto you.', 'Let us try to join in a cooperative effort, not a dividing one, to see that our resources are conserved, that we have the water that we need to live in happiness, that we have the roads that we need to travel over, that we have a transportation system that will bring us to work and to our pleasures, that we have a roof over the homes of all of our children, that we have a school for them to attend and a teacher awaiting there to meet them that is competent to lead them.', 'And then let us see that we not only have this in the great State of California, but we have it in the union of the Nation.', 'Oh, what you have done to lead the way in the field of education is an inspiration to all of us who come here. So keep up your leadership. Go on your forward march in this great work until the day comes when all have homes, when all children are taught all they can absorb, when we have recreation to take care of our leisure time, and when brother loves brother and neighbor embraces neighbor.', 'Thank you, goodby, and God bless you.']",1
7,Lyndon B. Johnson ,"September 17, 1964","['Senator Morse--when you are traveling with Wayne, you are always in for a surprise--I wish he had made speeches that short in the Senate--and I might say that good--thank you very much.', 'Senator Morse, Senator Neuberger, Congresswoman Green, distinguished Members of the Congress, Mayor, Governor, friends in Portland:', 'This is a very nice thing for you to do so early in the morning--on a rainy morning. I know it took a lot of arranging and a great deal of trouble, and very unusual hospitality. I realize that it is your way of showing your respect for the great office I hold, and for the President of this country.', 'I would like for all the people in the Northwest Public Power Association and the Northwest Electric Light and Power Association to know that I feel a very special debt of gratitude to you for the time you spent, the money you invested, the wonderful public event that you have helped to bring about.', 'This is a rather discouraging occasion, however. I think of all the effort it took to turn off a few lights in the White House in Washington, and here you all finally settled your differences and you are turning on millions all over the country every day.', 'In 1844 a fiery young orator warned, ""Make way for the young American buffalo. We will give him Oregon for his summer shade and the region of Texas for his winter pasture."" Well, it is wonderful to be here in Oregon with you this morning. But I want it distinctly understood I am not ready for any Texas pasture.', 'Yesterday in a few hours I swept across a continent that it took decades of daring to conquer. It took brave men and strong men to make that crossing. But, most of all, it took men of faith--men of great faith in themselves, in their country, in the future of this land.', 'So today we inhabit a continent that is made fertile by that act of faith. Napoleon truly said when he sold Louisiana, ""This accession of territory consolidates the power of the United States forever.""', 'But it was not territory that made us great. It was men. Our West is not just a place. The West is an idea. The Bible says, ""Speak to the earth and it shall teach thee."" And here, in the West, we learned man\'s possibilities were as spacious as the sky that covered him. We learned that free men could build a civilization as majestic as the mountains and the rivers that nourished him. We learned that with our hands we could create a life that was worthy of the land that was ours.', 'And that lesson has illuminated the life of all America--east, west, north, and south.', 'This gathering this morning I think is further proof of that. Your work is a more powerful instrument of freedom than a thousand shouted threats and warnings. In far-off countries, men will look here and learn again that the path of free men is the surest path to progress.', 'Here, in the Northwest, America is moving again. And all the world knows it. This intertie which is the result of so many brains and so much work, and such great efforts, is the most exciting transmission system in history. It will make us world leaders in direct current transmission. It will carry from the Peace River to the Mexican border enough power for five San Franciscos.', 'So I come here to tell you, and to tell each of you, that all America is proud of all of you.', 'I am glad to see this cooperation of private power with public power. The public power yardstick is essential. Private power will always play a substantial and a vital role in the future of this great land. This system is also proof of the power of cooperation and unity. You have proved that if we turn away from division, if we just ignore dissension and distrust, there is no limit to our achievements.', 'I am going to interpolate for a moment here to tell you of an experience I had as a young man trying to reconcile the views of the leaders of public and private power in my State.', 'We had the great man who happened to be a spokesman for Electric Bond and Share, who was president of one of our great power companies, and he looked just like a Methodist deacon. He sat back and was dignified, a very attractive man, a very pure individual, very cautious in what he said.', 'I negotiated with him for 3 days and I never made a dent in his armor. He was looking after those stockholders and he almost looked at me with what I thought was contempt.', 'Finally I got up in my youthful enthusiasm and some impulsiveness that I am very much against these days, and I said, ""So far as I am concerned, you can take a running jump and go straight you know where."" The old gentleman didn\'t get the slightest bit rattled. He just looked back and smiled and said, ""I am sorry you feel that way, young man. We have to do these things as we see them. We are men of convictions and we have to carry out our views and the views of our stockholders as we think we ought to."" All of my REA and public power people applauded me and said it was a great speech. I started out of the room and they all stood.', 'As I walked out the door, I saw an old man there that was the general counsel for the water district. He was an ex-Senator. I ;aid, ""Senator, how did you like my speech?"" He said, ""Come by the office and I would like to talk to you about it."" I said, ""Oh, oh."" So I went by and he said, ""You are in public life. You are a young man just starting out and I want to see you move along and do well. But,"" he said, ""the first thing you have to learn, son, is to tell a man to go to hell and to make him go are two different propositions.""', 'He said, ""Mr. Carpenter doesn\'t want to go. This is a free country and he is going to stay around here, and he thinks it is pretty hot down there, and he doesn\'t elect to take your choice."" He said, ""It took me 2 months to get this group together and you bust it up in 2 minutes. I will have to work now until we can get together again and follow the advice of the prophet Isaiah, \'Come now, let us reason together.\'""', 'Many, many times in the Senate and in the other places of responsibility where I have served I have harkened back to that day in that little courtroom when I expressed my views on the president of the power company. A lot of times I wanted to get up and tell Bob Taft what I thought about his viewpoint and where he ought to go, or Bill Knowland, or Everett Dirksen, or even some of my Democratic friends, from time to time.', 'But I never could forget what that old, wise general counsel said to me, ""Tell them to go and make them go are two different propositions.""', 'I do want you to know, though, that by your reasoning together, by your cooperating together for the benefit of all, I think that is true conservation. This is the kind of conservation action that your Government is going to continue to provide the leadership for.', 'I grew up on the land. The life of my parents depended entirely upon the bounty of the soil. I devoted much of my public life to protecting for our children the great legacy of our natural abundance.', 'So I come to report to you that we have not just talked about progress in this field. We have made progress, and we are at the close of the greatest conservation Congress in the history of the United States of America.', 'The 88th Congress has passed more than 30 important conservation bills.', 'A new Land and Water Conservation Fund will help the States and the cities set aside spots of beauty for recreation and pleasure.', 'A Wilderness Act will guarantee all Americans the natural magnificence which has been your heritage.', 'Water Research and Water Planning bills will speed the development for the soaring water needs of this great, growing Nation.', ""We established continental America's first new national park in 17 years, 23 new national park areas, 4 new national seashores, and a national riverway."", 'We began a new Bureau of Outdoor Recreation so that our children will have a place to hunt and to fish, and to glory in nature.', 'We began the construction of over 200 water resource projects with 70 more scheduled for 1965.', 'We built or we began more than 5,500 miles of transmission lines in this great land.', 'Flood control funds were increased by more than 50 percent.', 'All this we have done, and more. And I pledge you that my administration is going to continue with this progress.', 'But we must do more than continue. Our problems are changing every day and we must change to meet them.', 'Three changing forces are bringing a new era to conservation.', 'The first is growing population. By the year 2000, more than 300 million Americans will need 10 times the power and 2 1/2 times the water that we now consume. Increasing pressures will take our resources, and increasing leisure will tax our recreation.', 'The second is the triumph of technology. The bright success of science also has had a darker side. The waste products of our progress, from exhaust fumes to radiation, may be one of the deadliest threats to the destruction of nature that we have ever known.', ""The third force is urbanization. More of our people are crowding into cities and cutting themselves off from nature. Access to beauty is denied and ancient values are destroyed. Conservation must move from nature's wilderness to the manmade wilderness of our cities. All of this requires a new conservation."", 'We must not only protect from destruction, but we have the job of restoring what has already been destroyed--not only develop old resources, but create new ones-not only save the countryside but, yes, finally salvage the cities.', ""It is not just the classic conservation of protection and development, but it is a creative conservation of restoration and innovation. Its concern is not with nature alone, but with the total relation between man and the world around him. Its object is not just man's welfare, but the dignity of his spirit."", 'Above all, we must maintain the chance for contact with beauty. When that chance dies, a light dies in all of us. Thoreau said, ""A town is saved not more by the righteous men in it than by the woods--that surround it."" And Emerson taught, ""There is no police so effective as a good hill and wide pasture."" We are the creation of our environment. If it becomes filthy and sordid, then the dignity of the spirit and the deepest of our values immediately are in danger.', 'In the development of a new conservation I intend to press ahead on five fronts:', 'First, we seek to guarantee our children a place to walk and play and commune with nature. The demand on our recreational facilities is doubling each decade. We must act boldly or our future will be barren.', 'We will move vigorously under our recent laws to acquire and to develop new areas for recreation in this country--emphasizing areas of concentrated population. And we will be ready to expand our programs to meet the developing needs.', 'A national program of scenic parkways and scenic riverways is on the horizon. I hope, for instance, to make the Potomac a conservation model for our metropolitan areas.', 'In our cities, open space must be reserved where possible, and created where preservation comes too late.', 'Second, we must control the waste products of technology. The air we breathe, the water we drink, our soil, our wildlife are all being blighted by the poisons and the chemicals, and all the inevitable waste products of modern life.', 'The skeleton of discarded cars, old junk yards, litter our countryside--and are driving my wife mad. She thinks that one of the advantages of getting defeated is to give her some time to get out and do something about cleaning up the countryside and these old junkyards along our beautiful driveways.', 'I intend to work with local government and industry to develop a national policy for the control and disposal of technological and industrial waste. I will work with them to carry out that kind of a policy. Only in this way, I think, can we rescue the oldest of our treasures from the newest of our enemies.', 'Third, we must increase mastery over our environment through the marvels of new technology. This means rapidly increasing emphasis on comprehensive river basin development. So we plan to cooperate at every level to develop the resources and to preserve the values of entire regions of this land.', 'It means drawing fresh water from the oceans. Within a few years economic desalinization will be a reality for a large number of Americans.', 'It means learning to understand the weather and to do something about it. The advance notice that we got on Hurricane Carla saved us thousands of lives and millions of dollars.', 'It means the use in every field of the newest knowledge to meet the oldest needs. It means encouraging the development of the genius of man in order to unlock the secrets of the earth.', 'Fourth, we must prevent urbanization and growth from ravaging the land. I will suggest, in cooperation with local government and private industry, policies for such prevention. Their goal will be to insure that suburban building, highway construction, industrial spread, are conducted with reverence and with the proper regard for the values of nature.', 'Fifth, we must conduct conservation on a global scale. The Antarctic Treaty, weather and fishery agreements, the treaty with Canada that we celebrated yesterday, are all examples of what can be done if nations will devote common effort to common interest.', 'These are some of the fronts of the new conservation which I will work to carry forward. And I tell you now that this hope will always be among the closest to my heart.', 'From the beginning we have been a people of open spaces. We have lifted our eyes to the deserts and to the mountains, and now we are lifting them to the stars. But on this earth the ring draws closer around us.', 'So let us not leave our task with the reproach of our children already ringing in our ears. Far, far too much is at stake. There are the resources on which our future rests.', ""But there is a good deal more than that. In a thousand unseen ways we have drawn shape and strength from the land. Respect for man and reverence for God have taken root in our spacious soil. In isolation from nature lies the danger of man's isolation from his fellow and from his Creator."", 'All my life I have drawn sustenance from the rivers and from the hills of my native State. I do not see them so often any more these days, and I am lonesome for them almost constantly. But their message of love and challenge is written in my spirit. I want no less for all the children of America than what I was privileged to have as a boy.', 'In the book of Matthew, it says ""The floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.""', 'The house of America is founded upon our land and if we keep that whole, then the storm can rage, but the house will stand forever.', 'This morning you have an unusual assemblage in this room. I was escorted to the dais by a progressive young Republican Governor. I was met by a cordial, hospitable mayor. I flew across the continent with a number of outstanding leaders of the Congress, of the House and of the Senate.', 'You have an unusual quality of leadership in this great Northwest. We celebrated some of the fruits of that planning yesterday in Canada, fruits of the work of men like the two great Senators from Washington, and this wise, veteran legislator from Vermont, George Aiken, who sits on the front row and does me great honor by coming to this area of the Nation with me.', 'Oregon, Washington, California, and Montana, all the great West, is here this morning, not to just talk about the glories of the past, but to try to pull all the talent of this great region together to undertake an adventure of tomorrow.', 'I first came to Portland as a youngster fresh out of uniform in the early days of the war to scrap the battleship Oregon. I saw then all of the hope and the daring, and the idealism, and the spirit of conservation that I have observed reflected by your spokesmen in the halls of the House of Representatives and in the Senate.', 'We have come a long way in those 20 odd years, but we have not gone nearly far enough. The eyes of the Nation are looking to you to provide the leadership that will not just make this the best conservation Congress we have ever had, but that will help us to bring our dreams of a more beautiful America, a safer America, a healthier America available to our children as it has been available to us.', 'Thank you very much for your wonderful hospitality.']",1

And what is true for Morgantown is true for America.', 'I want to commend the people of West Virginia for the high quality of public servants that they have selected. I know of no Members of the Senate with whom I have ever served that have been more diligent or more devoted than your able Senators, Jennings Randolph and Bob Byrd.

He often talked to me about these people. He spoke of your problems, the strength of your people, the courage with which you faced hardship; always the warmth of your hospitality.', 'He wanted so much to help West Virginia. Not because you helped him, but because he believed the progress of West Virginia was a test of the greatness of all of America.', 'So I come here this afternoon to tell you that I share his belief, and I will carry on with his work.', 'West Virginia is making progress.', 'Unemployment has declined 43 percent.', 'New food stamp programs are giving strength to the hungry.', 'Training programs, area redevelopment programs, the Appalachian program, the poverty program, will all give people the skills to find new jobs. They will develop industry to provide those jobs.', 'West Virginia has known more than its share of poverty and idleness and hunger. But let no one say this was because your people were lazy, or indifferent, or without initiative.', 'West Virginians opened our earliest frontiers. West Virginians brought forth the resources which made America grow. West Virginians went forth by the tens of thousands to fight for their country. And thousands of West Virginian boys, your boys, now lay beneath foreign soil, a monument to the courage and the patriotism of the people of West Virginia. You have provided heroes in war and you have provided builders in peace.', 'West Virginia has given much to the land we love, the land of America. America must never forget it, and it will not forget it as long as I am President.', 'I have traveled through your State and I have talked to your people. I have found strong men and women, willing to help at all times. I have found men who want nothing more than a chance to use their minds and their hands to provide for their families, and to build for their country.', 'We are going to give them that chance. We are going to do it because it is right; we are going to do it because it is our duty; we are going to do it because America needs a strong and a growing and a prosperous West Virginia.', 'The problems of West Virginia, your problems, are a consequence of national progress. Industry has moved to new markets. Machines have replaced men. New resources have taken the place of old. These changes were inevitable. They have been part of the growth of a mighty nation. Now the Nation must help those who have been left behind.', 'From the beginning of our history Government has helped provide opportunity to the people. The canals and the public works of the years before the Civil War were built by Government and private enterprise together. The lands of the West were thrown open to the settlers by the Government. Under Abraham Lincoln the Federal Government stimulated education through the land grant colleges. All of these actions provided new jobs and new chances for business, and new stimulation to growth.', 'This partnership and this responsibility is the oldest American tradition. It is one that we recognize, and I pledge you it is one that we plan to continue.', 'Giving a man a chance to work and feed his family and provide for his children does not destroy his initiative. Hunger destroys initiative. Hopelessness destroys initiative. Ignorance destroys initiative. A cold and an indifferent government destroys initiative.', ""We are going to strike away the conditions which damage a man's dignity and self respect, and capacity for fulfillment. We are going to give every man the chance to build his own place in this abundant land of ours. And by doing this we are going to strengthen the initiative of the individual, strengthen the freedom of the Nation, and bring prosperity to all of our people."", 'There are some among us who need more skills and a chance to work. There are the hungry still to be fed and the sick to be tended, and the old to be given dignity in the twilight of life. This, too, is part of America\'s responsibility. God has commanded us, ""They shall not harden their hearts to the needy.""', 'The day America hardens its heart, the day the fortunate turn away from the helpless, the day compassion turns to indifference, on that day we will begin to decline from greatness. So let us pray that that day never comes.', 'Franklin Roosevelt once said, ""Too many who prate about saving democracy are really only interested in saving things as they were. Democracy should concern itself also with things as they ought to be.""', 'This ought to be a land, a nation, a country with compassion for the helpless.

President Abraham Lincoln proposed the first assistance for widows and children. President Theodore Roosevelt called the first White House Conference on Care of Dependent Children. It was President William Howard Taft who first established the Children\'s Bureau.', 'These were works of compassion, triumphs of justice.

In 1908 Oregon limited the hours of work for women. In 1911 Illinois passed the first statute providing mothers aid, the forerunner of aid to families of dependent children. In 1914 the first oldage pension was established in a State where character has not been collectivized by compassion-the great State of Arizona.', 'From Plymouth Rock until this day, Americans have been careful about the welfare of their fellow man.', 'I intend that we shall not be turned from this trait of our American character, or this conviction of our American conscience.

We have fashioned in our years a good society. We shall, in the years to come, dedicate ourselves to making it great.

We must concern ourselves with the level of their income. We must attack the problem of their housing, which is too often inadequate and too often takes more than half of their income.', 'But America must keep her trust with her children, because in 6 more years there will be 10 million more young Americans--10 million more between the ages of 5 and 17, 5 million more between 18 and 21, and here again we must be concerned with the level of income on which many are supported. We must make sure that they can meet their health needs. We must act in every way to strengthen the life of their families.

We must focus our concern on the causes of their troubles, not only on the youths themselves.', 'Yes, to you good members of this honorable and responsible union there is work for you to do, for us to do--work to build this good society better, work to make this strong country the foundation of a great and a compassionate civilization.', 'This is the American way of life, and this is the way that is under attack today from the fringe and from the extremes. I call upon you, here and now, to begin this hour to start fighting in order to save it.', 'Our directions and our destiny must not be placed in the hands of those who would steer a reckless and a callous course. We must be guided not by those whose compass points backward, but by those whose eye and hearts are fixed on the stars that lead us forward.', 'We have no time for arrogance or belligerence. We have no time for callousness on contempt, either in the policies of our Nation or in the hearts of our leaders.', 'Our duty, our opportunity, is to fulfill the rights of all men all over our land, not only because we shall be judged more by what we do at home than what we preach abroad, but because it is right.', 'Once a visitor said to President Lincoln ""We trust, sir, that God is on our side The Great Emancipator turned to him and said quietly, ""It is more important to know that we are on God\'s side.""', ""So we come not with any venom in our blood or any hate in our soul, or any viciousness in our voice this morning. We come and say, let us, then, on this day and in this year, all of us as good Americans who want to do what is best for our country, who want to do what is best for all the people of this great land--let us be sure that the course that we set for our Nation is on God's side"", 'And what is that course? It is a course of peace, it is a course of understanding, is a course of living by the Golden Rule doing unto others as you would have them do unto you. You will be condemned and criticized as Lincoln was. You will be misrepresented and vilified as Roosevelt was. But you must follow in your dealings with your fellow man and with your relations with other nations a course of justice to all, special privilege to none.', 'You must follow a course of compassion and courage. You must love thy neighbor as thyself, and you must try to point the way, and to lift up the weak so that he, too, may be strong. Yes, you must point a course of courage in these trying times when smear and fear and intolerance are abroad in the land, the same courage that brought this Nation into existence, the same courage that held this Union together.', 'The same courage that crossed the oceans on two occasions in our lifetime to preserve freedom in the world was never needed more than it is needed today.

We know not how we may be led. We know not what may be God's will. But His course is to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly.

We have increased flood control programs by more than 50 percent, but we cannot rest on past achievements if we are to rescue our land from the ravages of nature.', 'Third, we must develop a national policy to attack the pollution of our water, and the pollution of the air that we breathe. This must require research, this will require increased construction of treatment plants and better methods of control. Polluted water is wasted water, and America cannot afford this waste.', 'Fourth, we will continue to press ahead with weather satellites, deep sea nuclear weather stations, and other scientific advances so that we can understand the weather and so that we can become its master.', 'Fifth, I am asking for early passage of the Water Resources Planning Act to help us look ahead to future patterns of water needs, to look ahead to plan our projects so that supply will be ready for demand.', 'Sixth, we will begin to draw fresh water from the oceans before very long.

We have a minimum wage that says to our workers they must pay you this minimum and they must work you this maximum, and in just the short period that I have been in Congress we have gone from 25 cents minimum to $1.25 minimum. Just the short time I have been there we are working less hours per day and less days per week, and less weeks per year. We have more time for recreation, more time for the luxuries of life than our fathers and our grandfathers had, to come out to lakes like this and dams like this.', 'We have a social security system that will give us a modicum of income when we reach our maturity and are no longer able to stay in the labor market. We are proud of the farm programs that we have had that have raised the income of our tenant farmers, that have raised our home ownership, that have brought us rural electrification.', 'I flew over this afternoon from Muskogee and I looked at all the little ponds that were filled with water that had been built here in just the last few years. I said to Senator Monroney, he must be mighty proud of the efforts that he and other Congressmen from Oklahoma had made because that was a tribute not only to them, but to their people, that they had made this soil better through their own efforts.', 'Well, there are voices that have questioned me about minimum wage. When I voted for the first bill it was 25 cents an hour, and they told me it would ruin me and they said it would ruin the labor organizations, too. But we are all here, and it looks to me like we are doing better at $1.25 than we were at 25 cents.', ""I remember before I was elected, when I was just a kid secretary talking to my Congressman about voting for social security, I heard all the scare arguments and all the fright that they tried to put into men. They said it is socialistic, it is compulsory, it is evil, it will destroy our form of government. I think we are better for it. I think we are stronger for it. I think we are richer for it. I don't think many people would like to do away with either our minimum wage or our social security."", ""As your President I deal every day with the problems that affect your freedom and affect the peace of the world. Those problems may be remote from this peaceful site out here this afternoon. Not many of you get waked up in the night about Cyprus, or Zanzibar, or Viet-Nam.

Those who attack this structure of partnership assault an American tradition as old as this Nation.', ""And I intend, as long as I am President, to make sure that the American Government is a model of prudence and economy, and that doesn't mean that we are going to neglect the sick or forget the unemployed, repeal social security, or turn our farmers out to the pasture. It means that we are going to have faith in the people, and with the people together work to build a better democracy."", 'It does not mean that we are going to have a labor Government. It does not mean that we are going to have a business Government. It means that we are going to ask labor and business to join hands and to have a democratic Government. I am determined that Government discharge its solemn duty to cooperate in strengthening our free enterprise system, and to give all the freedom possible to all Americans.', 'And the fact is that all of the programs of your Government have a single aim: the freedom and the happiness of our people and the vitality of our great free enterprise system which has made America what it is today.', 'There are two philosophies at each others throat in the world--the Democratic philosophy and the Communist philosophy. If we win, if we survive, if freedom prevails, it is not going to be because we have more people than they do, it is not going to be because we have more acres than they do, because they have several times more tillable acres than we have and they have many millions more people than we have.', 'It is not going to be because we have more resources than they have. It is going to be because we have a system of government that is better than theirs. It is going to be because our people do not believe in regimentation and centralization and socialization.', 'Our people believe that a capitalist ought to be able to take his dollar and invest it, that he ought to be allowed a reasonable return on that dollar without fear of having it confiscated; that a manager ought to come along and help invest that dollar in a producing enterprise; and that the manager that gets up at daylight and stays up until midnight and develops stomach ulcers while he is doing it, he is entitled to a 2-week vacation, a bonus once in a while, a little profit sharing, and social security when he is 65.', ""With that capitalist who invests his dollar, and with that manager who manages, we have the worker who produces. He gets on the assembly line and every 27 seconds he puts the rivets in the top of a car, and on every one that comes by. And if he doesn't get them all in in 27 seconds, and it takes 28 to put them in, then that car goes out without a rivet. He does that all day long."", ""But he is the greatest producer in all the world--the American workingman. He doesn't ask much either. He wants a little vacation. He would like to have a little sick leave, he hopes he has a little medical care, he has some things that he wants, he wants a rug on the floor, and a picture on the wall, and a little music in the house. He wants a church that he can worship in according to the dictates of his own conscience. He wants a school that he can send his children to and he hopes they get better education than he got. He doesn't ask for the world with a fence around it. All he wants is to make America a better land."", ""I am here to tell you that if we all--Democrats, Republicans, and whatnots--do what is best for America, it will be best for us. I want all of you to do everything you can here at home because we have enough to do in Washington without your coming up there and asking our help. I know you don't believe in the Federal Government doing much anyway. But when I come flying into these places, I fly into an airport built with Federal funds, I get on an interstate highway built with Federal funds, and I go downtown and talk States' rights. And I hear about them, too."", ""We have on the platform today two Governors from our two States, Oklahoma and your neighbor. One of them is a Democrat, John Connally, and the other is a Republican, Governor Bellmon. But we want to work with both of them to make America stronger and better and richer for all of our people. And don't ever get so selfish but what you forget that what is good for your country is good for you."", ""And let's put aside the slogans and the false warnings. Let's look at the facts. Let's see what your Government actually does."", 'First, more than half of our national budget, $52.5 billion, is used to defend you. This is the ultimate protector of your freedom. It is what permits you to go to bed at night without fear that somebody will rap on your door at midnight and order you into the hoosegow. I want to tell you as long as I am President, I intend to keep our defenses the best in all the world.', 'Second, more than 10 percent of our national budget goes directly to help States and communities meet their own problems on the local level. I will talk to you about a few of them, some of your Hill-Burton hospitals, some of your highways, some of your airports, some of your farm programs.', 'Third, your Government has programs of cooperation and partnership with private enterprise. The Small Business Administration has made more than 20,000 loans to thousands of struggling small businesses. It has created more than 400,000 jobs. The area redevelopment program helped to rebuild stricken parts of our country so that business could come and prosper and men could find new jobs.', 'The agricultural programs have given our farmers the confidence in the future which lets them invest and modernize. We have not solved all of our farm problems, but we have come a long way from 1933 when they were throwing men out of windows -when they tried to foreclose all of our farms.', ""I don't think anyone seriously believes that we have destroyed the will to work or the will to produce. The truth is that we have the most abundant, free agricultural economy in the history of the world. And I am somewhat proud of the fact that our farmers did such a good job that they had all we needed to feed all the American people, and the Communists had to come over here to buy wheat to make bread for their own people."", 'Fourth, for our entire history we have worked with local government and private enterprise to develop the power and the water, the roads and the canals which are really the foundation of industry in this country. And as long as I am your President, your Government is going to devote full energy in developing all of these resources, and one of them that we are now developing is the Arkansas River.', 'Fifth, research and technology have made possible the modern aircraft industry, the atomic power industry, and the nitrates on which agriculture depends.', 'Sixth, we have an investment partnership in human resources, in education, in skill training, in health. Think about what has been done with polio alone. Think about how every mother in this country dreaded and feared spring and summer to come because they were afraid their children would wind up crippled. And think about how their dreams of some day finding a medicine, a vaccine, that would prevent all of this terrible suffering. And those dreams have now come to pass.', 'All of these programs are designed to provide America with protection, designed to provide America with the skilled people that it needs, designed to give people a chance to take a productive role in the Nation. And that is why your forefathers set up a system of public education. A great President of the Republic of Texas before we came into the Union once said, ""An educated mind is the guardian genius of democracy. It is the only dictator that free men recognize, and it is the only ruler that free men design.""', 'So a system of public education, every dollar invested in education today, brings a return of 10 to 12 percent in national wealth, and that is a pretty good return on a dollar invested--10 to 12 percent.', 'Seventh, we have a system of Government protection designed to liberate free enterprise for growth. The SEC that was born during the Roosevelt administration has helped make all of us a nation of capitalists. Insurance for your hard-earned savings in your savings and loans, in your banks, has protected the greatest banking system in all the world, and they are not popping like firecrackers as they once were. Antitrust legislation has made it possible for smaller businesses to survive and for competition to flourish.', 'The drug laws and the food laws have given the consumer the confidence on which rising sales depend. Other laws, by eliminating abuses, have made it unnecessary to adopt measures which might strangle the workings of our market economy.', 'Eighth, programs--from the food stamp program to unemployment compensation to social security give people a better chance to stand on their own feet, to help themselves in our own free enterprise tradition.', ""I remember as a young man standing in the corridors of the Congress back in the early 1930's, when I heard one Congressman that was a friend of mine say that he was seriously considering voting against social security because they used some horrible name about it--they called it socialistic and socialism, and it was changing our form of government. But it is mighty hard to find a man today--you have to travel north, south, east, and west to find one--that would repeal our social security system."", 'Yes, Americans recognize the duty of a rich and compassionate nation to assist the old, to assist the sick, and to assist the helpless. All of us were taught to follow the Golden Rule of ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" And that is what your Government is going to do as long as J am your President.', 'These are the facts and not the slogans.', 'I just wish that we had as good a chance for rain down home as you have here. We have been caking our old cows all summer, and we are out of pears down there.', 'But these are the facts and not the slogans. It contributes to the vitality of our free enterprise system and the freedom of the individual.', 'The fact is that never in our American history has your American business been more alive, been more growing, been filled with greater opportunity than it is now. And I think that you know in your heart that that is right.', 'And all you have to do is turn on your television, or buy your morning or afternoon paper, or listen to your neighbor down the street, to realize that never in our history have Americans been freer to criticize or to pursue their ambitions, or to live as they want to live, as they are today. And I think that you know in your heart that that is right.', 'Well, these are the fruits of the partnership that we have built, that your father and mother and your granddaddy helped us build. And this is the partnership we are going to continue between the Government and the people as long as I am your President. And I think you know in your heart that we have so much to be thankful for, so much to protect, so much to preserve.', ""So let's go home tonight and let's don't weep on our pillow. Let's say our prayers and thank our good Lord Almighty that we are as lucky as we are, and that we enjoy the blessings that are ours."", 'Goodby and good luck.']",1

It would not be the issue if the responsible views of the responsible men in the responsible party were represented in this campaign. I say that because I have more respect for the Republican Party than some of those who have taken over its name this year.', 'Responsibility is the issue.', 'Responsibility is the choice.', 'The American people can choose to keep government that is responsible, like the kind of government that you have had 3 1/2 years under Jack Kennedy and 10 months under Lyndon Johnson. Or the American people can choose to change the government to a government that is reckless abroad and reckless at home.', 'I believe I know what your choice is going to be.', 'In all this Nation no citizens anywhere value responsibility in government more highly than the great citizens of the great State of Connecticut. You have responsible government at the State level. You have responsible government at the local level. You have gotten good government because you have insisted on it and because you have been active in it.', 'You people of Connecticut have led the entire Nation since World War II in building highways, in supporting better schools, in rebuilding your cities, in retraining your workers. And the benefits show up in all the faces that I see out there today. They show up in all your lives.', 'In all this lovable, prosperous, progressive land of the United States, the State of Connecticut is one of the most prosperous States. Your personal income averages $740 more than the average of the rest of the Nation. You have fewer families living in poverty than any other State in the Union, and you ought to be proud of that. In fact, with the help of Congressman Daddario and Abe Ribicoff, Tom Dodd and John Bailey, and Governor Dempsey, if Connecticut holds its progressive course that you are now following, you will be the first State in the Union to win the war on poverty.', 'I know this is the work that you want to keep on doing. I know this is the work that you want your country to keep on doing.', 'The character of our country, of all the Nation, was really formed right here in New England. Wherever Americans live, there is a little of New England in them. Our Nation has gotten far more from this New England region than can ever be returned to it. But the greatest of your contributions are two traits that are deep in the American character.', 'One of those traits is prudence--caution, care, responsibility. The other is progress.', 'As President Kennedy said, ""Keep the country moving."" The American people throughout this Nation are a prudent people, and they want and they expect prudence in their Government. But the American people are also a progressive people, and they want to keep on progressing. They want to keep on making progress toward a better land and toward a better life. In short, the American people, from Connecticut to Texas, want to keep moving.', 'Prudence and progress are the watchwords of this administration that serves you now.', ""We have increased our Nation's strength until today the United States is the strongest Nation in all the world. We have, at the same time, controlled your Government spending so that the budget that I presented for fiscal 1965 was lower than the budget for 1964."", 'In relation to gross national product, total Federal spending in 1965--are you listening?--total Federal spending in 1965 will be the lowest in 14 years, and nondefense spending will be lower than it was 30 years ago and lower than in all but 2 postwar years.', 'We have been frugal without being fatalists and without being fanatical. For we have kept America on the move--we have been meeting our needs, we have been solving our problems, we have been fulfilling the hopes of our people.', 'This session of the Congress has been the most productive and the most constructive in all American history.', ""Ten months ago, after that terrible tragedy that thrust upon me, without a moment's notice, the responsibility of the Presidency, I tried to pick up where President Kennedy had left off. I tried to carry forward a program for all of you that he had dreamed of for you."", 'And when we took the scoreboard, we listed 51 major measures that should be considered. And of those 51 major measures, most of the newspaper people who travel with me today said if we could pass 2 we would have a successful session. If we could pass the tax bill, which was not moving in committee, and the civil rights bill, we would call it a successful session.', ""I came here to Connecticut today to report to you that we not only passed those 2 bills, and they are already the law of the land, but the United States Senate, of which Abe Ribicoff and Tom Dodd are two of the leaders, has passed each and every single one of the 51 measures. And that is the truth that you can't wash away."", 'I know that you people out there in that crowd know in your heart that that is good for America.', 'We have much work yet to do, but we are going to do it. We are not going to turn back the clock. We are going to rebuild our cities as you are rebuilding Hartford.', ""We are going to meet the people's needs for fast and efficient transportation so they won't lose 2 hours a day trying to get to and from work. We are on the way. We are going to create new jobs and train new people with new skills. Because this is the responsible way and the Democratic Party is the responsible party, and this is the true American way."", 'For so long as there has been an America, there have been times when factions have risen up in our land.

But there is a deep and abiding commitment to peace, and that commitment to peace and that part of our character that wants peace is going to get peace. We don't have a national police force. We don't have a gestapo that we can send into your town overnight. We have a wonderful Bureau of Investigation that is available to your Governor, to your mayor, and to your local people. We are going to work with them to make our streets and our cities safer, but what we really want to do is to make all the streets in the world safer for all people."", 'The first time that I came to Hartford to speak was more than 5 years ago. I came to speak to members of my own party, the Democratic Party. At that moment there was a grim challenge to our country from the Communist forces abroad. The then President of the United States was a member of the Republican Party. I was a leader of the Democratic Party in the Senate.', 'I told the members of my Democratic Party that night here in Hartford, 5 years ago, as I tell all of you here today, that I was not going to attack that President, the only President we had, even if he were a Republican--I was not going to make his job more difficult. Because I have always, and I will always, put the peace and security of America, the peace and security of my country, ahead of the interests of the Democratic Party.', 'And I think I know that that is what you, in your hearts, want me to do. I have always believed that if you will do what is best for America, you will do what is best for our party.', ""And I want to leave another thought with you. I voted for and I supported that Republican President more on his Republican program than some present members of the Republican Party did. And I never at any time called it by another name. At times I differed. On occasions I opposed but I opposed it with dignity and decency. And you never heard from the lips of a single member of the Democratic Party that President Eisenhower's program was just a 10-cent model of the New Deal."", 'No, I tell you when your country is in trouble, when people are trying to divide, when hate and fear is abroad in the land, it is time for the people of New England to lead the way, to start the march of unity, and to say to the rest of the world that we learned a long time ago, ""United we stand; divided we fall.""', 'Now, I know some of you have come out here through courtesy today. Some of you are hospitable. Some of you want to be good to your President.

I just want to ask you: Are we going to be united in November?', 'Well, it looks like some of you have heard the echo.', 'There is a time for party and there is a place for partisanship. But there are times in the history of a Nation when higher values matter more than party, and there are greater issues than partisanship. Your two Senators proved that time and time again. I believe that today is such a time in our national life.', ""All that America is, and all that you want America to be, is challenged today by those who stand on the fringe. Against such a choice as this, responsible people have only one course of conscience, and that is to choose their country's interests over all other interests. I believe that this is a choice that you will make come this November."", 'For I pledge you--and hear these words-that the next Johnson administration will follow the course once set by a great President, Abraham Lincoln, who told us: ""Beware of rashness, but with energy and sleepless vigilance go forward and give us victories.""']",1

All my life I have had great respect for the business leadership of the great State of Connecticut and for that matter, all New England.', 'I asked when I came here today that I might have an opportunity to meet some of that leadership so I could observe the countenances that had provided the initiative and the adventure and the vision for a substantial part of our free enterprise system in America.', 'As we meet here, there are two great philosophies that are rivals in the world-and one or the other will ultimately prevail.', ""One philosophy is the democratic philosophy that has been practiced in this country from the time of our first President, George Washington, up until this moment.

I am proud to say to you that we are standing up, we are resisting, and we are trying to halt the envelopment of freedom anywhere in the world. Although there are more than 120 nations in the world, and although there are dozens of nations that have been born in the last decade, we have not lost a single nation to communism since 1959.', ""Now these two philosophies are in a struggle. They are after each other's jugular, and if we survive it will not be because we have more people than they have, because they outpopulate us. There are many more millions in the Soviet Union than we have in the United States. They have more than 600 million acres of tillable land and we have less than 200 million, so they have a lot more tillable soil. They outnumber us in many of our greatest resources and their potential in other ways far exceeds ours."", 'So in resources, in human beings, in tillable acres, we are all at a disadvantage. What do we rely on? We rely on the one great advantage that the American people have: that is our system of government.', 'Now, that system is not built on any one party, or any one people, or any one section, or any one religion, or any one group. That system that we know as the free enterprise system is made up of really four important segments.', 'The first is the capitalist. Some of you have been known as capitalists in your time and some of you not many years ago were even called royalists--""economic royalists,"" I believe it was. You have been so referred to from time to time in various campaigns in America because sometimes you asked for it, and sometimes you couldn\'t avoid it.', 'But the capitalist is the man that, through prudence, accumulates wealth and takes that money and is willing to invest it. It may be to rebuild a whole new area. It may be to put skyscrapers in the sky. It may be to provide production lines for jobs. It may be to build railroads and dams. It can follow many lines.', ""But he invests that dollar in America with a reasonable assurance that it will not be confiscated and will not be taken away from him by some government that stages a coup in the midnight hours, and that he will be secure in his possessions without fear that some night at midnight someone will rap on his door and serve him a warrant and lead him off to jail. He hopes that he may get a reasonable return on it. Sometimes he does and sometimes he doesn't. Sometimes he gets it all back plus 5 or 6 percent, sometimes he loses it all."", 'But anyway, he has hope and he has a chance, he has an opportunity, and he is willing to take care of the rest himself, if you give him that--and he has that in America.', 'That capitalist is joined by what you call a manager.', 'That manager is the fellow that gets up at daylight and works to midnight and develops stomach ulcers trying to get a bonus or trying to have a profit-sharing plan, or trying to build a better mousetrap at less cost, trying to compete not only with his fellowman here but with the rest of the world.', 'He takes his chances where he finds them and if he loses, he fusses with his wife about it, but he takes it in stride. Sometimes he has a good profit. For 43 months now he has had a rather good record, but the next 43 might not be so good, so he has to take it.', 'But he joins with the capitalist and he manages that dollar, he sees where it is invested and he tries to exercise prudence and yet exercise vision.', ""Then the third segment there is the worker who gets to work at 8 and works to 5, and he has 27 seconds to put the number of rivets in that car or that plane that he needs to. If he doesn't get them in in the 27 seconds he goes to 28. That car or that plane moves on down the line--and it doesn't have the rivets in it! And you've wound up with a car that is missing a rivet a time or two yourselves. We all do that. But that poor fellow gets a coffee break twice a day.

We have a growing population, we are moving on-we have more schools, more roads, more needs to fill."", 'But I spent the first 37 days and nights I was in office trying to find some way, somehow, some means to keep that budget under $100 billion, because I thought psychologically it would be a good thing.', 'I thought if we could not pull down our expenses in a great era of prosperity I did not know when we could pull them down. So instead of a budget of $5 billion more-$103.8 billion--we reduced it. And I had the help of Republicans. President Eisenhower came down and worked with me 2 days. Bob Anderson, the Secretary of the Treasury under President Eisenhower, came down and worked with me almost a month.', ""I had the budget directors from other administrations come in. I got all of the advice I could get, because nobody needed it any more than I did. We finally developed a budget that was $1 billion less in '65 than it was in '64."", 'While we were doing that, we passed a tax bill. We put some of the money back for the people to spend instead of letting the Government spend it for them. We put some of the money back for business to invest in new enterprise instead of the Government investing it for them.', 'So as a result, we have more men working today than we have ever had before. Our profits are higher, our wages are higher, our economics are better, our system is producing.', ""Don't you tell me for a moment that we can't outproduce and outwork and outright any communistic system in the world.

So don't ever get both of them off the ground at one time."", 'Now I am going to conclude by telling you a story. It is one of the real reasons I asked to meet you insurance people up here today.', 'You remember back in the thirties when we had to have all of the reforms, and we had the problems in the Stock Exchange, and we had men committing suicide and folks jumping out of windows, and banks popping like firecrackers, and all of the economic problems ?', 'Well, during that period Mr. Rayburn had to be the author of the Holding Company Act. He came from a little red, sandy land farm down in Texas, and he was just a farm boy. But he had to author the Stock Exchange Act, and he set up the Securities and Exchange Commission, and he had all of these great economic financial reforms.', 'Right in the middle of it, Mr. Whitney came in and asked him if he wouldn\'t come up to speak to the Bond Club in New York City. And he said, ""Who is the Bond Club?""', '""Well,"" Mr. Whitney said, ""it is a group of people who deal in bonds and investments and who are financial experts. As a prerequisite to membership you have to have a good financial statement--$1 million or more. We would like to hear you and we would like to invite you.""', ""This fellow was testifying before Mr. Rayburn's committee, and he kind of wanted to ingratiate himself anyway. So Mr. Rayburn, very much to his surprise, said yes, he would accept the invitation."", 'The fellow who extended the invitation was almost sorry that he had ever asked him, because he did not think he would accept. But Mr. Rayburn went up there, and the fellow was a little embarrassed in front of all of these millionaires to introduce this sandy land farmer from Texas who had put all of these reforms through--called it ""death sentence,"" you remember, on holding companies, and they were going to ruin all of the power companies and destroy everything.', 'So he got up to introduce Mr. Rayburn, and he said, ""Fellows, I invited this man to come up here. I don\'t know why he came. But here he is, Sam Rayburn,"" and that was the only introduction they gave him.', 'That is more than you all gave me today. I just had to get up here and talk!', 'Mr. Rayburn got up and said, ""I came up for two reasons. If you don\'t know why I came, I want to tell you."" He said, ""All of my life I have been poor. I have just a modicum of wealth, and I have accumulated a little, and I have worked mighty hard for it and have saved it. I haven\'t married, I\'ve saved every penny I had. I haven\'t spent it on my family, but I have never yet been able to acquire a million dollars. I wanted to come up and associate with all of you fellows who have been successful, and just hope that a little bit of it would rub off On me.', '""So that is the first reason I came.""', 'And he said, ""The next reason I came was to show you I ain\'t scared of you!""', 'So I really have three reasons for coming up here today. I want to associate with you and learn things from you, and ask you to help your Government and to counsel with us and give us all of the advice you can. Because we need it.', 'Second, I want to commend you for the contribution you have made to your Government during these 10 months when we have had a real critical period on our hands.', ""I don't know how much longer I will be there--you may change in November. But I want to ask you to help whoever is President, because it is an awesome responsibility to carry the weight of 190 million people and their future on your shoulders. And no man ever occupied that office--there have been 35 of them--that didn't do his dead level best. I never have seen a one that I thought ran on a platform of doing what he thought was wrong. They all do what they think is right, but sometimes they make mistakes, and they need your judgment."", ""Finally, I want to tell you that I appreciate what you have done for me, and with me, and most of all for your Government, for your country, regardless of your religion, or your party, or where you live. And finally, I just wanted all of you to know I wasn't scared of you.""]",1

Johnson ,"September 28, 1964","[""Governor and Mrs. Hoff, Senator Fayette, Senator O'Shea, Mayor Daley, Mr. O'Brien, Mrs. Schurman, Mr. Ryan, my fellow Americans:"", 'This is my second annual visit to Vermont. I came here last year and, if you extend my welcome, I would like to make it a habit.', 'We want to thank you, genuinely thank you, for being so patient and understanding about our problems today. This is a wonderful sight to behold from this platform-to see so many friendly, smiling, happy faces from the fire truck over here all the way around. It gives us great joy to know that you would want to come here and say hello to my party.', ""This is the third appearance I have made since I left Washington, and every place we have been, we have been met with courtesy and hospitality and enthusiasm. We are very sorry we are late, but we are so happy we finally got here. You know, you can't really object if you are late because you are seeing people. What would really disappoint us would be if we had gotten here ahead of time because there would have been nobody to meet us."", 'Ten months ago, because of a terrible tragedy, we lost a man we all loved so much as a leader and as a friend, the President of our country. In a matter of moments, I became your President and had to try to pick up where he left off. Since that time we have had the Congress in session and we have been considering the program that President Kennedy had recommended.', 'We analyzed that program very carefully when we went in, and there were 51 major measures before the Congress that needed attention, and we would hope would be considered. This morning, about 6:45, I talked to Senator Mansfield, the great leader of the Senate, and he reminded me then that all of those 51 measures had passed the Senate as of now.', ""I want to be fair. Some of them are in conference and will have to be adjusted between the two Houses. Some of them won't be passed by the House of Representatives, I am sure. But I do want to say that we have much to be thankful for, and much to be grateful for."", 'We want to say to you good people of Vermont that we appreciate the support you have given us, we appreciate the prayers you have said for us, we appreciate the way you have tried to hold up our hand and help us do the very best job that we could do.', 'Sitting in Washington, surrounded by papers and officials, you sometimes begin to lose track of the real source of the strength of the United States, the real strength of America. That is why it is inspiring for us to come to this State, whose hills and valleys have contributed so much to the leadership of America.', 'Some of that leadership has come from the ranks of my party. Phil Hoff, your great Governor, has not only given you good government; he has made a national reputation as an outstanding servant of the people, and he is respected throughout the land. I know of no young Governor in any of the 50 States that I have more confidence in, or that I am more anxious to work with.', 'And when I was here in October, I got to know Fred Fayette. He is proof that you still have more outstanding young men here in Vermont on the way up. I hope that come next January, after we get through with the inauguration, that all of you folks can go from the Capitol Grounds where we begin the parade, up to the Senate Office Building, and see your new Democratic United States Senator, Fred Fayette.', 'But in Vermont, as in the Nation, leadership dedicated to progress is not confined just to one party. All the patriotism in this country is not in the Democratic Party or in the Republican Party. No party has a monopoly on good judgment, on good service, or on patriotism.', 'Some of our most distinguished Americans, as well as some of my warmest friends, are Vermont Republicans. There is George Aiken, who has been one of the architects of the bipartisan foreign policy of this country, which has protected freedom through the administrations of four different Presidents.', 'And it was only last week that I went to see the Prime Minister of Canada. I flew across the Nation. We went there to meet in connection with the treaty between our country and Canada in order to better relations. Senator Aiken was on that trip. He represented not only the Republican Party, but represented all Americans, because he is known as the guiding genius of our relations between Canada and the United States.', 'Of course, there is the shining memory of Warren Austin, another Republican, who did as much as any man in this century to lead America toward responsible partnership in world affairs.', 'These men were never divided by narrow partisanship. They were never divided by sectional pride. They asked themselves this question: ""What is good for my country? What is good for America?"" And they believed that what was good for America was good for them and good for their party.', ""They drew their strength not from your granite hills, but from Vermont's historic traditions. This is a State which has looked to the future always, which has acted courageously and wisely to meet the challenge of the future:"", ""Vermont's Green Mountain boys, with a little help from New Hampshire and Massachusetts, won the first offensive victory of the Revolution."", 'Vermont drafted the first State constitution to forbid slavery.', 'Vermont was the first State admitted to the Union after the original thirteen.', 'Vermont was the first State to make constitutional provision for a complete State system of education.', 'Vermont was the first State to set aside land for schools in each township.', 'Vermonters went West to help build many of the States of the Northeast and the Mississippi Valley.', 'Half of the able-bodied men of Vermont went to fight in the Civil War.', 'And in our own time, Vermonters have displayed the same vision and the same leadership on the world scene. From the United Nations to the test ban treaty, Vermonters have been in the forefront for peace and for freedom.', 'Well, I believe deeply in the Democratic Party. But throughout my career I have worked closely and gained inspiration from Republican colleagues like many of those that you have sent to Washington. I have never put my party ahead of my country; and I never shall.', 'We had shared a common belief in the future of America and the principles of progress. We believe that this country had a duty to act responsibly and courageously.', 'And this is not the case this year.', 'This year our proud tradition of responsible partisanship is endangered. This year the progress won in three decades of patient striving--by Democrats and Republicans alike--is in danger.', 'At home we have pursued policies that have improved the well-being of all of our people. At home, today, these policies are in danger, and you ought to know they are in danger, and you ought to do something about it. I think you are going to, come next November.', 'Around the world we have followed the course of using our power with restraint, of helping others achieve freedom and self-government, of learning to live with people who share this planet with us. Well, I tell you today that that course is in danger.', 'One of our great parties has been captured, captured by a faction of men who stand outside the whole range of common agreement and common principles which have brought us to the summit of success. These men have not just marched out of step with American progress--they have refused and they now refuse to march at all. If they gain control of our Government, they would not change the direction of our march; they would just halt it altogether.', 'They have already said that their aim is not to pass laws, but to repeal them.', 'Which laws do they mean?', 'Do they mean the REA that has brought electricity to all the farm homes of America? Well, they will never repeal that, will they?', ""They oppose the Minimum Wage Act which gives protection to underpaid Americans, and which has increased the prosperity of all Americans by boosting purchasing power. And I don't believe they are going to repeal the minimum wage, do you?"", ""They oppose legislation to help improve our colleges and our universities. And I don't believe they are going to repeal that law, do you?"", ""They opposed the atomic test ban treaty which ended the radioactive poisoning of our atmosphere, and which was supported by Republicans from Vermont. But I don't believe you want to repeal that treaty either, do you?"", 'They opposed the tax cut which means higher incomes and more jobs and expanding business for all of our people, and which will increase income in Vermont by $54 million. Do you want that bill repealed?', 'Well, most Americans, I think, as I recall back in 1935, when the bill was passed, there were just a handful of votes against it; most Americans, I believe, feel that we should have a social security system which helps old people live in dignity and security. Well, when social security was proposed back there in 1935, I believe, 30 years ago, some of these people called it a ""cruel hoax."" But most Americans didn\'t think so, and it was passed. I don\'t believe they want it voluntary and I don\'t believe they want it repealed, do you?', ""When the war on poverty was proposed in January, this faction said it was an attempt to buy votes. But most Americans didn't think so, and they passed the bill in the Senate with the support of some of our friends from Vermont. They passed it in the House. It is now the law of the land and we are going to do something about making taxpayers out of taxeaters. We are going to conduct a war on poverty and try to help the poor find jobs."", 'Most Americans believe in providing every boy and girl with an education that they can use. Some of this faction has said, ""The child has no right to an education.""', 'In the past 4 years dozens of programs and pledges of the 1960 Republican platform have come before the Congress. They have received support from Democrats and Republicans alike. But this faction has opposed most of them.', 'The philosophy that would tear down these programs, in my judgment, does not represent the people of Vermont and does not even represent the Republican Party of Vermont. They do not represent the Republican Party of America. They do not represent the view of responsible, forward-looking men of any party anywhere.', 'And they do not look forward to the kind of America which this State for almost two centuries has worked, and fought, and voted to build.', ""And it is not the kind of America that you are going to vote for, I don't think, next November."", 'My own party does not believe in partisanship for the sake of partisanship. When I became leader of the Senate, I said I reject the philosophy that it is the duty of the opposition to oppose. I said I think it is my duty as a Democrat to support a Republican President, President Eisenhower, when he is right, and to oppose him when he is wrong. I am here to say to you I kept that pledge and I supported him more and supported the Republican President and the Republican Party and the Republican program more when I was Democrat leader than my opponent in this race supported him then. And he was a Republican!', 'I intend for the Johnson administration to take account of that principle and to bring into Government men and women of both parties who are pledged to continue the progress of the past 30 years.', 'When Franklin Roosevelt became President, he selected three Republicans to be in his Cabinet.', 'When Harry Truman was President, he appointed men like Robert Lovett and John McCloy to high positions.', 'When John Kennedy became President in 1961, he brought to Washington outstanding Republicans like Henry Cabot Lodge, Robert McNamara, Douglas Dillon, John McCone, Chris Herter, and others.', 'I believe this is good sense, and I am going to do the same.', ""I do not believe that the faction that temporarily leads the Republican Party represents all the people. I know it doesn't represent all the Republicans. So, my fellow Americans, let us work together, men of every region, of every religion, of every race, of every party. Let us labor to pass on to our children an America more united, an America more prosperous, an America more progressive, an America more peaceful than ever before in our history."", 'Let us be faithful to our traditions of the past so that future generations will say of us, as we say of our forefathers, ""They guarded and handed on the American dream.""', 'It has been wonderful to be here with you this afternoon. I apologize again for being late. I just want to leave this thought with you: In this country, the people are the bosses. You determine by your vote who you want to lead this Nation. Ten months ago, because of provisions of the Constitution, the Vice President succeeded to the Presidency. I have done, with the ability that I have and such talents as I possess, my dead-level best to lead this country and to do what is right by all of its people.', 'I have not tried to be a President that believed in a labor government, or a business government, or a farm government, or an extreme government of any kind. I have tried to be a President of all the people. I have made mistakes like other men. I tried to make as few as I could. I have always thought I was doing right. I have done the best I knew how.', 'You people have given me strength. When I felt depressed, you have inspired me. I have come here today, prior to the time you make a decision. In November you will be called upon to exercise the highest responsibility of an American citizen. You live in the greatest Nation in the world, and how great it is in the future is going to depend upon the wisdom of your decision. In November when you go to that ballot box, you are going to do what you think is best for your country, and that is what I want you to do.', ""If I were acting for you, I would vote for Congressman O'Shea, and I would vote for Senator Fayette, and I would vote for Phil Hoff, and I won't get personal, but I will tell you somebody else I would vote for!"", 'I am not here to give you a hard sell today. You have the right and you have the privilege, and you have the duty, to make a change and to bring a new government if you think your safety and your security and the future of your children will be best served by that change. If you do, we will have no hard feelings. Actually, I will have more time really to visit Vermont.', 'But if you decide in your wisdom that you want us to continue, you want us to carry on, we will go back there in January and we will try to pull together the people of this country.', ""We won't have a government of the north or the south or the east or the west. We will have a government of all sections, of all people, of all regions, of all religions, of all races. We will try to unite instead of divide. We will try to love instead of to hate. We will try to get along in the world instead of abuse our neighbors. We will try to go anywhere, see anyone, do anything that we can do with honor to bring peace to all the people of this world."", ""We are a very small minority. We have only 190 million people in a world of over 3 billion. There is ferment, there is unrest, there is division, there is dissension. There are many problems to be solved. I don't know that I am the one to solve them. That is a matter for you to decide."", ""But I do want you to know this: I don't know how many Presidents are as lucky and as fortunate as I am to get a chance to come here in the autumn season to the lovely little State of Vermont and look you in the face and tell you that I want your help, I want your hand, I want your prayers.

We believe that it is every American's duty to support his Government, but not necessarily in the style to which it has been accustomed. That is why I have cut the budget by almost a billion dollars. And we have many thousand less people on the Federal payroll today than we did 10 months ago."", 'The people of Maine work hard for their tax dollars. The Johnson administration is going to make sure that you get full value for every dollar your Government spends.', 'Second, I pledge a government which will meet the challenges of the future without deserting the traditions of the past. We have built the prosperity of the country on a broad, national agreement about the great goals and the great principles of the great land that we call America.', 'Forward-looking men and women of every party, from Maine to Texas, from every region of America, have shaped the structure of our modern country.

With these qualities as our foundation, we can work together to create a more abundant future for all the people of this State and this region.', 'The people of Maine have never been afraid of government--or afraid of anything, for that matter.

We have done this by working with others to fight indirect aggression-from Viet-Nam to Venezuela.', 'We are doing this through the Peace Corps every day, through the Alliance for Progress, through foreign assistance, aiding others to build their nations and strengthen their independence, and bring hope to their people and give them education, and keep them from starvation. So we are strengthening the independence of others.', 'Third, we have worked to establish the rule of peaceful settlement in world affairs. The key to our own success as a Nation is obedience to the rule of law. This is also the hope for peace in the world community. So we will continue to work for this principle and we will continue our wholehearted support of the United Nations.', 'Fourth, we have worked to lessen the danger that nuclear weapons will destroy all mankind. From the Baruch plan of President Truman to the ""open skies"" proposal of President Eisenhower, to the test ban treaty and the ""hot line,"" every President has worked to build the structure of agreement on which enduring peace must ultimately rest.', 'And as long as I am your President, I will propose new initiatives for effective arms control. I will try to reverse the arms race. I will try to lessen the tensions that endanger and imperil the world.', 'These are the four pillars on which the house of peace must rest.', 'Today there are some who attack these policies. They assault the steadfast principles of the last 20 years. They seek to substitute a new structure. But t think it is a dangerous, shaky, and unsafe place. For I think it is built on three illusions. These illusions, if believed and followed, would put our freedom and the peace of the world in mortal peril.', 'Let me, in the words of the prophet Isaiah, ""Come now, let us reason together,"" let me take a moment to discuss these with you.', ""First is the illusion that force, or the threat of force, can solve all problems. I know you would respect my size and my strength, but I don't think there are many of you in this room who would quake in your boots if I threatened you with using force, and I think what is true of you is true of nations. Ours must never be a government of ultimatum. All people must know that we are slow to start, but hard to stop."", 'This afternoon I was in Portland, Maine, and I was reminded that the last President to visit Portland, Maine, was Theodore Roosevelt--a great President of another party who visited there in 1902. But what he said back there a half century or more ago is as true tonight as it was then: ""Speak softly and carry a big stick.""', 'In my country we are very proud of what we call the Texas Rangers. Sometimes when we have a little row or misunderstanding in our country, they call out a Ranger. One of our old cow puncher friends took some cattle up to Kansas City to sell, and one of the fellows out in the stockyards said to him, while they were waiting for the bidders to come in, ""Please tell me what is really the difference between a Sheriff and a Texas Ranger.""', 'The old man, a Ranger for many years, ran his hand through his hair and deliberated, and he said, ""Well, a Ranger is one that when you plug him, when you hit him, he just keeps coming."" And we must let the rest of the world know that we speak softly, we carry a big stick, but we have the will and the determination, and if they ever hit us it is not going to stop us--we are just going to keep coming.', 'Our military strength is vital to our security and it is very important to our influence. But it cannot and it must not be used to compel and to frighten all others into following our command and our every wish. Nor can it build the lasting framework of an enduring peace, because peace does not come from threats or intimidations, or humiliations, or overpowering. The only consequence of such a policy would be constant conflict, rising hostility, and deepening tension.', 'Force could not rebuild Europe. It took the vision and the statesmanship of the Marshall plan, and the patient molding of the NATO Alliances.', ""Force will not bring democratic progress to Latin America. It will take many years of the Alliance for Progress to create freedom's answer to false Communist promises. The ancient enemies of mankind thrive in that area of this hemisphere--disease, illiteracy, and ignorance."", ""Force will not bring an end to the arms race. We cannot coerce others to negotiate. We can't even compel them to be reasonable and wise. It takes skill and it takes patience, and it takes determination, and it takes a search for areas of common interest."", 'In the 10 months since that fateful day last November when tragedy cut our President down, and on a moment\'s notice, I had to step in and pick up and try to carry on for him, first, if you will remember, some of our soldiers were fired upon and killed in Panama, and there were those that shouted ""Move in with the paratroopers.""', 'Well, we went over to the Peace Corps and got one of our most skilled diplomats who had lived in Panama for years. We said to them, ""We will not negotiate with a gun at our temple. We will not sign a blank check to a treaty, but we will treat you fairly and justly. We are a big Nation and you are a small one, and we are not going to take advantage of you. But you are not going to take advantage of us.""', 'And we were criticized for weeks. But ultimately we reached an agreement on exactly the terms that I proposed the first day by telephone to the President of Panama.', 'A few days later Mr. Castro decided to cut our water off at our military base at Guantanamo. We were paying him for that water, and we were employing some 3,000 Cubans to do our work there. We were spending about $5 to $6 million a year with them. Suddenly and impetuously and impulsively, and I think irrationally, he cut our water off. The shout went up, ""Send in the Marines.""', ""I don't want the newspapermen to think f am quoting anybody now. But we let our coffee cool a little bit and we decided, for better or for worse, that it was wiser to send in one admiral to cut the water off than it was to send in a regiment of Marines to turn it on."", 'So we told Mr. Castro that we will make this base self-sufficient; we will make our own water. We cut off about $5 million worth of his exchange. Ever since he has been wanting to have a conference with us.', 'We had our troubles in Zanzibar. We still have our problems in Viet-Nam. Every day some one jumps up and shouts and says, ""Tell us what is happening in Viet-Nam and why are we in Viet-Nam, and how did you get us into Viet-Nam?"" Well, I didn\'t get you into Viet-Nam. You have been in Viet-Nam 10 years.', 'President Eisenhower wrote President Diem a letter in 1954 when the French pulled out of Viet-Nam, and said, ""We want to help you to help your people keep from going Communist, and we will furnish you advice, we will furnish you assistance, and we will furnish you equipment, if you will furnish the men, and if you want to fight for your freedom we will try to help you.""', ""New Englanders haven't forgotten it was less than 200 years ago when we were fighting for our freedom and people helped us. So President Eisenhower wrote that letter and he followed through on it. And President Kennedy followed through. And we have now had four or five governments in the last year. I can't tell you who runs the Government here, much less who runs it in Viet-Nam. As a matter of fact, I suspect some of you are going to have something to do with deciding who runs it here in November."", 'Now some of our people get awfully worried and talk about we have a crisis a week. Well, I wish we never did have a crisis. I would like to play with my radio or go to a football game, or go out in my speedboat. There are a lot of things I would like to do..', ""But if you just think we have a crisis a week you are optimistic. We have one a day. And the only thing you can do with them--you can't take an aspirin and get away from them--is you just have to take the best information you have got, take things as you found them, and make the best judgment you can under the circumstances."", ""Some of our people--Mr. Nixon, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Scranton, and Mr. Goldwater--have all, at some time or other, suggested the possible wisdom of going north in Viet-Nam. Well, now, before you start attacking someone and you launch a big offensive, you better give some consideration to how you are going to protect what you have. And when a brigadier general can walk down the streets of Saigon as they did the other day, and take over the police station, the radio station, and the government without firing a shot, I don't know how much offensive we are prepared to launch."", 'As far as I am concerned, I want to be very cautious and careful, and use it only as a last resort, when I start dropping bombs around that are likely to involve American boys in a war in Asia with 700 million Chinese.', 'So just for the moment I have not thought that we were ready for American boys to do the fighting for Asian boys. What I have been trying to do, with the situation that I found, was to get the boys in Viet-Nam to do their own fighting with our advice and with our equipment. That is the course we are following. So we are not going north and drop bombs at this stage of the game, and we are not going south and run out and leave it for the Communists to take over.', 'Now we have lost 190 American lives, and to each one of those 190 families this is a major war. We lost that many in Texas on the Fourth of July in wrecks. But I often wake up in the night and think about how many I could lose if I made a misstep.', ""When we retaliated in the Tonkin Gulf, we dropped bombs on their nests where they had their PT boats housed, and we dropped them within 35 miles of the Chinese border. I don't know what you would think if they started dropping them 35 miles from your border, but I think that that is something you have to take into consideration."", 'So we are not going north and we are not going south; we are going to continue to try to get them to save their own freedom with their own men, with our leadership, and our officer direction, and such equipment as we can furnish them. We think that losing 190 lives in the period that we have been out there is bad. But it is not like 190,000 that we might lose the first month if we escalated that war.', 'So we are trying somehow to evolve a way, as we have in some other places, where the North Vietnamese and the Chinese Communists will finally, after getting worn down, conclude that they will leave their neighbors alone. And if they do, we will come home tomorrow.', 'It is not any problem to start a war. That is the easiest thing in the world. I know some folks that I think could start one mighty easy. But it is a pretty difficult problem for all of us to prevent one, and that is what we are trying to do.', ""The second illusion I want to talk to you about is the illusion that the United States can demand resolution of all the world's problems and mash a button and get the job done."", 'In this nuclear age we have concern about the affairs of every continent, and that concern on some continents is increasing very much the last few days. That concern does not give us either the right or the responsibility to order the affairs of other nations. For example, two friendly nations, India and Pakistan, have been engaged in a long and often bitter dispute over the area of Kashmir. We are always ready to help. I have been out there and visited, and I have tried to take this ancient feud and pull these people together.', 'Most of the problems that we get in are ancient disputes that have been going on not for decades, not for generations, but for centuries among people--the Greeks and the Turks, the Pakistanis and the Indians.', ""Peaceful solution can mean much to the freedom of Asia, if we could only bring it about. But the responsibility of settlement must remain and should remain with these two nations involved. All we can do about two men that are arguing among themselves is to try to encourage them to settle their argument. We can't run in and get in the middle between a man and his wife because we will wind up getting hit. The same is true in many places throughout the world; independent nations with their own interests, with their own convictions, must work to settle their own problems."", 'We have willingly accepted the responsibilities of world leadership, and when our own vital interests are challenged we act. But we are not the sole captain of the ship.', 'Third is the illusion that we could, if only we tried hard enough, put an end to all difficulty and danger, and then retire from the world.', 'The sound of gunfire in Asia echoes in the homes of Manchester. The speeches of a leader in Moscow or Peiping help shape the life of a subway rider in New York. An angry cry for freedom in Africa requires an understanding act in Washington.', 'And as long as this Nation endures we are going to be engaged in the affairs of the world.', ""I welcome this involvement. I believe the American people welcome it. It may bring danger but it brings an added dimension to the prospects of freedom. In this world, as in life itself, there is really no escape from problems. You can't run away from them. No escape from peril."", 'Each of us in our own family faces continual change. We have our own desires-for a career and for more of the good things of life. These wishes often conflict with each other and with the wishes of others that we love. We must make constant compromise and we must make adjustment.', ""There are times that come when you have to decide whether the boy or the girl gets the car on Saturday night. There is no end to difficulties. We just can't wish them away or press a button or call on some general to solve everything for us. But we can hope to make progress toward a fuller and a happier life."", 'You have done that here in Manchester. You have done that in New Hampshire and in New England. You have done it in America.', 'In our own country, after two centuries-as a united people in an abundant land under a single Constitution--we still face great issues, and we still have difficult challenges. But we have made enormous, unbelievable progress.', 'How much more uncertain, then, is the life of the world? In six continents live over 100 nations. Some are far more ancient than our own. Others are barely begun. Some pursue hostile ambitions. Others are struggling for their survival. Some are flourishing and abundant; others desperately try to emerge from a poverty that is so bleak that it staggers the imagination.', ""So let no one tell you in this day and time that the problems of a world will be solved without sacrifice, and will be easily solved without years of effort. Because we just cannot ignore others. We tried to do it and two wars came as a result. Our future is tied to theirs. We can't abandon those who will not do exactly as we wish."", ""I remember one time when we were fighting an REA project in my State and I negotiated with the president of the power company for 2 days and I didn't make a bit of progress. He just sat there like a Methodist deacon and never gave an inch."", 'I was somewhat impulsive in my youth, somewhat erratic, and I finally got disgusted, and I said, ""As far as I am concerned, you can take a running jump and go you know where."" The old man just looked back at me as calm and restrained as he could be, and said, ""But I don\'t want to go there."" And all the board of directors came over and congratulated me on the fine speech I made and how courageous I was to tell the president of the power company to go to ....', 'Finally I went to one old lawyer who was wise and who had served me for years. I said, ""Senator""--he had been a Senator-""how did you like my speech?"" He said, ""Well, son, you are young in public life, and I hope you go a long ways. But the first thing you have to learn is telling a man to go to hell and making him go are two different propositions!""', 'So we cannot abandon those who will not do exactly as we wish. To do this, or to withdraw from the United Nations--and they have prevented almost 20 wars from getting started--to cast aside our commitments, would endanger freedom everywhere. And I think it would end the hope for peace. And it would certainly revive the fast fading Communist hopes for world empire.', 'I do not think that our future is going to be a simple one. But like all of those who sat in the White House before me, I believe it will be one which free men will welcome.', 'I expect victory. We are going to have victory. But it is not going to be a swift victory. It is not going to be the victory of arms, and it is not going to be victory of the grave. Our victory will come over many years as people choose freedom, as nations grow up and become mature, and as they learn independence.', 'Moreover, as the threat of war fades, that victory, I want to warn you tonight, is going to take great strength and going to take patience. It will take men willing to deal with the real events of a real world and not trapped by the dangerous illusions of fantasy.', 'But above all, it will mean that we must turn toward the world with the grandeur and the generosity of that American spirit which on this continent has already built an enduring home for freedom.', 'This has been a delightful day for me in New England. I have come here as your President to counsel with you about your country and your future.', 'I am the 36th President of this country, but until January 20th I am the only President that you have.

I cut the budget, after working 37 days and nights, $1 billion instead of increasing it $5 billion as we had been customarily doing on account of the increase in population each year.

If you came out to hear me talk about all the things wrong, you are going home sad, because there are some things wrong, but the things that are right outnumber them a great deal.', 'I am for things, instead of against them. I know what I am for. I am for uniting my country. I am for a nation of lovers instead of a nation of haters. I am for a nation of trusters instead of a nation of doubters. I am not for arraying class against class, or region against region, or religion against religion, or color against color--because we are all Americans.', 'I have a dream and I have a hope, and I want to see the day come, and I hope I can speed it, when every home can house a happy family, when every child will have a classroom open to him and a teacher to teach him all he is capable of learning.', 'I want a nation where the businessman is prosperous and expanding, and taking on new adventures, and where the worker has some leisure time and some social security.

We must be strong enough to defend America and that flag wherever it may be challenged, but we must not go around over the world rattling our rockets and threatening our bombs.', 'So realize that you have one of the most priceless privileges that human beings anywhere have. You have the right to vote. Now go exercise it November 3d. Go vote for peace and prosperity.', 'I could spend all afternoon recommending myself, but I am not going to do that.

Personal income after taxes has risen by $80 billion in 3 years and corporate profits after taxes have increased over $12 billion. The stock market has reached an all-time high. The value of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange are worth $100 billion more than they were when I took office last November. Total farm exports have increased 25 percent.', 'And in this great surge, Illinois has been one of the leading States of the Nation.', 'Illinois is today one of the top States in the Union, as Governor Kerner said, in exports to foreign nations--both industrial and agricultural exports.', ""Illinois today has one of the lowest unemployment rates of any industrial State in the Union, and I'll tell you who has been fighting to bring that about--your own great Senator Paul Douglas."", 'Illinois was the only industrial State that was able to reduce its public aid under Federal programs last year.', 'Illinois today has more men and women learning more new skills under the Manpower Development and Training Act than any other State in the entire Union.', 'In 1961 the unemployment rate in Illinois was 6.4 percent.

They say it ought to be voluntary. Even members of their own party say a voluntary plan would wreck social security, it would bankrupt the system.', 'Let me make this clear this afternoon, here in Peoria: This is one of the most important issues in this campaign. Americans are not going to gamble on social security. They are not going to risk destroying a program that has proved the bedrock of security for our older citizens.', 'And the position of Johnson and Humphrey is clear: We are going to fight for and strengthen and defend and protect social security, and we are going to extend it when the Congress meets again!

Working together, Republicans and Independents and Democrats alike, we shall go forward to the greatest goal: Peace on earth, good will toward men.', 'The road to peace is not an easy one. It is fraught with many perils. It has many side turns. There are no short cuts. But we move along it and we must move calmly. We must move patiently. We must move confidently. We must move with resolution, and above all, as good Americans, we must move carefully and responsibly at all times.', 'President Woodrow Wilson, one of our great Presidents, traveling through the United States, once said in the great city of St. Louis: ""Things get very lonely in Washington sometimes.

And neither am I.', 'The names of Kentucky live in American folklore. There is Daniel Boone, Casey Jones, and old Zachary Taylor. All of them drew courage from your soil. All of them were ready to seek the new horizons.', 'And this is the heritage of the great State of Kentucky that will not listen to those who want to tear down instead of build; listen to those who want to run from the future instead of face up to it; listen to those who retire behind old frontiers instead of being willing to open new ones.', 'I have come here this morning to the great city of Louisville to put that issue before the American people. The issue of this campaign is whether the American people are going to continue to move forward or whether they are going to stand still.', 'I want to talk to you a moment about your future, about the future of the Upper South, about the future of America.', 'The billions of dollars worth of new industry that TVA has already brought to the Upper South is nothing compared to the development that lies ahead. The Upper South is fast becoming one of the most exciting new industrial frontiers anywhere in America.', 'In 1929 personal income from agriculture was twice as important in Kentucky as manufacturing. But by 1960 manufacturing was three times as important as agriculture.', 'Between 1960 and 1963 the average personal income in Kentucky jumped 17 percent, and that is one-third faster than the rate for the other States in the Nation.', 'The unemployment rate here in Louisville has been cut in half since 1961. But this is not good enough, and it is only half the story.', 'Over 38 percent of all the families in Kentucky live today with an income of less than $3,000, and I tell you that if I am elected President of the United States, and I have a chance to serve this country for 4 more years, I am going to serve the 38 percent of Kentucky families that are in the poverty group.', ""One of the first things that we did after I became President was to get the Congress to pass the tax cut bill. That tax cut bill restored $12 billion in purchasing power to the American people. It created 24,000 new jobs for Kentucky. It generated an increase in total income in this State alone of $360 million. It boosted the State and local revenues by $29 million. It put $88 million extra into the wage earners' pockets that had been withheld."", 'And this is a powerful boost to the State of Kentucky. But it is not enough.', 'The poverty program will attack poverty on a scale that no government has ever attempted in all history. We are going forward to develop this Upper South in the years of opportunity that lie ahead.', 'First, we want maximum development of the entire Ohio River valley. This development will mean more industry. More industry will mean more jobs. More jobs will mean more income for the good families that live in this State.', ""Second, we are going to wipe out poverty in this region, in the rural mining areas as well as in the cities of Kentucky. When Franklin Roosevelt spoke to the people of this Nation, he said one-third of our people are ill dad and ill housed and ill fed--that was in the 1930's."", ""Well, I say to you today that we are very proud that we have moved that one-third down to one-fifth, but we have just begun to fight, and this Government, under my leadership, will never rest secure and will be as unsatisfied as a little boy's appetite as long as there is any poverty in our land."", 'Third, we want full development of all of our natural resources, development of our land, development of our water, development of our underground to improve the economy and the way of life.', ""Fourth, we want to continue the tobacco program, and by other measures insure small farmers a fair share of our Nation's general prosperity. We never want to go back to the farm-led and farm-fed depression days. We are never going back under my administration to any 10-cent tobacco."", 'We want to push forward our national economic programs that will continue our upward trend. We want every child born in this region to have a chance at the best education he can absorb. We want to improve and extend the social security system, and we are not going to make it voluntary, either.', 'We want to continue to help the people of the Upper South lift themselves by their own bootstraps. We want to help you realize the promise of this great region. We want to help contribute to the strength of the entire Nation. And until want, and misery, and despair are banished from every American home, I, as your leader and as your President, will not be satisfied.', 'Now, when we passed social security some people told us it was a ""cruel hoax."" When we passed minimum wages they said, ""It will wreck your political career."" When we passed our farm programs they said it was socialism. When we provided jobs for our men who were hungry to work, they said that was statism.', 'Well, those same old voices that said those same old things are now writing these same old speeches. Today they say ""halt"" and ""fall back"" and ""slow down"" and ""status quo."" The Democrats say, ""Put your hand on the throttle and full speed ahead."" Some of them say ""empty dreams."" We reply, ""Franklin Roosevelt and George Norris dreamed dreams and we built the TVA.""', 'Franklin Roosevelt was a Democrat. He came from New York. George Norris was a Republican. He was from Nebraska. But they worked together and they laid the groundwork for an industrial revolution in the Upper South. I am from Texas, and I am a Democrat. But I am first the President of all the people.', 'So here, today, in the great city of Louisville, in the happy State of Kentucky, I ask you to send us two more Democratic Congressmen to help us in the House, and I appeal to your two Republican Senators in the Senate to help us save the social security system, to keep us from selling TVA, to keep us from letting go down the drain all the accomplishments of the last 30 years.', 'No, we are not going to sit back in our rocking chairs and take it easy.

You know, the one thing that makes me so proud of my party, the one thing that makes me so proud of my friends, the one thing that makes me so proud of the people that wear these little LBJ hats and the red, white, and blue caps, is this: They are people of faith. They are happy people. They enjoy life. They like the South. They are good folks. They are not saying evil things about anybody. They are not slinging mud. They are not talking about their neighbors. They are not doubting the future. They are not worrying that socialism is taking over the country because we extend the hand of compassion to an elderly lady who has a social security check. They love people.', 'Yes, what makes our group so wonderful is that America is really, with a few exceptions-some people have had disappointments, some have had frustrations, some have gotten a little mixed up as they went along, but most of the people of America are people of great faith, with great religion, who love people instead of hating people. Most of your neighbors, most of your friends, most of the folks that you like the best are the folks that follow the Golden Rule, ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.""', 'So when you hear these bombshells and these explosions, and all these ugly things that you hear the last few weeks of a campaign, when you hear all these things I want you to keep your smile on your face.

I sat in every one of those meetings on the Cuban missile crisis, 37. I never left home in the morning that I was sure I would see my wife and babies when I got back that evening.

Mr. Eisenhower sat down and wrote the President of Viet-Nam after they were divided, after the agreements in 1954, and said to them, ""We want to help you help yourselves, and we will provide you advice and military assistance to preserve your country and keep the Communists from enveloping it if you will help yourselves.""', 'For 10 years we have been doing that, and sometimes it goes from bad to worse, and they have changed governments three or four times in the last few months. You know what a problem we have had here at home just changing it once and getting adjusted.', 'We are trying as best we can not to enlarge that war, not to get the United States tied down in a land war in Asia, and not for American boys starting to do the fighting that Asian boys ought to be doing to protect themselves. We don\'t want to pull out and come home and say, ""We will turn it all over to you.""', ""So if you don't want to enlarge it and you seek no larger war, and you don't want to pull out and run home, the only thing you can do is what we are doing. We let them know that when they shoot at us as they did in the Tonkin Gulf, we will make prompt, adequate, and sufficient reply."", 'So as we go into campaign now, we have those two big issues:', 'Do we undo everything we have done in the field of foreign affairs for 20 years in a bipartisan way? There are some that want to do it. Some are just frothing at the mouth to do it.', 'Do we want to junk all of the advances we have made in 30 years in social security, minimum wages, collective bargaining, education, roads, all these programs where we have worked together ? If you do, you can. But you will have to answer that on November 3d.', ""This State has always had a peculiar spot in my affection. Kentucky has done more for me than any State in the Union, I think, except Texas, and sometimes more than Texas. Even if at some time every Democrat in the State wasn't for me, I don't know any of them that really did anything against me or hated me. Most of them were for me."", 'I never forget your loyalty through the years in the House and Senate to Mr. Rayburn, when Fred Vinson was there.', ""When Fred Vinson put me on the Naval Affairs Committee against California, against Oregon, and against Washington, all of them that had a coastline, I wasn't within 400 miles of water. But if you had a Kentuckian running the Ways and Means Committee, you didn't have to have merit on your side. So that is where I got interested in military affairs."", 'I just want to say this to you: You are mighty good to come up here to breakfast and to be so attentive.', ""Mr. Rayburn went back home one time after he had been in the Congress 50 years. He went to the little place where he had taught school, where no one would take him in, board him. The banker, the preacher, and the rest of them didn't have room. But the old blacksmith gave him a place to board."", 'They all came around this night--when he was Speaker--and said they wanted him to go home and stay all night. ""No,"" he said, ""I\'ll stay with the blacksmith, if he invites me--old man James.""', 'So, sure enough, old man James came up--with his blue overalls on--and asked him to stay all night with him and Mr. Rayburn said, ""Yes.""', 'They went out and he said they talked until 2 o\'clock; about 1 o\'clock the wife and daughter went on to bed. Finally, Mr. Rayburn said, ""James, I have to make seven speeches tomorrow. I\'m in a campaign. I\'m going to have to go to bed.""', 'Old man James said, ""Well, Sammy, if that\'s the way you feel about it I guess you\'ll just have to do it. But I\'d like to stay here and talk to you \'til daylight.', '""Because,"" he said, ""Sammy, if the momma and the girls and me ain\'t your friends, it\'s just because we ain\'t got sense enough!""', ""That is the way I feel about all the people of Kentucky, regardless of any differences any of us may have ever had about anything: I would just like to stay here and talk to you 'til daylight, because if I am not your friend, it's just because I haven't got sense enough!""]",1

I honestly believe that is the second best introduction I ever had in my life. The best one was when the Governor was supposed to introduce me one time at Memphis and his legislature was in session and he didn't get to come, and I had to introduce myself."", ""The Governor told you that there wouldn't have been a Texas if there hadn't been a Tennessee. I agree to that, and I am proud of that. It just goes to show how much vision and foresight the people of Tennessee have always had, because Texas is back here today to tell you that we are not going to sell Tennessee, not for a dollar, not for a dime, not for anything. And if there are any would-be purchasers lurking around the corners over there four or five blocks away, I want them to know that the Johnson administration is not going to sell any other rivers in this country."", 'I want to thank my old friends Governor Cooper, Governor Browning, and Governor McCord for honoring us with their presence. They have all had distinguished careers in this State. They have come over here to appear at this meeting today. I was thrilled beyond compare when I spoke in Louisville and five former Governors of the great State of Kentucky united and came there and held up my hand. The reason there were more in Kentucky than there are in Tennessee is that Kentucky changes her Governors oftener. But I am grateful to these men for coming here to help me today.', 'I want to salute my old friend, one of the most courageous and one of the ablest Members of the United States Senate, Albert Gore. His voice is heard from one end of this Nation to the other, with respect, and with influence, and the only one that I know that fights harder and may have better judgment than Albert is his gracious wife Pauline.', 'I want to thank the people of Tennessee in advance for producing that fighting young man that you are going to send to the United States Senate, Congressman Ross Bass. Senator Herb Waiters has filled that seat with distinction, and he has always had a warm place in my heart and always will.', 'I want to thank my friend Joe Evins for coming here and leading me through these crowds today and pointing the way. I want to reiterate what my daughter Luci says, that there is no Congressman in the country that can make a better speech than Dick Fulton, and I am happy that he is here. Luci said, ""Daddy, if you would just keep this fellow Fulton in some other States like you did in Minnesota and Michigan, I think we would carry all of them."" And we are giving consideration to asking him to go into all of them.', 'I want to thank ""Fats"" Everett for coming here and helping me.

This is not my first trip to Nashville, and I promise you now it is not going to be my last."", 'The ties between Tennessee and Texas are pretty close. Some of my ancestors lived up here in Sumner County, your neighbor to the north. Sam Houston studied law in Nashville and served as Governor of Tennessee, and really bloomed out in Texas. David Crockett was born on a mountain top in Tennessee, but won his final glory at the Alamo in Texas. One son of Tennessee, one Texan that we never forget, was the closest friend that I ever had in Congress--Sam Rayburn of Rowan County, Tenn.', 'Another great man of Tennessee from Nashville did not go to Texas, but he did go up in the world and he became President of the United States. He was ""Old Hickory"" Andrew Jackson. I have heard it said that on the day he died, the family pastor was talking with one of the President\'s closest friends. ""Do you think that the General will go to Heaven ?"" the pastor asked. The old man thought a moment and replied, ""Well, if he wants to go, who is going to stop him?""', 'Well, it is men like that that have led Tennessee through all the years, and it is men like that that are going to lead and speak the voice of Tennessee in the future.', 'We are told in the scriptures that there is a time to every purpose under the Heaven--""a time to break down, and a time to build up.""', 'Well, I believe that this is a time to build up. And that is really the main issue in this campaign.', 'The issue is whether the American people want to continue to build our Nation on those policies and principles that have guided us for generations to new heights of greatness, or whether they want to tear down all that we have worked to achieve.', 'I came to Nashville today to talk to you about this. I think I know what the answer is going to be in Tennessee. But I will tell you now what my answer is going to be.', 'I am not going to do away with any of this forward program, and I am not going to sell the TVA. No matter how much they offer and no matter how much they want for it, and no matter what names they call it, I am not even going to sell the fertilizer part of it that they need. And I will tell you, I have a good reason.', ""In the first place, it doesn't belong to me. It belongs to the people of the Upper South. It really belongs to all the people of America. It is part of the blood and the bone of Tennessee. It is part of the greatness of America, and it is not for sale."", ""Some day, and you mark my prediction-I don't take pride in being a prophet--the time will come in your lifetime when these men of little faith and great fear who are marching around under another banner not of their forefathers, but another banner today, the blush of shame will come to their cheeks and they will hang their heads when they are told by their children that they supported a party that wanted to sell the TVA."", 'One of the first official acts of President Franklin D. Roosevelt was to send a message to Congress requesting legislation to create the TVA. Franklin Roosevelt did not do this because he was a Democrat. He did it because he was an American.', 'His strongest ally in the Congress was a Republican, Senator George Norris. Together they worked to give new life to the Upper South, and in those days, 30 years ago, we could only dream that TVA would some day come true, and that TVA would some day make this region bloom and hold its head high again.', ""Well, today that dream is a reality. A billion dollar industry has grown up along one short stretch of the Tennessee River-more than 30 new lakes with 10,000 miles of shoreline, with 320,000 acres being developed into parks and recreation areas, beautiful countryside, where the hornyhanded sons of toil at the end of the week's labor can take their Molly and the babies and let them have a little recreation and a little vacation of their own."", 'Yes, TVA is the great pioneer of the 20th century. It has shown what the Government and the people, working together, shoulder to shoulder, can do to conquer hostile nature and create a blessed home for the human spirit.', 'On November 3d the people of this Nation, I believe led by the people of Tennessee, are going to say, ""We are not about to tear all this down.""', 'The investment that we made in this valley has been repaid manyfold: low-cost water transportation has brought new industry; power has brought new industry; flood control has provided flood-free industrial sites.', 'In the last 4 years you have taken great strides, leaps, forward--faster, far faster, than the national average, and twice as fast as you did from 1956 to 1960.', 'The number of employed workers in Tennessee has increased almost twice what it did from the last Republican administration of 1956 to 1960. In Nashville, employment has risen by 24,000, from 1960 to 1963, more than three times the increase of the preceding 4 years.', ""Those steps forward didn't just happen. They weren't accidents. Our prosperity is not an accident. It is not a gift. We worked for it. We built it. We have earned it."", 'It is the work of the men of both parties, working together, faithful to free enterprise, resolving their differences, fixed on the common goal of American prosperity.', 'But today those principles are under attack, and I think that attack endangers you, because the same leader, the same voice, that talks about selling TVA, or parts of TVA, also says that we should withdraw from education at a time when the number of students in higher education in Tennessee has doubled since 1950.', ""That same voice says we should eliminate our farm program, and that would cut farm income from $12 billion to $6 billion. You folks that do business here in Nashville, and don't get out on any of these dirt roads, you wait until you cut that farm income from $12 billion to $6 billion, and you will see the biggest depression that is farm-led and farm-fed you ever heard of."", 'And they are going to bring it and put it right on your doorstep if you permit it to happen.', 'John Fitzgerald Kennedy said in the 1960 campaign that it is time to get America moving again. Since that campaign the profits of American corporations after taxes have increased more than $12 billion per year. Since that campaign we have reached the astronomical number of having 72 1/2 million people working on good payrolls. Those people are drawing today $60 billion more after taxes than they drew when John Kennedy made that statement.', 'America is moving again, and I resent those people who attack him, when he is not here to answer, and say they are going to do away with that program.', ""Eleven months ago, after that great tragedy, I was called to pick up on most short notice and carry on as best I could.

Uncertainty was in the air. Divisions had occurred."", 'The world was frightened and concerned, and we did not know what the next moment held for us.

How can we achieve peace?', ""Well, I will tell you one way we can't achieve it: by rattling our rockets, or talking about throwing our bombs around and defoliating areas. We can do it by building the strongest nation in the world with all the power that we will ever need to defend it under any conceivable circumstance, and I am here to tell you as your Commander in Chief today that we have that power. We are the strongest nation in the world; we are stronger than all of them put together. But that doesn't mean that we ever want to use that power. Just because we have a button here that will put off a blast over yonder is no reason you want to put that thumb on that button."", 'Here in Tennessee you conceived and you produced and you developed the most awesome and the most frightening and the most mighty power that was ever known to humankind anywhere in the world.

You have that strength in order that you will never have to use it.', 'I sat in 37 meetings of the National Security Council, with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Joint Chiefs in their gold uniforms, and the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the CIA and all of the great minds of this Government--37 long meetings during the Cuban missile crisis.', ""I never left home in the morning knowing whether I would see my wife and babies when I got back that night. You have read of it. But I don't know whether you have ever felt those chill bumps come up on you or not, but I am not one that can't say I have never been scared. I have been scared most of my life, ever since they took me snipe hunting when I was a kid and they left me out in the dark."", 'I was scared every moment that the Russians had their missiles there pointed toward this country. But I am proud to tell you that the coolest head in Washington during all that period was a man that is not here to answer the attacks on him today.', 'The coolest man in Washington was President John Fitzgerald Kennedy. And ben cause of his caution and because of his care, and because of the steel in his spine and the brain in his head, the American leader and the Russian leader were there eyeball to eyeball, and after that confrontation over a very tense period, when the chips were down and the thumb moved toward the button, both leaders decided that they could never in the eyes of God justify wiping out humanity.', 'And Mr. Khrushchev picked up his missiles and put them on the decks of his ships, and with our helicopters whirling overhead with their photographic machinery, he took them back home.', 'But ever since then the leaders of their country and the leaders of our country have thanked the good Lord that nothing worse happened, because what might have been would be too horrible to think of.', 'You are going to make the decision on who sits in those conferences that try to find a way and a means to peace in the world.

You have a little over 3 weeks to make up your mind and to help your neighbors make up. their minds. I am not an objective person to make a recommendation.', 'I am not going to be like the old Senator down in my country was, after the little boy picking cotton went off and stayed all afternoon. And he came back and the boss said, ""Where have you been?"" He said, ""I\'ve been over listening to United States Senator Joseph Weldon Bailey make a speech.""', 'He said, ""The Senator didn\'t speak all afternoon, did he?"" And the little boy said, ""Mighty near, mighty near.""', '""Well,"" he said, ""what did the Senator speak about all afternoon ?"" The boy said, ""Well, boss, I don\'t recollect precisely everything the Senator said, but the general impression I got from most of his remarks was, the Senator recommended himself most highly.""', ""You don't need any recommendation from me to know that the most important subject in the world is peace, and to know what you can do about it."", ""You don't need any recommendation from me to know what kind of a program we have been building together in foreign policy for 30 years, from the day that Harry S. Truman joined up with Arthur Vandenberg, a Republican, and gave you bipartisan foreign policy; from the day that Dwight Eisenhower took the Democratic Senate, led by Lyndon Johnson, and we cooperated for 8 years, when he met the Communist threat in the Strait of Formosa."", 'I am proud to say that even though I was criticized by some people in the country when I was Democratic leader, that I said, ""I am proud first I am a free man, second that I am an American, and third that I am a United States Senator, and fourth that I ant a Democrat--and in that order.', '""When the best interests of my country are at stake, if the President is right, even if he is a Republican President, I am going to hold his hand high and support him, because I think if you do what is best for your country, your country will do what is best for you.""', 'So during that period--I looked at the record the other day--in 1960, I voted with President Eisenhower, as the Democratic leader, 95 percent of the time on his foreign policy issues. And the leader of the Republican Party that year voted with him 25 percent of the time, and I think referred to his administration as a ""Dime Store New Deal.""', 'So I say to you that the one decision you have to make is what is best for you and your family. Can we meet the Communists, as President Truman did, with the support of both parties, in Greece and Turkey? As President Eisenhower did in the Formosa Strait? As President Kennedy did in the Cuban missile crisis? Or do we want to adopt some new, radically different departure and start off in another direction?', 'Well, I had a little trouble down in Guantanamo. A bearded dictator went in one day and said he was going to cut our water off at our base there. The first thing I heard was all these folks on the Hill started making recommendations, and one of them jumped up and said, ""Send in the Marines."" I was new in office and doing the best I could, and I wanted to consider what people had to say.', 'I called in the admirals, the generals, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, and we all talked it over. And we finally concluded that it would be a lot wiser if we sent in one little admiral to turn the water off rather than send in all the Marines to turn it on.', 'Now, you are going to be called upon to make some of those decisions in the month ahead. All I ask you to do is to remember that we have two big issues--peace and prosperity.', ""President Kennedy had a prosperity program going, and he left us with 51 bills to carry it out, and they hadn't passed the Congress. In 10 months that we went to work on them--I looked at them last Friday night and we had passed every one of the 51 bills in the Senate and all but 4 of them in the House."", ""I not only don't think you can have government by ultimatum abroad--I believe in trying to get along with the rest of the world--but I want our people to get along here at home."", 'I want business and labor to get along together. We have had less man-hours lost by strike than any comparable period in our history except during World War II. We have lost only 14/100ths of 1 percent of the number of hours worked due to strike. So we have business and labor, and the farmers and the Government all working together.', 'I want these businessmen and these labor men to get along together, because every time they make a dollar, I get 52 cents of it. And the more they make, and the more prosperous they are, the better off we are.', 'So we not only want peace in the world, we want peace at home.', 'When you go to the polls on November 3d, you vote for the man and for the party and for the principles that in your judgment will be most likely to bring to your family the peace that you have prayed for and the prosperity that you have worked for.', 'Thank you.']",1

They worked for a dollar a day. We had to give our wool away, and our cotton sold for 5 cents a pound. We had some things to say about the Government then, too. But it was a different kind of government then. And if it ever gets back in that shape again, I am going to have something to say about it."", 'But from what I read in the papers about what some of these fellows say about the Presidency, it looks like they are running against it instead of running for it.', 'I think what you ought to do with Howard is what we did down in my country one time. A little boy was picking cotton and he left in the middle of the day and he didn\'t show up until weighing-in time late that evening. The boss said to him when he came back, ""Where in the dickens have you been all afternoon?"" And he said, ""Well, I have been over to the Old Settlers Reunion."" The boss said, ""What were you doing over there?"" He said, ""I was listening to United States Senator Joseph Weldon Bailey make a speech.""', 'The boss said, ""The Senator didn\'t speak all afternoon, did he?""

We finally decided that it would be a lot wiser and more prudent to tell one little admiral to go over there and cut that water off than to send in all the Marines. And that is what we did.', ""And we told Mr. Castro we were going to make that base self-sufficient.

The pace has not always been swift. The course of human progress has not always been sure.

Man has the capacity to end human life or to end human want. Whether we reach these new shores of promise and opportunity, or whether we turn back and lose this great moment rests upon our unity of purpose, our unity of principle within our own society. We just must now draw ourselves together so that none can pull us apart. The will to heal must always overcome the willingness to hate. In the veins of America there flows the blood of many lands. We should cherish that diversity with pride, but we should jealously guard that diversity against any who seek to exploit it as the basis for our division.', 'The meaning of America for us all is opportunity. When divisions arise, when suspicions flourish, when hatred flowers, opportunity perishes and passes away. On this day, when we honor our heritage as free men and a peaceful nation, I ask of you, I ask all of you as Americans, that we pledge ourselves to stand up and to be counted for the best in America, because when you do what is best for America, you do what is best for yourselves.', 'So I hope you will always remember, I pray that you will never forget, that we should stand together for an America that knows no hate, that condones no division, that remembers no north or no south, or no east or no west, but steers its course only by the fixed stars of peace, of freedom, and of justice to all people. A great son of Italy made it possible for us to know about this continent and for us to meet here this afternoon in freedom. We are a nation of almost 200 million people in a world of over 3 billion people, so in the world we are outnumbered 15 to 1. If we choose to demand a decision based on language, we are outvoted; on population, we are a minority; on color we are just a small segment; but we prefer to be judged by one standard, and that is our love of freedom for all people. Congressman Rodino, Congressman Burton, Senator Salinger, and all the others here who serve with me in the Congress know that we are working together so that we can unite families, so that we can make it possible for some of our kinfolks to come here as our forefathers came here, so that we can continue not only to unite families but to unite countries.', 'Not long ago I was driving down the streets of Naples, and a young priest dashed and threw himself in front of my car.

The people want performances in the Presidency, not promises.', 'The people of the United States know, the people of the world know, that in these perilous, critical times the President of the United States has to be right the first time, and if he is not right the first time, there may be no second time for him to change his views or explain them or correct them, or there may be no time for the Nation to change its choice.', ""Out here in the West the people of your State and the people of all of these fine, progressive, prudent Western States want our country to pull together. They want a unified America. We do not have a Continental Divide on our opportunity, or on our progress, or on our unity. We want the young people of the West to have as much opportunity all their lives as young people of every other region have. We don't want them to have to leave home to find it."", 'We want the West to make progress as the whole Nation makes progress. We want life in America to mean the same on both sides of the Continental Divide, and that is our goal and that is our purpose.', 'These years ahead of us, the years between now and the end of this century, can be the best years of our national life. We can do the things that we have so long needed to do. We can bind up our wounds and heal our history, and we can make this great Nation of ours whole again. We can work to give States like your wonderful Idaho a full share in the strength and the future and the prosperity of our times.', ""Idaho's potatoes are wonderful, but Idaho can produce greater treasures for America in the lives and in the minds of Idaho's sons and daughters."", 'Here in Idaho and all across the West there are rivers and resources to develop. There is work to do. There are new jobs to create. There are better opportunities to provide for all the people.', 'The standard of opportunity must continue to rise for all Americans, whether they live in the large cities or the small towns; whether they live on the little farms or whether they live in the large States.', 'And our purposes can be accomplished if-if--we unite our country, if we stay strong to keep this Nation and keep the world at peace, if we do the works for our people which our hearts and our conscience have always told us were right, and if we do those works with prudence, with care, with caution, with an honest regard for the taxpayer, and with a full respect for our American heritage of thrift and frugality.', 'This year, for the first year in many years, I reduced the Federal budget $1 billion under last year. I did not do that alone. I did it with the help of President Truman and President Eisenhower, who came down from Gettysburg and spent several conferences with me shortly after I took office; with Secretary Anderson, a former Republican Secretary of the Treasury; with the Director of the Budget; with Mr. McNamara, the Republican Secretary of Defense; with Mr. Dillon, a Republican who is Secretary of the Treasury.', 'Together, we all felt that we must have prudent, progressive government. We must keep our eyes in the stars and have a vision of tomorrow--but we must keep our feet on the ground today.', 'My first budget went into effect July 1st of this year. The Congress just finished appropriating for it. The fiscal year starts July 1st. During the month of July, and during the month of August, we have just totaled the expenditures of the Government. During those 2 months we spent $676 million less than we spent last July and last August, a year ago. This July we reduced the Federal employees to the point where we had 25,000 less people working for the Government in July 1964 than we had in July 1963.', ""Idaho's role in this effort will be greater, and it will be more effective if you have as your voice in the House of Representatives the youth and the experience and the strength of this young man, Ralph Harding, who sits on this platform with us tonight. Comp White has done a wonderful job for this State, and I have no doubt but what you will want to return him to the Congress where he can work for you another 2 years."", 'They asked Mr. Rayburn, who became Speaker of the House, and who served in the House 50 years, and who both parties recognized as probably the most popular and most effective Congressman in that body-they asked him one time why it was that Texas had the standing in the Congress that it had. It had 8 chairmen of committees out of 15. It had the Speaker and the Vice President. It had the leadership of the majority party of that Congress.', 'Mr. Rayburn in his quiet, simple way, said: ""We have a little formula down home that we follow for our Congressmen. We pick them young, we pick them honest, we send them there, and then we keep them there. They grow in experience and they grow in seniority, and they grow in stature and they grow in understanding. As a result, they achieve the leadership that comes that way.""', 'That is happening to Idaho. That is happening to Idaho in the form of your eloquent and able young Senator and his charming wife who helps Frank do such a good job. I have always agreed with the people of Idaho on your choice of Churches. There is no Senator that Washington respects more, and none that the Nation needs more, and none that your President values more, than Frank Church.', 'On November 3d you have one of the most exacting obligations of citizenship. You have one of the greatest responsibilities that will ever come to you. It is just as important for you to live up to that responsibility as it is for your son to put on his uniform and fight to protect that flag when need be.', ""On November 3d, 70 million to 80 million people in this country, in accordance with Thomas Jefferson's view that the collective judgment of the many is much to be preferred to the individual decisions of the few, the collective judgment of 75 million people will be recorded that night by the computers of the Nation. And you 75 million will determine the type of leadership that you want to guide the destiny of this Nation for the next 4 years."", 'That day you will determine the man that you want to entrust the responsibility of our awesome military posture to. That day you will determine the man that you want to be your Commander in Chief, the man whose thumb will rest close to that button if it ever has to be touched; the man whose hand will have to lift up that ""hot line"" from Moscow if that phone rings and hear the voice on the other end.', 'You have an obligation to yourself and your children to select the person that you know is the most experienced, and the most capable of handling the future of your country and its citizens.', 'I did not come here tonight to tell you who that man is. You have intelligence enough to know in your conscience what you ought to do. I did come here to tell you that you must do your duty. Once you see it, you must get that job done, because the eyes of the world are on America.', 'The leadership of the world is in the hands of America. We are the richest, we are the freest, we are the most powerful nation in all the world, and the other 3 billion people look to us for example, and they follow it, so they know that the number one problem in the world is how do we live with other nations without destroying each other?', 'After Oak Ridge, we came into possession of the mightiest power ever known to the human race, and we are the steward and the guardian of that power.', 'President Kennedy sat at the head of the Cabinet table for 37 meetings during the Cuban missile crisis and, as Secretary Rusk said, Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Kennedy sat there eyeball to eyeball. Mr. Khrushchev had his missiles in Cuba, 90 miles away. But both men, after counseling for days with the ablest minds in their respective countries, concluded that it would be too horrible to contemplate to put your thumb on that button and wipe out 300 million lives in a matter of a few moments. So Mr. Khrushchev loaded his missiles on his ships and took them back home, and we breathed easier for a while.', 'Your Nation will face other crises in the days ahead, and in the time when it does, I know that you will do for whoever is your President at that time what you did for President Kennedy: give him your confidence, give him your strength, give him your prayers. I am proud to say to you tonight that I sat in all but one of those 37 meetings, and the coolest man in that room all the time was the man that you people had selected to lead you, John Fitzgerald Kennedy.', 'So when you go to make your choice, you will choose a Commander in Chief, you will choose a man that will try to find peace in the world, but will also try to find peace at home--peace between the farmer and the consumer, peace between the businessman and the laborer, peace between the manufacturer and the trade union. Because little good does it do us to become a mighty industrial nation if we waste all of our talents chewing on each other.', 'I am happy that we settled the railroad strike that had gone for 4½ years without a resolution.', 'I am happy that we today have the lowest number of lost man-hours due to strikes that we have ever had in the history of the United States, and that is because the businessman and the laboringman and the farmer are working together. That is because America has hope, America has faith, America does not live in fear and doubt. And that is why we have that good domestic record in this country.', 'So you will select the leader to find peace in the world, and the leader to find peace at home, and the leader to develop a program that will bring prosperity to our people. Today we have 72 million people working, more than ever before in our history, drawing higher wages than ever before in our history. Corporations made $12 billion more after taxes. Workers made $60 billion more after taxes.', ""So times are good, but we can't just sit back in our rocking chair and expect them to be good. You have to work to make them good. You have to plan to make them good. You have to be equitable and just and fair to make them good. And we are now doing our best on that job."", ""The day that I returned to the White House after that tragedy, I said to the American people, with God's help, with your prayers, I will do the best I can. I have done the best I could."", 'I have tried to be the President of all the people, of all the States in this country, and I hope that the good people of Idaho will join all the other States in the West and I hope a good many States in every section of the country, because I really want to know no North, no South, no East, or no West. I just want to know the United States of America.', 'I hope that on November 3d you will go and send us some good, experienced Congressmen back to Washington like Ralph Harding and Compton White; that you will vote the Democratic ticket for President and Vice President. And if you do, I give you my pledge that we will do our dead level best to preserve peace in the world, peace at home, and prosperity throughout this Nation.', 'Thank you and good night.']",1

The worst estimates are that we would lose two or three. But we are going to have a majority, or more than 50.

He has training. He has demonstrated ability. His experience in fighting crime, his great knowledge in the field of education and training of our children, his understanding and participation in our housing problems, his expertness in the field of defense and his intimate association with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense, his contributions in the all-important--the number one important--problem in the world, the area of peace, make him a most unusual and a most valuable and a most needed public servant.', 'The greatest aid that New York citizens can give to their country now is to make certain that Robert Kennedy and Democratic New York Congressmen are sent to Washington to work for a program for the people next January.', ""And you don't just send Bob Kennedy to Washington when you elect him Senator.

We intend to do something about these needs.', 'The Johnson administration, aided by your two Congressmen that you are going to select, and Senator Kennedy, will be guided by the principle that regardless of family financial status, education should be open to every boy and girl in America up to the highest level that he can possibly take.', ""A responsible government will do something about the conditions which foster crime.

And sitting there with him through the days and the nights that followed was his loyal and dedicated brother who gave him excellent and helpful assistance.', 'Now, we know that we will not keep peace by bluff, by bluster, or by ultimatum. Patience and strength are the road to peace. Understanding of why people do certain things and what our reaction must quickly be, are important considerations. These courses must be walked with vigilance.', ""I have no doubt that freedom is going to survive in this troubled world. I have no doubt that democracy is ultimately going to win. But we are not going to win it by quarreling with each other, by questioning each other's patriotism, or by mudslinging, muckraking, or getting personal with the men who are doing their dead level best in the interest of their country.

You just have 2 1/2 weeks now.', 'In that 2 1/2 weeks you cannot only come to these meetings, you not only can help Bill, Max, and Bob, and if you are really generous you can help Hubert and me a little bit as we go along--but you can talk to your neighbor. You can say, ""You have a big decision to make.""', ""You can put a bumper sticker on your car. I will bet you there are cars here today, and I will bet you Peter Crotty could get you a sticker some way to put on your car to let the people know that you are good Americans and you are really going to stand up and be counted November 3d. You would do it if we called you to war, so why don't you do it in peace?"", ""Eleven months ago, in the greatest tragedy in my lifetime, in a matter of moments, without any chance to talk to anybody or get any information, or go to a library, I had to become President, to carry on for the man who had faith in me and trust in me. I said to all of you that night on television that with God's help, and with your prayers, and support, I would just do my best. I have done my best."", 'President Kennedy left 51 programs for all Americans. This Congress had the biggest ever in any history--the test ban treaty, all those important bills, the tax bill, the civil rights bill, the works bill, education bills, the conservation bill, all for the good of each one of you. He had 51 pending. Last Friday night I looked over that list and somehow or other I thought he was looking over my shoulder wondering if I had done my job and if the Congress had done their job. We had passed every one of those 51 bills through the Senate, and all but four or five through the House.', ""Our friends in the other party wanted to go home and campaign and they wouldn't help me pass them through the House. But we are going to pass them when we get back there; that is, if you will help me, and give me men that will help me pass them."", 'A few months ago, about 2 years ago, we all met at the White House and looked at the pictures, and saw the Russian missiles in Cuba 90 miles from our shore. We had a lot of advice about bombs and invasions and sending in the Marines.', ""The President called every person that he could, including Republicans and Democrats from the Congress, Republican Director of the CIA, the Republican Secretary of Defense. They are all patriotic without regard to party. He tried to determine what he could do. He knew that he could mash a button and wipe out 100 million Russians in a matter of moments, and when he did that, they could mash a button and wipe out 100 million Americans. No sane man would want to mash that button and start that kind of an operation, but what else could you do? You couldn't sit there until the missiles were turned on us."", 'So we had 37 meetings, and I was present at 36 of them. Bob was present at all of them.', ""He and I sat on an Executive Committee of seven members, with a Republican CIA Director, Mr. McCone, with a Republican Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Dillon, with a Republican Secretary of Defense, Mr. McNamara, President Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Lyndon Johnson. And we considered everything, because they weren't just going to kill Democrats or Republicans."", 'This was America, and I am proud to testify to you today that it was one of the greatest things in my life.', 'Some people wondered why I ran for Vice President and quit the powerful majority leadership to help President Kennedy win over Mr. Nixon. I will tell you. I had all the satisfaction I ever needed when I sat in those meetings, because the coolest man at that table, the wisest man at that table, was John Fitzgerald Kennedy.', ""We had trouble getting adequate communications, adequate information, adequate knowledge. A man's knowledge and a man's judgment are no better than the information he has. But out of those meetings, both leaders decided that it would be foolhardy, when they were eyeball to eyeball, to put their finger on that button."", 'So Mr. Khrushchev pulled his missiles out of Cuba and took them back home, and he agreed to a test ban treaty. We celebrated the anniversary of it last Saturday.', 'I am talking on the television about it tonight. The milk that your babies drink is no longer as dangerous as it was before. The chance of having a deformed baby is no longer as dangerous as it was before. The food that you eat from our soil that was contaminated is no longer as dangerous as it was before. The danger of men becoming sterile has been removed.', 'The results are truly marvelous because we agreed not to test in the atmosphere, and 108 other nations agreed not to test, too. So I am going to tell you about the results tonight in that.', 'Out of that came the ""hot line"" where we can call Moscow and they can call us. And we can say, ""This is what we are disturbed about and you must not do that,"" and they can say it back to us.', ""You are going to decide which man, in your judgment, which party, you would rather have close to that button. You are going to decide which man you want to pick up that telephone when Moscow rings. You will never make a more important decision. It ought not to be based on how I look or where I come from, or how I spell my name or my ancestry. It ought to be based on what is best for your country and you and your children. I don't want it based on anything else."", 'So you go home today and you think about it, the alternatives that are open to you, and then you do what is good for your country. And you will do what is good for your party and what is good for yourself.', 'Thank you.']",1

That is Hubert Humphrey I am speaking of."", 'Over the last 24 hours, the meaning of this election has become clear. It is clear, as it should be clear always, that the destiny of a great nation is not to be determined by partisan consideration.', 'This generation of Americans stands face to face with the reality of our age. The world will not respond to the promises of politicians. It will not respond to the peeves of partisans. In an age of peril, when danger lurks across the land, the world respects and the world responds to performance, the effective performance, of a bipartisan system in the American way.', 'Strength we have, and strength we must have, and strength we will keep, and strength we will increase. But the strength of arms alone is not enough. We must show stability to match our strength. We must show steadiness to match our purpose. Only by strength and stability and steadiness can we lead the cause of freedom in the world.', 'This is the meaning of the last 24 hours. In that short span of time, the world has changed. In our oldest ally in the free world, the government has changed. I talked to the new Prime Minister of Great Britain on the telephone just before I left Washington.', 'In the strongest nation in the Communist world, the government changed yesterday.', 'In the most anti-American capital of the Communist world, the Communist rulers of the Chinese mainland have come into possession of their first nuclear device.', 'We cannot know the road ahead.

That is the reality of our age.', 'The course to be chosen in Moscow, the course to be taken in Peiping, the course to be pursued in the capitals of the free men around the world will be guided by the decisions that the Americans make on November 3, 1964, so be sure of what you do and be sure you know you are right.', 'In this year, as in all years, others will be reading our election returns. What they conclude from what they read may well decide the destiny of this decade, and the longer course of this century. There just simply must be no miscalculation. There simply must be no room for misinterpretation. The world must know on election night that America will not turn from the course we pursued.', 'Harry Truman faced the Communists in Greece and Turkey, and with the bipartisan support of Arthur Vandenberg, we won. Dwight David Eisenhower faced the crisis in the Formosa Strait, and with the support of Lyndon Johnson and Mike Mansfield, we won. Jack Kennedy faced the Cuban missile crisis, and with the support of Everett Dirksen, we won.', 'You will not be electing a President alone on November 3d; you will be electing the kind of life that you want to lead and the kind of world you want your children to grow up in. The vote you cast will count as much as the vote you do not cast, for if you fail to vote, your future will be chosen for you.', 'This is the season of decision for free men. Men who cherish their freedom and who cherish peace for their children and who hope for prosperous and peaceful tomorrows will not allow that decision to be reached by default. More Americans than ever stand firmly in the center. Our course is guided by the wisdom of experience and the goal of common purpose. We do not want to open that American center to attack or to division or to disruption from extreme factions on the fringe.', 'On November 3d, the choice of the American people can be a choice of promises or it can be a choice of performance. It can be a choice made in prudence or it can be a choice made in passion. I have no doubt what the American people want that choice to be.', 'The office of the American Presidency is a great and honorable office, created by a great people.

I have faith in them; I do not have fear of them.', 'I can promise and I do promise that I will give you all the strength that is mine to bind our wounds, to heal our history, and to make this Nation whole for the trials and for the tests that are ahead.', 'Some people say we are wild spenders, but in their hearts they know they are wrong. In my first 10 months in office, I cut the deficit in half. In my first 10 months in office, we reduced the budget under the last Kennedy budget by $1 billion. This July and August just passed, under this administration, the Government spent $676 million less than it spent in July and August of last year. We have cut the Federal work force of employees. Today there are 21,000 fewer Federal employees working for the Federal Government than there were the day I became President.', 'We are encouraging business and we are not harassing it. We know that the more prosperous business becomes, the more jobs are created, the higher wages can be paid to the workers. We have determined that this Government shall be solvent, this Government shall be secure, and this Government shall always be strong.', ""To do this, we must be fiscally responsible. We must watch every dollar so that we can get back a dollar's value for each dollar we spend.

I have known and served with many of them, but none have ever stood higher in my estimation than Brent Spence.', 'If your neighboring State of Ohio is the mother of Presidents, Kentucky is the father of great Governors. We had many of them together a week ago, and they demonstrated a great trait of Kentucky Democrats--the ability to unite. But one of the finest Governors of the land is your Governor now, my friend Ed Breathitt.', 'These are sobering hours in the history of the world. But there is no business anywhere that is more serious than the election of the leadership of the strongest nation on earth.', ""I had not intended to speak very long. At these airports you usually have a problem of people standing, the problem of planes flying, and the problem of not talking too often, too much, or if you do, you won't be able to talk at all. But I think I will tell you of a somewhat exciting day that I had this morning."", 'I was up at 6:30 and I read about 15 newspapers and all the reports that had come in overnight, and the morning cables. Then I went to my office, and we planted two trees on the White House lawn. It is customary for Presidents to plant trees when they live there, and we planted two trees that are oaks, that are grown both in the Atlantic seaboard and in my own section of the country. They grow tall and they grow straight, and they provide a good shade.', 'Then I visited for about an hour with the Soviet Ambassador, and he told me of the problems that exist in their country today, and the new government that has just taken over from Premier Khrushchev. One man runs the government and one runs the party. He assured me of the friendship of their people for our people and he wanted to make it clear that he was instructed by the new government to inform our Government that there had been and there would be no change in their foreign policy and their attitude toward us and their hope that we could, together, find some way to peace in the world, some way to reduce our armaments, and some way to relieve the tensions.', 'When I finished talking with the Soviet Ambassador, I met with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Executive Secretary of the National Security Council, and the Under Secretary of State, and we talked about the problems in southeast Asia, and our forces in Viet-Nam. We talked about the implications of the new government in the Soviet Union and why they had decided to change. We took all of the reports we had received and evaluated them. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State stayed on later, and the Security Council will meet tomorrow to further go into those problems.', 'We received complete confirmation that the Chinese had detonated a nuclear weapon today--at 3 a.m. our time this morning. It is a crude weapon, but it means another nation can contaminate the atmosphere, and it means in due time that they no doubt will have other weapons and will probably develop the capacity to deliver them. It is really a sad day for the Chinese people, because with all their hunger and their many untilled needs, they have to take their resources and put them into nuclear weapons.', 'I then went over and met with the leading educators from all over the country, and we signed one of the most comprehensive education bills in the history of this country. We talked about the great increased need of educated minds in our country, and how many people were unemployed because they had no specific training, and how in this space age, when the Soviet Union was sending three men into space, and when the Chinese nation has developed the nuclear bomb, how important it is for every child in this land to have all the education that he is capable of taking.', 'We finished with that meeting and I made a statement to a group of civic leaders of the Nation, and swore in Mr. Sargent Shriver, who is inaugurating a billion dollar program to drive out poverty in our land. The people that oppose it say it is not enough to do any good. The people that oppose it say it is too much to spend on people. So either way you go, you get criticized.', ""But as I was standing there getting ready to swear in Mr. Shriver, I thought of my experience as a young Congressman. We had women working in my district that made 7 cents an hour--in 1937. They tried to support their family on 56 cents a day. We introduced, in accordance with the President's recommendation, a minimum wage-maximum hour law. That law provided that the minimum pay per hour would be 25 cents an hour. It would be unlawful to pay anyone less than a quarter an hour."", 'There were only three men from my section of the country that signed a petition to force that caucus, and all three of us were told that we were ruining our political careers. That was in 1938--25 cents an hour. We were told that we would hurt labor, and we would hurt ourselves. The other two men that signed that petition with me and brought that question to a vote were defeated in the next July primary because they had sought to vote for a bill that paid 25 cents an hour. Now, think how far we have come since 1938.', 'It was about that same period that our great leader, President Roosevelt, who bore awesome responsibilities, concluded that we ought to try to do something about the poor people. He said a third of our Nation, one out of every three, was ill clad, ill fed, and ill housed. He looked forward to the day when he could reduce that percentage, and he did reduce it. That was 30 years ago.', 'In 30 years we have reduced it from onethird to one-fifth, from 33 percent to 20 percent. But there is still 20 percent of our people, I out of every 5 families, that live below the poverty line. Children born into those families grow up, become adults, unable to find a job, ill equipped, ill trained, and they become taxeaters instead of taxpayers. So we decided if President Roosevelt and his successors could reduce it from one-third to one-fifth, that maybe we could reduce it to one-tenth.', 'One hundred years ago, Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery in this country. It is almost unbelievable that we held people in bondage and we had our fellow human beings as slaves. But we did, 100 years ago.', 'And 100 years from now, I think your children are going to look back on the day when I swore in Sargent Shriver and say, ""It is almost unbelievable that 20 percent of our people lived in poverty."" Because just as Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery, we are going to abolish poverty in this country.', 'We want peace in our world. That is our number one objective. We want to learn to live with other nations. We want to be able to exist in a land where we don\'t have to worry about a nervous thumb moving up toward pushing that button that will wipe out 300 million lives. We don\'t want to sit there and listen to that ""hot line"" ring and the call coming from Moscow, and what they are going to say on the other end of the line.', 'We went through the terrifying and frightening experience of the Cuban missile crisis, when two men looked at each other eyeball to eyeball and finally Mr. Khrushchev had to pick up his missiles and take them home.', 'We want responsibility in foreign affairs like we have had for 20 years since World War II. Our friends in Western Europe have largely recovered. We are standing by our friends in Asia. We are making great progress in the Western Hemisphere.', 'Many nations have thrown off the yoke of colonialism and there is more freedom in the world today than there was 20 years ago. In all the new nations that have been born, I know you must take great pride in the fact that not one single one of them has embraced communism. The last nation that we lost to communism was Cuba in 1959.', 'We had a change of governments today in Great Britain. It fell my lot and my duty to call the Prime Minister of Great Britain and to welcome him for a visit and to talk to him about the problems that he will encounter and that will mutually confront our allies. So that is something about my day. The Prime Minister, I guess, went out to take his siesta and have his tea, and I came to Corington and Cincinnati and Dayton.', 'In addition to peace in the world, we very much hope for prosperity among our people. In the last week, I have seen more than 2 million people. Almost that many have scratched my hand. But it is a real invigorating experience, and it is a wonderful sight to look into the eyes of your bosses, the people that employ you, the folks you work for, the men and women who trust you, the ones who have faith in you and have faith in their country and have hopes for their future and their posterity. It is an exciting experience to be a leader in a democratic land. You want your people to be happy.', 'I have seen so many smiling, happy faces that the most dreadful thing that could happen to me would be to see a war come on or to see a depression come on. So today I gave instructions to my economic advisers to make a new study of how we could keep this prosperity going after next spring.', ""I may not need that study myself, as somebody else may be using it, but I think you have to think ahead, and I think you have to be optimistic for the future. I think you have to plan. I don't think you can just sit back and take things for granted."", 'I want to see the day when every man and woman who wants to work will have a job. I want to see the day when heart disease, cancer, and strokes will be banished and everyone can live to the ripe, old age of 100, and we are going in that direction.', 'I want to see the day when there will be a classroom for every child and there will be a qualified, well-paid teacher to man that classroom in this country.', 'The average manufacturing wage now is $104 a week, and we have 72½ million people working. There are less people that have lost time through strikes this year than at any time in our postwar history.', 'We had problems with the railroad strike for 4 1/2 years, we had those differences. But with the help of the good Lord, the leaders of both the railroads and the workers, we settled it. We had problems with the auto strike, but we have gotten most of those working out all right. We are losing only fourteen one-hundredths of 1 percent of the hours at work. Not 1 percent, not a half of 1 percent, but fourteen one-hundredths of 1 percent.', 'So we are proud of what has developed along that line. We have given back our taxpayers $12 billion that would have otherwise gone into the Treasury, so they could make new capital investments to provide more jobs, so they could have more take-home money. And, generally speaking, I think our folks on the average are doing well. We want to keep it that way. We think that the man that you select to lead this country and the kind of government you select will have something to do with not only peace in the world, but prosperity at home.', 'I have not come here today to say anything about any other choices or about my opponents. I have never felt that the voter cared very much about what one man thought about the fellow that was trying to get his job.', 'I have been in this business for a long time. My first campaign was for Al Smith when I was 20 years old. I am considerably older now, but for more than 30 years I have been going among the people and I have often observed that mudslinging and muckraking, and personal denunciations lost candidates more votes than it gained them.', 'So I have not come here for the purpose of telling you that Senator Humphrey and myself are the only two men in this country that are capable of leading these people. You people would do all right with just almost anybody leading you, because we have good citizens, and we have a good Nation, and we can weather these storms.', 'Look at what happened when our leader was stricken and fell, on the tragic day in November. Our people united. They pulled together--business, labor, women, farmers, groups all over the country--and we presented a united front to the world. We have gone forward. He left 51 bills behind him, and last Friday night I sat at my desk and I looked at the inventory and we had passed every one of those 51 bills in the United States Senate.', 'If you feel that we are worthy of it, if you think that we have the experience, if you think we have the head and the heart and the heels that these responsibilities require, we most earnestly solicit your support on November 3d.']",1

We could point to a spirit of Christian compassion such as the world has never seen, and prove it by the tons of food and clothing and billions of dollars we have provided as gifts in saving hundreds of millions of people overseas from famine, and many governments from collapse ....', '""We could point out that our American system has achieved the greatest productivity, the highest standard of living of any nation on earth. True, we have large natural resources--but other nations also have such resources. What, then, has brought us such abundance?', '""We have freedom of choice. And the produce of our freedom is the stimulation of our energies, initiative, ingenuity, and creative faculties. Freedom is the open window through which pours the sunlight of the human spirit and of human dignity.""', 'Thus said a great President who has passed on.', 'Now, in this campaign, you will have a decision to make. Two weeks from yesterday you will go and select your leaders for this country and the leaders for the free world for the next 4 years.', 'You have two issues that stand out: Shall we continue the foreign policy of bipartisanship, where Senator Arthur Vandenberg, a Republican, worked with President Truman, a Democrat, to stop the Communists in Greece and Turkey?', 'Shall we follow the bipartisan policy of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who worked with Lyndon Johnson, a Democratic leader of the Senate, in the crisis in the Strait of Formosa, when our country was united and we put our country ahead of our party ?', 'Shall we follow the policies of Senator Dirksen and Senator Hickenlooper, who worked with John Fitzgerald Kennedy in the Cuban missile crisis and in the test ban treaty?', 'Or shall we go off on another adventure to fly to evils that we know not of on a very dangerous course?', 'You will decide that course.', 'In our domestic policy, unemployment in this State is at an all-time low. Income is at an all-time high. Corporation profits after taxes this year are up $12 billion. Workers income after taxes this year is up $60 billion.', 'Yes, in the words of our great President, this country is moving again. That is what John Fitzgerald Kennedy predicted and that is what we are doing.', 'So now I must run along. I leave that choice up to you. I hope that you will be understanding. I hope that you will do your duty. I hope you will realize your obligation. The spotlight of the world is on America on November 3d. They are going to look to us for leadership.', 'We have new governments in Germany, England, in the Soviet Union, Italy, and other places. They have seen the transition that has taken place since President Kennedy was taken from us. They are looking to see what kind of leadership you are going to select.', 'Well, I will tell you what kind you are going to select. You are going to search your conscience and regardless of what party you belong to, you are going to do what your conscience tells you is best for your country, and whatever your decision is it will be satisfactory to Hubert Humphrey and to me.', 'Thank you very much.']",1

After meeting her, I guess you know why I think the country needs more women in public affairs. There is something that you can do about that.', ""I don't know how much time you have, but there are just a few days left. You have a highly intelligent, gracious, charming, effective lady that would be delighted to come down to Washington and competently help your President with a program for all the people of this country. Her name is Fran McGovern."", 'Now, Fran McGovern has been working with us on the Employment Security Council. We need her down there to work with us on our program. She will listen to the testimony, she will analyze the bills, and she will vote for all the people. She won\'t just vote ""no"" automatically when the roll is called.', ""One good turn deserves another. She has been a former member of your Ohio Legislature.

I understand that unemployment in Akron was something over 6 percent 3 years ago. Now we have it down to under 3 percent. I want to find out how you have done it, because we are going to get full employment-and I mean full employment--in the entire country.', 'The tax cut bill that we passed earlier in the year is going to help some. It means another $651 million for your own use here in Ohio. It means $37 million in the Akron area alone. It means more jobs.', 'And I have also been looking into some of these Federal-local partnership projects before I came out here. We have been working together now for 3 1/2 years. You have three new urban renewal programs. You have two college housing act loans to the University of Akron, one of the finest institutions I know anywhere in the country. It produced your great mayor and it produced your next Congressman, and we are all thankful for that.', 'We have 421 beds in the City Hospital, St. Thomas Hospital, St. Edwards Nursing Home, under the Federal legislation, the Hill-Burton Act.

I want to appeal to your intelligence and not to your emotion.', 'I must say a time or two when I have turned on a television spot or have turned on my car radio, I have heard some rather uncomplimentary comments about the President, and for a moment it distressed me some. But when I got back home and I looked back over what they had said about Washington, Jefferson, Jackson, Abraham Lincoln-Abraham Lincoln said he went back to his hometown and no one there spoke to him except one woman and she seemed to wish she could have avoided it. I remember what they said about Wilson, Roosevelt, Eisenhower, and Kennedy.', 'So I think the best thing we can all do is try to look at our problems, analyze them, see how we can try to solve them together, and hope that our people will stand together and unite during a period when we need the best that is in all of us.

Instead, we discussed ways to make our relations with the new Soviet leadership more productive.', 'No one advised me to withdraw from the United Nations. Instead, we talked about the need to strengthen it.', ""No one advised me to make threats or issue ultimatums, or to talk about lobbing one into the men's room in the Kremlin.

I think I know the American people are not going to junk the bipartisan course of 20 years and fly to evils that they know not of on a dangerous adventure that they know not where it leads.', 'Sunday night I talked about the problems of the world on television. More than 63 million Americans listened to that discussion. The great majority of them are, I think, united behind the responsible foreign policies of this country that have kept peace for us. I believe that they are going to choose those policies on November the 3d.', 'What is the real foreign policy issue of this campaign ?', 'The issue is whether we will use our great power with judgment and restraint.', 'The issue is whether we will continue the long, the hard, the patient search for a lasting peace.', 'I intend as your leader and as your President to work to strengthen the United Nations, because I think they have prevented a number of wars already, and I think they can help us on the road to peace in the days ahead.', 'The United Nations, with all of its defects, has been a source of many achievements for peace and for the dignity of man.', 'I will continue to work to find areas of common interest with the Soviet Union.

We have these brilliant scientific geniuses from several countries working with us to find that answer. We have already gotten it down where we can produce it for less than $1 a thousand, but if we can get it down to where we can produce it for 25 percent of that amount it will be a great victory for humanity all through the 3 billion people in the world.', 'I intend to pursue goals of this kind. I intend to submit new proposals in Geneva to slow down the arms race, and to lessen the tensions and lessen the danger of war. And I hope that we can get agreements from other nations to do the same thing. We are going to keep on trying.', 'I can assure you that your country is the mightiest nation in all the world.

We will give you advice, we will provide leadership, we will help you with material things, with your weapons and the things that you do not have, to protect your independence because we are so proud of our independence we would like for you to have independence, too, and not be swallowed up by the Communists.""', 'We have been doing that for 10 long years under three Presidents. We have now some 18,000 men in Viet-Nam, officers and men, advising, counseling, leading them. We have a good deal of material that we have sent there, very costly to our taxpayers each month. The reports that come in are gloomy from day to day.', 'But we have a choice. We can seek a wider war. China is there on the border with 700 million men, with over 200 million in their army. And we could get tied down in a !and war in Asia very quickly if we sought to throw our weight around. Or we could retreat and pull out and say ""Goodby"" to the rest of the world, that we are going to live on our own shores, and we would let Asia go to other people. But we don\'t seem to think that either of those alternatives is the wise decision.', 'We are going to continue to try to make these people more effective and more efficient, and do our best to resolve that situation where the aggressors will leave their neighbors alone, and they will finally learn to live together in peace as they have in other parts of the world.', 'So we are going to assist them against attack as we have. We will work to help them achieve progress and self-confidence. We will not permit the independent nations of the East to be swallowed up by Communist conquest.', 'In the developing world, the great continents, other continents, that we are interested in--Latin America, Africa--we have only a single goal. What is that goal? America does not seek slaves or satellites. We do not seek domination or dominion. We only want those countries to live in freedom and independence. We want them to be strong enough to resist the aggressions of others. We want to help them meet the needs of their people for food and shelter and education.', 'These are some of the policies that we have followed. They are the policies we are going to continue to follow.', 'The White House has a very special atmosphere when great events are happening, as they happened all last week. As I sit in my office late in the evening, at night, I am very deeply conscious of the immense powers that this Nation commands.', 'So this great power cannot be put into the hands of those who would use it either impulsively or carelessly. We must constantly be deliberate, prudent, and restrained. Before we shoot from the hip, as Mr. Rayburn, the great political leader, used to say, the three most important words in the English language for everyone are, ""Just a minute.""', ""So let's say to the rest of the world that the world's hope for peace cannot be left with those who really have no faith in the possibility of a lasting agreement, and who really predict war. The future of man should not be entrusted to those who would tear down the institutions and policies which a threatened world has carefully built for its own protection."", 'That is our central concern. It is also the concern, I think, of a watching and worried 3 billion people in other parts of the world.', 'But we will not have peace just because we desire it, not just because we want it. There is only one road to peace, and that is to work at it, patiently, deliberately, wisely, step by step, year by year, never to become reckless, never to become weary of the journey and irritated with folks who may not agree with you the first time you talk to them. That is the course, I think, that we should follow, the course of the prophet Isaiah, ""Come now, let us reason together.""', 'Here are two great powers. When they put their thumb on the button, they can kill 100 million Americans in a matter of hours. When we move our thumb up on that button and sound the alarm, and the bell rings, we can kill 100 million Russians in a few hours. A total of 300 million people could be wiped out from daylight to dark.', 'But that is not the kind of world that you want to live in. So the prophet Isaiah says, ""Come now, let us reason together.""', ""And I say to all the world that we are a mighty power, but we don't brag about it and we don't throw our weight around. We have more strength and we are going to maintain it, at great sacrifice from our taxpayers.

Our guard is always going to be up, but our hand is always going to be out."", 'The leadership, the responsible leadership, of both parties in this country--and I believe in the two party system. And that is why I so earnestly want every person to go and vote his convictions so all can see that there are not many people who approve the temporary captivity leadership of the present Republican Party of extremes. And we will be voting for a strong two party system on November the 3d.', ""When they pass on these extremists, the men who booed others at San Francisco, the men that are intolerant of others' opinions, the men who speak off the cuff--when they act decisively on their judgment, then there will be a new group of moderate leaders come in and build a stronger and a more effective Republican Party."", 'But we will always maintain our bipartisan cooperation, and together we will do what is best for America, because when you do what is best for your country, you do what is best for your party and for yourself.', 'So the hour is here, the clock is ticking, the calendar is moving. You have a privilege that millions in other countries are denied. You have a right, an obligation, and a duty to see that you and yours go to the polls November the 3d and select the leadership that in your judgment most nearly represents the best interest of this country.', 'I am not going to discuss individuals in this matter. That is a decision you can make for yourselves by listening to the radio, seeing the television, reading the morning newspapers.', 'I am very happy that the college permitted me to come here today and have free speech. This is a great university and I treasure this invitation.', ""I am also mighty grateful to the Akron paper for their endorsement yesterday. I must run along because I can just intuitively feel Mrs. Johnson getting ready to send another note up here.

I said my philosophy many years ago: I am a free man first, I am an American second, I am a public servant third, and a Democrat fourth--in that order.', 'We must not be complacent about what is happening in the world. We must not be complacent about what is happening at home. You have a duty to do, so go do it in accordance with the dictates of your own conscience.', 'I saw a poll coming down here this morning. It showed that I had most of the Democrats and had 30 percent of the Republicans. But that distressed me, that I only had 30 percent of the Republicans. Those are good people if they get the truth and if they get the facts, and we have to improve that situation between now and November the 3d.', ""So let's all put our shoulders to the wheel and unite instead of divide, and again in the words of the prophet, let's go out and reason together."", 'Thank you.']",1

One of the great regrets of my life is that in a moment of temporary misunderstanding, he was confronted with some of the same forces that confront me today. I am so happy that you people that are proud to wear the label of the Democratic Party in this State are going to send Joe Tydings up there to take his place.', 'Mayor McKeldin, you did a very unusual thing when you, as mayor of this great city, came out to the airport tonight to welcome me. I will always remember it. I think you came perhaps for two reasons:', 'One, you are a courteous and hospitable man who speaks for all the people of this city, and when the President of this country visits this city, you want him to be welcome, regardless of what party he comes from.', 'But secondly, I think you came because you genuinely believe that the present President of this country is trying his dead level best to do what is best for this country, regardless of party.', 'Mayor McKeldin, I want to make a personal pledge to you tonight.

Here in Tennessee, you developed the awesome and mighty power that makes us the undisputed strongest nation in all the world.', 'Let me remind you that by two men exercising their bad judgment and putting their thumb on the button, that you can, in a matter of moments, wipe out the lives of 300 millions of people as a result of your mighty discoveries at Oak Ridge.', 'Let me remind you that on this election day of November 3, less than 2 weeks from now, all the world of 120 nations and 3 billion people, of which we are just one-fifteenth, are going to be watching you as Americans and watching your vote. The election returns will be read in the capitals of the world--the free world and the Communist world.', 'I want the mandate of this election to be written loud and strong, and clear, so that none, anywhere, will mistake the meaning. We have Chancellor Erhard in Germany. We have a new British labor government just selected this week. We have General de Gaulle in France. We have Mr. Shastri in India, who succeeded Mr. Nehru. We have the new rulers in the Kremlin.', 'I want them and all the world to know what campaigns of hate, campaigns of fear, and campaigns of smear--I want them to know that we Americans are proud that we have faith and hope, we have love in our hearts, and a campaign of smear cannot succeed among the American people.', 'I want them to know that when they deal with Americans, they deal on the basis of reason and judgment and not on the basis of hate or emotion.', 'I want those who wish us well to know that America stands strong and stands steady, and stands firm, using its great power with great restraint; always ready to meet any aggressor, but always ready to search for an honorable peace.', 'I want them to know that the mightiest nation in the world, supported by the strongest, most patriotic loving people, always have their guard up to protect themselves, but always have their hand out to find a workable peace.', 'I want the mothers who must supply the boys, and I want the boys who must die in the wars, to know that no impulsive act of mine, no heat of emotion, is ever going to cause me to do a rash, dangerous, adventurous thing that might wipe out 300 million Americans.', 'I want any who may wish us ill to take notice this morning to understand that our beloved America cannot be divided by region, by religion, or by race.', 'And I want the country to know and the world to know that we are going to preserve law and order in the streets of America, and we are going to preserve reason and responsibility in the policies of the Government of America.', 'In our land and around the world, America is going to stand proudly and confidently for the pursuit of peace and progress, freedom and justice for all mankind.', ""That is your duty, that is your obligation, that is the price you must pay for the privilege of being Americans.

Exercise your citizenship now, because it is your boys, it is your lives, it is your families that you must have led, and you must select the leader for them November the 3d.

I am going to Chattanooga, and I am going to Baltimore, and I am going back into Washington tonight, and to Florida and Georgia tomorrow, and all across this land all next week.', 'I am not going to talk hate. I am not going to preach doubt. I am going to try to appeal to the best that is in us all, because I think men, regardless of their religion, their politics, their race, or their region or their party--I believe they want to do what is best for America. And that is all I am going to ask any American to do.', 'Eleven months ago, on a tragic day, a moment that I will never forget, without notice or warning, my constitutional responsibilities required me to assume the awesome responsibility of being your leader, and to try to effect a transition between a dear, beloved leader who had fallen, and to demonstrate to the world that was watching that it was our system that would function, that we were a nation of laws and not just a nation Of men,', 'So that night when I walked into the White House, as Governor Clement said to you, I said to the American people, ""With God\'s help, with your prayers, I will do the best I can.""', 'Under our democratic system, in less than 1 year from that day, you must decide whether I should step aside and whether I should move over, and whether you should have another leader.', 'That is your right and that is your privilege and that is your duty, to decide. All I can say to you is this: Whatever your decision is, I want it to be based on no emotion, no flattery, no religion, no race, no region of the country. I want it to be based on qualifications and experience and merit.', ""But really, what it all adds up to is I want it to be based on your conscience, whatever your heart tells you is right. You don't develop character, integrity, and leadership by bragging about it and pointing to it. You don't develop and do what is right by saying so on a billboard. A great man said one time in a great public speech that men don't talk about their integrity and women don't talk about their virtue, if they have it."", 'So in this hour of trial, ask yourselves what is best for free men, what is best for Americans, what is best for Memphis, and Tennessee, and Mississippi, and Arkansas. And then ask yourself, ""What is really best for me on the only two things that are really important, survival and prosperity, peace in the world and peace at home?"" Ask yourself that question. Free men, Americans, Tennesseans, and then yourselves, in that order.', 'And whether you are Democrats or Republicans, you go in that polling booth and do what you know is right in your heart.']",1

So let him help you make this a greater State.', 'Congressman Billy Matthews and Congressman Charles Bennett are the kind of men who have helped make the Florida congressional delegation one of the most respected of all the States in the Union. Congressman Billy Matthews and Congressman Charles Bennett--Congressman Bennett has earned the gratitude of Jacksonville and his Florida neighbors especially for his work in making the cross-Florida barge canal come closer to reality.', 'I am glad that one of the first acts of my Presidency was to include in a budget an item to begin the cross-Florida barge canal which someday will mean so much to all the people of this great State. Charlie Bennett has been my good friend and my helpmate. And all the Members of your delegation have always been reasonable and fair in dealing with us.', 'The members of your State cabinet have earned my gratitude by their endorsement: Tom Adams and Ed Larson, Tom Bailey and Doyle Conner, Ray Green and Jim Kynes. And I want to say this to you: that I earnestly believe that a week from tomorrow, when the polls from all the Nation come in, and we call the roll of States, I believe the progressive and the proud and the thinking people of Florida are going to put Florida in the Democratic column with Johnson and Humphrey.', ""In the audience today are many municipal leaders from all over Florida. I am mighty pleased to see them. The source of America's strength emerges from the kind of leadership that we have in our cities and in our towns. Nowhere, I think, is this stronger than it is in the State of Florida."", ""I was thrilled to hear of the good women of this community coming out to the coffee this morning and joining with the lovely Miss Ann Sheridan, who came here, and I am happy that she is here with us today. She is visible evidence of the beauty and the charm of Texas women. I would like the press to note that at this point in my speech I also said that Texas and Florida women are among the Nation's fairest!"", 'I take pride in welcoming to this platform Mrs. Annette Baker and Tom Fleming, and Warren Goodrich and Lacy Mahon.

I have not come here to muckrake, or to mudsling, because when you have no issues to talk, you can always resort to that.', 'But in this campaign, you have only one big issue, and that issue is this: Whom do you want to lead America? What party and what person do you think gives you the best opportunity and is likely to give you peace in the world ?', ""To understand what this election means for our future, let's just look for a moment at our past."", 'This country is less than 200 years old. That is a very short time in the life of nations. In that moment of time, America has created the greatest success story in the history of the world.', 'Our wonderful democracy has spread to dozens of other countries. Everywhere men hope for freedom. The words ""Give me liberty or give me death,"" the words ""All men are created equal,"" are on their lips and are in their hearts.', 'And this success rests on many pillars. And none more important than the fact that our great political parties have always represented varied interests and the broad, common judgment of the American people.', 'I have been in political life for 35 years and I have observed that neither of our parties have spent much of their time preaching hate and preaching division. They have not stood for extreme views or narrow opinions. They have never asked us to tear down the institutions and the achievements of the past.', 'I remember, as you must remember, the campaign of Wilson, the campaign of Harding, the campaign in more recent years of Roosevelt, and Truman, and Dewey, and Kennedy, and Nixon. But none of these men tried to split our country wide open. None of these men preached hate. None of these men preached division.', 'Today, for the first time since the Civil War, there is some division in our land, there is some hate in our land. For the first time, the next chapter of the American success story is in question.', 'For under the wild charges and the impulsive statements of the opposition is hidden a deadly intention that would initiate policies which I think would radically change the American way of life.', 'Our peace is at stake. Our prosperity is at stake.', ""In the past 4 years the income of the people of Florida has grown at twice the previous rate. You have built roads that increase tourism and commerce, and this cost $100 million last year. We helped small businessmen keep alive and thriving, and this cost $10 million last year. We made social security payments--they weren't voluntary, either--to some 600,000 older citizens of Florida, and this cost a half billion dollars last year. We helped to provide lunch and milk for a half million schoolchildren, and this cost us $10 million in Florida last year."", 'The story is the same for schools and hospitals and training programs. Our tax cut will boost your economy. Our fiscal policies have cut unemployment and raised production.', 'And today we are told that Government must abandon many of these programs and turn them out and back to the States. We are told that we must abandon education; we must make social security voluntary; we should sell the TVA and get rid of public power; we should forget our farm programs.', 'Well, these are the most radical proposals that have ever been made to the American people.

We are the mightiest, we are the strongest nation on earth.', 'Our determination is not the issue. We are ready to defend freedom whatever the risk.', 'Patriotism is not the issue.

They, in my judgment, are the highest stakes ever presented to any generation of Americans.', 'A great American party has fallen into the hands of a narrow and an extreme group. They ask you to tear down the past. They ask you to take unnecessary risks with your future.', 'There is now, in my judgment, only one course: We must Tuesday week go to the polls and crush this threat to American life. We must restore the health of our two-party system. We must get on with the work of building peace in the world and peace at home.', 'We must stop this business of talking about each other and quarreling with each other. We must love thy neighbor as thyself. We must preach love and not hate. We must preach unity and not division. We must preach equal opportunity for all Americans and special privilege for no Americans.', 'We are already the mightiest nation in the world. We have a foreign policy that is tested, that has brought together most of the leaders of both parties. We have a fine space program in which Florida is leading the rest of- the Nation. You have a great cross-Florida canal that we are just starting. We have much work that is yet to be done.', 'Today we have more people working than we have ever had before. They are drawing better wages than they have ever drawn before. Seventy-two million people are working; $104 a week. The businessman and the laboringman are not fighting each other. They are not hating each other. They are working together.', ""This year we lost less time by strikes than any year in our history except in the middle of a war.

We lost fourteen one-hundredths of 1 percent."", 'I am so glad that I sent a message just 2 or 3 days ago and General Motors and UAW have finally settled their differences and they will all be back to work soon. What does this do when we reason together, as the Good Book says, instead of divide? The corporations of the country this year made $12 billion more after taxes than they did last year. The people who worked for those companies made $60 billion more after taxes than they made last year.', ""So why do we want to endanger the system that has taken us 30 years to build, with unemployment compensation, with social security, with the development of our resources, with our fine space program, and let it all go down the drain in a moment of an election year? I don't think you are going to do it."", 'I repeat: There are just two issues--and only one real, important one, and that is peace in the world, because if we get wiped out with an atomic holocaust there won\'t be anybody here to have any prosperity.

You go out and you enlist to defend that flag and to protect that flag."", 'Twice in my lifetime we have taken it around the world and brought it back without a stain on it and we are going to keep the defense that will assure we can do it again.', 'Before I close, I want to thank and welcome some of these folks over here of another philosophy. You know, at nearly every meeting we have they send some of their children over to visit with us, and we like for them to be here where they can see happy, smiling people. We like for them to know that we have no fear in our hearts and no hate in our souls.', ""I am really hoping that come election day a good many of these people that have exposed themselves to happy Americans with hope and faith and trust in their country-that they will get rid of their bad feelings and come and join us because the wonderful thing about this question of peace is it doesn't make any difference whether you are Democrat or Republican, if you have a nuclear holocaust, you are gone."", 'And in this campaign from Maine to California, I have found 30 and 40 percent of the Republicans have come over and joined us in a program for all the people regardless of party.', 'I think you ought to know here, in closing, that most Americans think more of their country than they think of their party.', ""So I will leave you now. I haven't said anything unpleasant or critical about any personality. I want to leave you with this thought: You go to the polls November the 3d and do what you think is best for your country."", 'I think the people from Maine to California are going to do the same thing. I predict that there will be more votes polled in this election, I predict there will be more votes cast in this election, than any national election we have ever had.', 'And I also predict that we are going to need every single one of you, because we want all the world to know, we want all America to know, that we want to do what is best for our country.

My longtime friend, George Smathers, has been so kind to me on this trip that I am glad that Florida has the good judgment to send him to the United States Senate and to keep him there. Spessard Holland, your senior Senator, has been my friend ever since I went to Congress, and there is no more dedicated, no more honest, or no more effective public servant in Washington than Spessard Holland.', 'I am so pleased and proud to receive the full endorsement of the great Florida State cabinet--Tom Adams, Ed Larson, Ray Green, Jim Kynes, Tom Bailey, and Doyle Conner. And I am mighty pleased to have welcome me outstanding citizens of Florida like Warren Goodrich, Tom Fleming, and Mrs. Annette Baker.', 'I am glad to be here in Orlando. I can now understand why Martin Andersen says it is a privilege to live in central Florida. And it is also a privilege to visit with you as your President, and with your help November 3d I will visit with you again someday.', 'When I come back, I will still be with Senator Spessard Holland, because I know you are going to keep him up there, that fine Florida habit of sending back Senator Holland to Washington where he does so much for the people of all of this State.', 'I understand that another colleague of mine, Syd Herlong, will also be back. We need and we hope that you will send Tom Kenney to represent you in Washington. You need him in Washington and the free world needs him in Washington.', ""You have far too much at stake not to send the strongest possible team to your Nation's Capital."", 'In the last 4 years, per capita income in Florida has gone up twice as fast as the previous 4 years, and unemployment has been cut almost in half. Our new tax cut will increase family income in Florida by an average of $374 and add $79 million to local revenues, and create 52,000 new jobs for this progressive State. But this abundance is not an end in itself.', 'The real test of America is the larger purpose to which we turn our prosperity. We must, in the words of the Bible, ""Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.""', 'In that pursuit, we will give special attention to the problems of the older Americans in our country. Today there are 18 million Americans over the age of 64. By 1980 there will be 25 million. We must make sure that these older Americans can spend their later years in security and dignity, and not deprivation and fear.', 'That is one of the major choices in this election. The issue was clearly drawn in this State. Programs to protect older people against the crushing cost of illness were attacked. The entire social security system supported by every President of both parties has been threatened. To strike at the hopes of older Americans is not courage, and when you make social security voluntary, you do strike at the social security system. It is callousness; it is not conservative. It is a radical departure from the whole course of American policy.', 'A voluntary plan would destroy social security as we know it. The payment of benefits to older Americans depends on receiving premiums from working Americans. So a voluntary program would drastically cut these premiums. The entire system would soon be on the edge of bankruptcy. The protection you have counted on over the years would be menaced.', 'I intend as your President to follow a different course.', 'I offer a new charter of opportunity for older Americans. We will make constructive use of the wisdom and the energies of older Americans as volunteers in the Peace Corps and our war on poverty.', 'We will end discrimination against older Americans in Federal employment.', 'We will increase benefits under social security to the 20 million now receiving benefits, and to the 2 million receiving oldage assistance.', 'We will expand our housing programs for the 50 percent of our people 65 and over that are living in substandard homes or housing unsuited to their needs.', 'We will provide medical care through social security to help 17 million Americans meet the crushing cost of hospitalization.', 'With this charter of opportunity, we can move toward the day when advancing years will bring a renewal of hope and personal happiness.', 'These programs are not charity and they are not handouts, and they are not undeserved blessings.', 'They are insurance programs, paid for over years of labor. They are a recognition of the fact that a prosperous Nation has an obligation to those who have fought its wars, to those who have built its industry, to those who have developed its country, and to those who have fed its people.', 'And they will help all America by giving older citizens a chance to keep contributing to the life of the Nation.', 'This is your choice, a choice between steady progress, building on the gains and the programs of the past, or tearing down all that we have done, leaving our citizens to face a retirement of fear and hopelessness and poverty.', 'I have no doubt which course the Florida people will take. One week from tomorrow you, the masters--not the servants--will go to the polls and select the leadership for this country and for the free world for the next 4 years.', 'I think you want responsible leadership. I think you want experienced leadership. I think you want prudent leadership.', 'I think you want a bipartisan foreign policy, where the Democrats and the Republicans can work together, as Senator Arthur Vandenberg worked with Harry Truman, as Lyndon Johnson worked with Dwight Eisenhower, as Bourke Hickenlooper and Senator Dirksen worked with John Fitzgerald Kennedy.', 'I think that you want a Nation of peace, and I think you must understand that in order to have peace, we must be prepared. We cannot be second in space and first in the world, and this is the first space State in the entire Nation.

Today the average weekly wage is $104.', 'Today our farmers have an income that far exceeds what it was when President Kennedy took office.', 'So I say to you the businessman who last year received $12 billion more after taxes than the year before, the workers who received $60 billion more after taxes than they did the year before, I say it is your duty, it is your obligation, you do it for yourself, when you go to the polls November 3d and vote for peace, vote for space, vote for prosperity, vote for Florida to continue to be one of the fastest growing States in all the Nation, in all the world.', 'When you select the man as your President to lead you, you want to select the person who loves peace and has the knowledge, has the experience, and has the desire to try to achieve it.', 'When you select your next President, the man who must sit there with his thumb close to that button, the man who must reach over and answer that telephone, that ""hot line,"" when Moscow is calling, you want to select the person that, in your conscience, you know has the experience, has the judgment, and that you know will do what is best for his country.', 'We are fortunate in this country to have two great parties. You have a nominee from each party to choose from.

His father, who taught at the old Columbia Theological Seminary, may have nourished that dream when he talked at the supper table with his high-school-age son who was later to become the great President of the United States. Woodrow Wilson came close, mighty close, to making that dream come true, but he could not finish his work.

We don\'t knock the hats off of their ladies, and we do permit them to move down the street from one hotel to the other without danger. I would like to come and say to the people of America that these tactics that we have read about and that we have seen don\'t represent a majority of Americans. They represent a minority of poor, unfortunate souls that ought to be pitied instead of criticized.""', 'So I think here tonight in Georgia, I think in my own heart, and I think in your heart, that all of you know how the South is going to vote. In my heart and in your heart, I think you know that this is how the Americans of all regions, of all religions, of all races, will vote on November 3d.', ""I want to especially thank you good people who came to listen and to learn and to try to find out about the issues. I want to tell you that 11 months ago when I took over the Presidency, I didn't have any time to go to the library or to bring in a council of advisers. In that tragic moment after Dallas, I suddenly had this awesome responsibility thrust upon me. I said with the good Lord's help and with your prayers, I would try to do my dead level best. And I have done that."", 'Now, under our constitutional system, next Tuesday week you will be called upon to turn me out or to select me for 4 more years, and I think I know that in your heart you know what is right.', 'There is only one real issue in this campaign, and it is a very important issue, and it is probably the most important issue that you will ever decide in your lifetime. That issue is peace or war. That issue is whether you have nuclear holocaust or whether you have peace.', 'If you move a thumb up to a button that launches a nuclear holocaust, in a matter of moments you can snuff out the existence of 300 million men and women and children. One hundred million alone, more than half the people in America, would be wiped out in a matter of moments.

We must have a leader who has faith in our country instead of a leader who has doubt in our country. We must have a leader who really is running for the Presidency instead of a leader who is running against the Presideocy all the time.', 'We have got to have someone who believes in the capacity of this country, the future of this country, and the potential of this country, instead of having someone who is frightened, fearful, doubtful, and constantly concerned about us going to hell in a hat.', 'Well, I am not going to tell you how to classify these individuals. You can do that in your own home, in your own way, and then you can go and express yourself. The only one thing I want to tell you is this: There is danger abroad in the world.

Your patriotism was never needed more.', 'There are parents in this crowd that took their son down to the depot to say goodby to him in World War I and World War II, and I pray they will never have to do that again. But I do hope that you take that son and go down to the polling place. I am not saying that you go there and vote for this party or vote for this man. I am saying you go there and do your duty and do your obligation, and live up to your responsibilities of citizenship just like you do when this Nation is confronted with danger in wartime. You go there and do what you think is best.', ""President Eisenhower was a Republican President. I voted for him in 1960 in his foreign policy and his relations with other nations 95 percent of the time. My opponent, who belongs to, or is supposed to belong to, the same party voted for him 25 percent of the time. I want to continue a bipartisan foreign policy, where the leaders of both parties will let politics stop at the water's edge."", 'I said when I was elected leader of the Democrats in the Senate, after Dick Russell nominated me and I was elected unanimously, when President Eisenhower was taking over the Presidency and had a majority of the Senate--the Democrats had been defeated and had been routed--I said, ""Here is going to be my policy: When the Republican President, Mr. Eisenhower, is right, I am going to stand up and proudly support him, and ask my Democrats to follow me. When he is wrong, I am going to oppose him, in decency and dignity, on the basis of the issue and without regard to personality or his children or his dogs,"" because I believe it is every American\'s duty if he wants to be a good citizen, when he casts his vote either in Augusta or in the United States Senate, to vote for what he thinks is best for his country, regardless of his party.', 'So when they asked me what my political philosophy was, I said, ""I am a free man first, I am an American second, I am a public servant third, and I am a Democrat fourth, in that order.""', ""So if in your judgment and your wisdom you decide that after the 11 months that I have tried to do the best I could and pick up where our beloved President John Fitzgerald Kennedy left off and carry on--if you don't join the few voices that would turn me out, and you ask me to stay there for another 4 years, I pledge you that I will give you all that is within me to try to unite the world instead of divide the world, to try to have peace instead of have war, to try to have prosperity instead of have depression, to try to help lead and build a new South, but most of all, a new America that knows no North, no South, no East, no West.""]",1

It came about because of the tax cut, a $12 billion tax cut, and other economic policies of this administration; because this administration cooperated with State and local governments; because this administration helped responsible business and responsible labor work together; because this administration helped responsible private citizens do their part; and because the responsible leaders of both political parties in the Congress voted together, not for their parties but for their country."", ""And that's the way it ought to be."", 'Two of the most responsible men in the United States Senate today are your own Senators, Vance Hartke and Birch Bayh.

It wasn\'t entirely unexpected. My friend and associate Dave Powers told me on the way up here about one of the five O\'Sullivan brothers.

Your industry from shoes to electronics enriches America. In fact, I have more men from Massachusetts in the White House than from all the other States put together, and I will be just as proud to say that in Texas as I am proud to say it in Boston. Larry O'Brien, Kenny O'Donnell, Dick Goodwin, and other loyal allies of John Fitzgerald Kennedy have helped to make this administration what it is tonight."", 'But this modern city of today is also a memorable city of the past. Your streets are rich in American memories. Here have come the scholars and the soldiers and the statesmen and the diplomats to guide the destiny of the great Republic.', 'But no memory is more fresh and none is so bright, and none so mingles pain and gratitude as the memory of John Fitzgerald Kennedy of Massachusetts. He led an entire Nation and he found his way to the secret hopes of man. But he was Irish, he was Massachusetts born, and he was Boston bred.', 'He belongs to the world. But a part of him belongs especially to you, and you are richer for it. When he died the sound of mourning was heard in every street of the earth. But tears came more plentifully to Boston eyes, and grief more painfully to Boston hearts.', ""His qualities were many, but two especially explain his hold on men. He made them believe that they were better than they had thought they were; that perhaps, on earth, God's work could truly be their own."", 'And he could absorb in his imagination the dreams and the longings, the fears and the ambitions of others, whether they lived in mud huts in Africa or whether they lived in the palaces of kings. Somehow they understood that this was so.', 'But when he said ""the torch has been passed,"" he was not speaking of himself, or of any individual, or of any group.

That idea is not ready to be carved on marble monuments. That idea will not be put away on the dusty shelves of memorial libraries. That idea is living tonight. It is breathing, it is growing every hour. And we will carry it forward until it swells to burst the bonds which limit men to less than they can be."", 'Before his inauguration, he spoke to the Massachusetts Legislature. He said the future would ask four questions of his administration and our Nation. These same questions will also be our standard.', 'First, he said, were we truly men of courage? Today we know the answer is yes. We saw an example of that courage in Cuba when determination brought a Communist withdrawal, a memorable victory for the cause of freedom, and a turning point in the cold war.', 'We will continue on the path of courage and bravery in time of crisis, firmness in the face of threats, and the undramatic but the ultimate courage to pursue our goals despite frustration and setback, and regardless of the length of the journey.', 'Second, he said, were we truly men of judgment? The answer to this question is also yes. We saw that judgment after Cuba. We did not press our victory or try to humiliate the Soviet Union. Instead, he seized the chance to move toward meaningful and lasting settlements which might lessen the danger of war. One of the results was the test ban treaty.', 'We will continue to apply judgment, not impulse; to apply restraint, not recklessness; apply wisdom, not uncontrolled emotion. Yes, we will apply these to the great problems of the world. We will ask respect for our interests. We will offer understanding for the honest fears of others. In this way, we can carry on the work of building a lasting peace.', 'Third, he asked, were we truly men of principle? The answer, again, is yes. Nowhere did this integrity shine more brightly than in his fight to secure equal rights to all Americans. Neither the political cost, and it was high, nor the pain of controversy, and it was great, caused a single deviation from the pursuit of full equality for men, special privilege for none.', 'Democratic politics requires accommodation and adjustment to the views of others. But where great principles are at stake, compromise must not obscure the demands of justice. The fulfillment of the promise of our Constitution, and an end to American poverty, are among such principles.', 'Just as Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery 100 years ago, it is the dedicated purpose and objective of the Democratic Party in our time to abolish poverty in the United States of America. And when John Fitzgerald Kennedy was taken from us, he had this program on the drawing board. And thanks to the leadership of the Massachusetts delegation and that towering giant, the Speaker, that program was passed in less than 12 months from the time John Kennedy planned it.', 'Fourth, he asked, were we truly men of dedication? The answer, again, is yes. In every area, dedication to the public good came first. That dedication remains our own:', '--that the life of each citizen shall improve as the Nation improves and grows', '--that the hungry shall be fed, that the old shall be protected, that the ignorant shall find learning', '--that business and labor and farmer and consumer will move forward to the benefit of each and at the expense of none', '--that America will be strong enough to resist any enemy and generous enough to help any friend', '--that neither personal pride nor political gains will stand in the way of the pursuit of peace.', 'John Kennedy said the high court of history would measure our success by these answers. For him, judgment is now in. He has been placed among those who, in the words of the Bible, ""were honored in their generations and were the glory of their times.""', 'But for the rest of us--for you and for me--judgment still waits.', 'In that speech President Kennedy told us that John Winthrop, setting out for America, said to his shipmates, ""We must always consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill--the eyes of all people are upon us.""', 'Well, America tonight is a city upon a hill, and those who watch us look not to our tall buildings or our prosperous streets, or to our mighty arms.

And that evening I said to the people of this great land that with God's help and your prayers, I will do my best. I came back to the White House and got behind that lonely, black, iron fence, and the Secret Service turned the gate lock on me, and there I have been most of the time for 11 months and 3 days."", 'I looked over the inventory of his plans that he had left, and they constituted one of the greatest and most advanced social programs in the history of man. Fifty-one measures, spelled out in detail, that had meant the burning of a lot of midnight oil, had gone to the Congress.', 'A few days ago I sat in that same office after the hour of midnight looking over many measures that had to be signed to become law. The Congress had come and the Congress had gone, and of those 51 major measures on the program of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, every single one of them had passed the Senate of the United States, and all but three or four had passed the House and were in conference. And they are going to be passed, God willing, come next year.', ""I have carried on as best I could. I have done what I told you I would. I have done the best I can. I came back here tonight to Boston because this is where I started 4 years ago, and the hand of fellowship and the hand of friendship and the hand of comradeship of my fallen leader--his friends came out and welcomed me to their homes and to their flats. I came back tonight not because I have the slightest doubt about Boston or Massachusetts, because I don't, but I came back because I never wanted them to have the slightest doubt about me."", 'I am sorry I was so late the other evening, but I seem to always run an hour late and a dollar short. But one of the most remarkable men that has ever been born in this country in my judgment is out in your hospital, God spared his life--Teddy Kennedy. He knew what was best. In due time--I am not a prophet but in due time he will lead a lot more people than those of Massachusetts.', ""He sits in the Senate as a symbol of all that is good and all that represents duty, and all that represents understanding and patience.

And then we will go to bed sometime in the evening in Albuquerque, N. Mex.', 'But we do want to carry on the spirit, the ideals and the program that was begun by that son of Boston, John Fitzgerald Kennedy. He went from one State in this Union to almost every State in the Union, and to many I went with him, and he said, ""Give me your help, give me your heart, give me your hand and we will get America moving again."" And America tonight is moving again.', 'I saw him come back from Vienna after his meeting with Khrushchev. He called the leadership in. In somber tones he told us the danger that our Nation faced. And then he began to build the mightiest military machine that man has ever known. We have more might tonight than any nation in the world, and more might than all of them put together because of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. He added $40 billion in 4 years to the military expenditures and to space expenditures, because he had a vision. His eyes were in the stars and his feet were on the ground, and he knew we could never be first on the earth and second in space.', ""And then came the Cuban missile crisis that men sometimes talk about now when he is not here to defend himself. I can't tell you, I just can't tell you, how sad it makes me feel to think that any worthy public servant would reflect on his conduct or his motives in that period. I don't want to even discuss it because I just think they must not know what they do. But I sat at that table in 37 meetings of the 38 that were held of the executive committee, and at the end he sent us a little silver calendar with each date of that month circled from the day we learned they were there until the day we learned they were gone."", 'I saw the generals with all their stars, and the admirals with all their braid, and the Secretary of State with a long record of great diplomatic performance behind him, distinguished service; and the Secretary of Defense, the former manager of the Ford Motor Co., at a salary of more than half a million a year that he gave up to serve his country. But the coolest man in that room always was the man that sat at the head of the table, John Fitzgerald Kennedy.', ""I never left my wife and daughters in the morning knowing whether I would see them that night, because those missiles were about to become operational. But I saw those two men, the spokesman for the Soviet Union and the spokesman for the free world, and there they stood while we went through 38 meetings, eyeball to eyeball, with their knife right on each other's ribs and never quivering or never moving until Mr. Khrushchev picked up his missiles and put them on his ships and took them back home."", 'We have much to remember, much to be thankful for, and all of our lives will be better because he passed our way.', 'Thank you.']",1

Johnson ,"October 27, 1964","['Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls:', 'This is a great Democratic Tuesday in Pittsburgh, and a week from tonight it is going to be a great Democratic Tuesday.', 'When I was a little boy, living in a small house, in a small town, in the backwoods of my State, I remember hearing a political leader say at the Fourth of July picnic that he loved freedom so much that he just wished all the people had a little bit of it. And as I came into this magnificent building tonight, and I saw the new Pittsburgh, and I saw all of these happy, smiling faces, I just wished that everybody in our country could be here, because I think it would be contagious.', 'What a wonderful land it would be if all of our people were as happy tonight as you are. I even wish that some members--some temporary members--of another party could be here tonight so a little bit of this happiness would rub off on them.', 'It would be such a nice thing if these prophets of doom and gloom, and these apostles of fear and doubt, and these voices of smear and hate, and these suspicious persons who deal in petty things could just come here and see the heart of America, see them with faith and with hope, and with vision and with happiness, and with belief in the future of our land.', 'You people of Pittsburgh have a ""can do"" mayor, a man who looks ahead, who doesn\'t spend his time talking about the past, who has kept this city growing, who has kept it prospering. He is a great mayor and he is my friend and your friend--Joe Barr.', 'Before I get into my main speech, and it is not going to take over an hour or so, I want to ask you to do a few things for me if you can and if you can find the time, and I will get along with them just as soon as I can, because I have to meet Lady Bird in Evansville, Ind., for another speech. And then she and I are going to have a little anniversary, kind of a little 30-year honeymoon over in Albuquerque tonight.', ""You know, that poor girl has been traveling since daylight this morning and she has been through Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and she is winding up in Evansville tonight, and I'll bet I have seen more people in this hall than she has seen all day. But I wouldn't be a bit surprised that she convinced a lot more of them than I have."", 'Here is what I want you to do for me. Here in the 14th Congressional District, you will be sending back to Congress to help me and to help the Nation, and to help Pennsylvania, a straight-thinking, a straight-talking friend of yours and of mine for many years. I want you to get out there tomorrow and start to work for him. Be sure that you give him a majority that he can brag about. That is Bill Moorhead.', 'From the 20th District you have a fellow who has fought awfully hard for me, and he has fought long and he has fought effectively. He is down at the White House getting a pen for some law that he has passed nearly every few weeks. He is the Congressman from the 20th District. He has been very helpful, and I hope you will give Elmer J. Holland a good majority.', 'Then there is Westmoreland County, that ""Get it done, and get it done now"" Congressman, John Dent.', ""I don't know of a single man in America, and I don't make any exceptions, who is more valuable to this Republic, or who has done more for it in his own quiet way, always amenable, always reasonable, always enlightened. But he has done more to improve our relations with other nations and to bring peace in the world, and to keep your boys out of another war, than most any other man in either House."", 'He is a quiet, unassuming man. He never goes around slapping backs, talking big, smoking cigars, and telling you how he did it, but he is the kind of man that every district needs in Congress, and that every mother wants there to represent her in dealing with other nations. His name is Doc Morgan, and he is Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee.', 'He takes bills and he holds them in his committee and he has hearings for weeks on them. He has the best witnesses and the experts from all over the Nation. Then he reports them out with almost a solid vote from his party. He brings them to the House of Representatives. He passes them as they should have been passed, and he never even tells you about it. You have to call him up and it takes you a day or two sometimes for him to even answer the phone, and he says, ""Thank you very much.""', 'I want you to know, Doc, that we want you to have a great majority when you come back there.', ""Pennsylvania needs John Young and Frank Reed in the Congress. In fact, from the courthouse to the White House, we are going to need some more Democrats to help us keep this country moving. And you want to keep moving, don't you?"", 'Next Tuesday will show that in this Keystone State of democracy, you agree with me that the Government of this country needs more women in general and it needs in particular your lovely and remarkable Genevieve Blatt.', ""I heard that someone intimated the other day that I had been strong for bringing women in Government, but they wanted to kind of imply that the President might perhaps not be too unhappy if another man was elected to the Senate, and came back there and Genevieve was defeated. Well, now, that is just one man's viewpoint. If he is quoted correctly, it is only his viewpoint."", 'Someone said to me the other day that Genevieve was one of the most competent women in this country. I am somewhat reluctant to tell you f disagreed. I think Genevieve is one of the most competent people in this country, man or woman, and if you want Pennsylvania to rebuild, if you want Pennsylvania to move again, if you want the voices of Pennsylvania to dominate the greatest deliberative body in the world, with their eloquence, with their respect, and with their influence, you give us two Democratic Senators from that State to work together like a team and we will give Pennsylvania some real results.', ""I don't think your State can do any greater service than to send this able and dedicated woman to the Senate. Pennsylvania needs her there. The Nation needs her there, and the President wants and needs her there, and hopes you will help him."", ""She could serve alongside of that fighting patriot who never turns away from what he believes to be right and just for all the people. He doesn't even turn away from giving me a lick now and then when he thinks I am wrong. But he is an independent, able, and courageous fighter for the people all the time, and for the right as he sees it all the time, Senator Joe Clark."", 'Now, those are a lot of recommendations to make, but when you have taken good Democratic care of your interests, and you have taken care of these people in the House, and you have taken care of these people in the Senate, I have another little cowcatcher suggestion that I want to make to you, and that is, I hope you will take care of Hubert Humphrey and Lyndon Johnson. These are all Democratic requests, but we are all Americans first and we are members of a political party second. This is especially important this year.', ""I know your Governor well. I have always had respect for his judgment, and I thought that he really made some good bipartisan points last July out at San Francisco. Bill Scranton seemed to me to be saying what deep in his heart he knew was right. So let's make next Tuesday not just a great day for Democrats, but let's make it a great day for Americans, because the last poll that we concluded in Pennsylvania last week showed that nearly 40 percent of the Republicans of this State are going to vote Democratic."", ""If a neighbor comes into your house, even if he is not your kinfolk, you bring out the welcome mat and you are cordial and you make him feel at home. If 40 percent of the Republicans are willing to come in and help us with good government, let's welcome them in under the tent."", 'There is another thing I want to thank you good folks for, and that is a man that you knew as mayor and that you knew as Governor. He is a man that I have known as a long personal friend since I was a young boy. He is a counselor and servant of Presidents, of the people, and of the Democratic Party, a man the Democrats know as one of the all-time great political leaders that either party has produced in this Nation.', 'I had an old friend of mine come up and he was talking about the young people that were taking the leadership. There was a young Governor, I believe from Oregon, who had some part on the program out in San Francisco. He said, ""Who selected Dave Lawrence to be chairman of this extremely important committee?""', 'I said, with a great deal of pride,', '""I did."" He said, ""I thought the Governor had retired and had gotten out of politics. With all of these young people that are full of ambition and vinegar and everything, and just like to keep moving ahead, why did you pick Dave Lawrence?""', 'I said, ""Well, let\'s talk about that a little later.""', 'We went ahead and we kept on the television. In a few minutes, Dave Lawrence came in with a steady nerve and with a solid step and with good countenance and with a strong voice, and he read a report. He said, ""Mr. Chairman, I move the adoption of that report.""', 'The chairman hit his gavel and said, ""Without objection, the report is adopted unanimously.""', 'I turned around to my friend and said, ""That is why I selected Dave Lawrence.""', 'I am happy tonight. I feel very cheered to see my old and my loyal friend Dave McDonald here. Dave is always there when you need him, and his heart is always on the side of the people. And I believe he has more Steelworkers here tonight than he had at the convention in Atlantic City.', ""I just couldn't be more pleased at the unity that you people have shown to your President. There are so many more areas of agreement, there are so many more things that unify us than divide us. Any one of you can find something to disagree and fight about. Every man and his wife have differences. None of us see everything alike; if we did see everything alike we would all want the same wife. But when your President comes here, I like to see people stand united."", ""I just couldn't be happier tonight, and I have to say so publicly, than to see and visit with my longtime friend, a counselor of mine, one who has acted as my legal counselor in the Senate and times when I called him from Pennsylvania to come down and help me on certain legislation. That is Justice Mike Musmanno. His kind of loyalty and his kind of steadfastness is what I think is going to make the Democratic Party an enduring and effective instrument for progress and prosperity."", 'If Bill Scranton, after all the letters he wrote, and all the statements that he made, and all the things that he thought, can go out here in Pennsylvania and introduce Goldwater, I am happy that Mike Musmanno can come up here and sit on a platform with Genevieve Blatt and Lyndon Johnson.', 'Mrs. Emma Guffey Miller, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your being here tonight. You have been one of my favorite girls for a good many years. I am not going to say how many. But I appreciate your coming over here and I am proud to be with you and my other fellow Democrats.', 'There are two great plans for progress in America today, and Pittsburgh is a blueprint for both of them. Lincoln abolished slavery 100 years ago, and we are going to abolish poverty under Democratic Party leadership in this country. There is no real reason for Americans to be prisoners of the nagging fear of unemployment or of destitution or of despair.', ""We have a gross national product of over $600 billion, and we don't make money just to make money. We make money for the betterment of man and for the fuller and richer life for human beings, And we are going to do that when we build the Great Society. This is what you in this city have meant by the Pittsburgh renaissance."", 'Not many years ago Pittsburgh was a worn-out, old city, known more for its waste than for its wealth, known more for its slums than its skyscrapers, known more for its polluted rivers than its precious resources. Its skies were blackened with smoke. When you saw the blue, it just meant the mills were down and the people were hungry. Then you got to work. You started doing something about it.', 'Today Pittsburgh is a city of clear skies, it is a city of clean buildings, it is a city of uncluttered streets. It has lovely parks and beautiful homes. I always like to come and stay at this hotel and get up and look out my window and see what used to be and what is. And your world famous, and now world conquering, Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra-those are things you people ought to take a lot of pride in.', 'To these people who talk about raw, naked power, and these people that talk about Government centralization, these people that talk in these glittering generalities, covering everything and touching nothing, to those who want to repeal the progress of our times, I say, then, let them come here and take a look at Pittsburgh.', 'Four years ago a beloved American, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, came here and he looked at you as I am looking at you tonight, and he talked about a ""new partnership."" He believed and I believed--and you have shown--that progress has to be a partnership affair. To those who want to repeal the whole idea of people working together through Government where necessary, I say to them, then, come here and look at Pittsburgh!', 'I believe deeply that Government must not be bigger by a single bureau or a single employee or a single dollar than it has to be. And I would have you know that I reduced the deficit from nearly $9 billion to $5 billion this year. I would have you know that during July and August we spent $676 million less than we spent last July and August. I would have you know that we had 25,000 less Federal employees on the Federal payroll this July 1964, than we had July 1963.', ""But honest government is government that doesn't waste a cent of money, or a minute of time, and the people's business has to be carried on, and a lot of what we want to do has to be done together--the city, the county, the State, the Federal Government--and this is a key issue in this election."", 'The opposition candidate has voted to cut out or cut down every program of common responsibility for anything, from national defense to education, social security. When he says make social security voluntary, our answer is that old age and the sickness that comes with it is not voluntary, and we believe in more insurance in old age and not less. While he is talking about Bobby Baker, Walter Jenkins, and Billie Sol Estes, we want to talk about urban renewal, we are going to talk about low-income housing, we are going to talk about area redevelopment, we are going to talk about his vote against aid to education.', 'All of these things he opposed. All of these things he voted no, no, no on. We have unfortunate things happen to us and we have disappointments; and 3 million men working for the Government, they make mistakes. The only thing we can do with them, when we find out about the mistakes, is to take their job away from them, ask for their resignation, and turn it over to a nonpartisan agency to investigate to see if they have violated any laws. That is what we have done. Some in the other party get promoted.', 'There are a lot of things that have helped rebuild Pittsburgh, and on all of these things that have, he voted against them.', 'I think these things that I just listed will help build the Great Society and I think you are for them.', 'Our opponent voted against the Manpower Development and Retraining Act that Congressman Holland and Joe Clark had so much to do with. They got it passed. He opposed it. If he had had his way, it would be dead. This act has already helped 5,400 Pennsylvania workers win their fight against machines, and get retrained, and we are for that and he is against it.', 'And when we say as a Nation ""In God We Trust,"" this doesn\'t mean everybody for himself and the devil takes the hindmost. Government is not the end of people. Government, prudent government, responsible government, is the people, and that is what this election is all about, the responsibility of people, acting together, to keep prosperity here at home, to keep peace here at home, to keep peace between business and labor and Government, and to keep peace in the world.', ""The opposition candidate voted against this year's tax cut. We Democrats believe in making the economy stronger. He voted against the nuclear bomb test agreement. We believe in making the world safer, and our milk cleaner. Our opposition protests that the issues are not being drawn in this campaign. Well, me thinketh he protesteth too much."", 'What are the issues in this election? Well, I will tell you what they are. The issues in this election are our votes, the Democratic votes, for and his votes against the Civil Rights Act, his votes against the Trade Expansion Act, his votes against the Mass Transit Act, his votes against the Wilderness Act, his votes even against the war on poverty. These are all issues in this campaign, and we are wrapping them right around his neck.', ""These are not issues that necessarily divide Democrats and Republicans, because the opposition candidate in this campaign voted 25 times in the past 4 years against major proposals which were in the 1960 Republican platform and were supported by a majority of Republican Senators. That is almost unbelievable, isn't it, that the Republican nominee voted 25 times on 25 separate roll calls against provisions in the Republican platform that were supported by a majority of Republican Senators !"", ""I looked up the record the other day when he was talking about sending General Eisenhower to Viet-Nam. I don't think he took the time to talk to General Eisenhower about it. But it did make a headline momentarily."", ""I just wondered. He said he was going to follow everything on foreign policy. I remembered he said that the Eisenhower administration was just another dime-store New Deal. So I went back and looked at the record. I found out that in the year 1960, the last year President Eisenhower was there, I voted for President Eisenhower's foreign policy 95 percent of the time, and the Republican nominee voted for it 25 percent of the time."", ""When President Eisenhower became President, he really wrecked a lot of Democrats, and he broke a lot of dishes on the table, and a lot of them went home and were defeated. There weren't many people there to take the leadership. They elected me as the Democratic leader."", 'The first thing I said to my caucus was, ""I want you to know when I think the President is right I am going to raise his hand high and I am going to support him. When I think he is wrong, I am going to oppose him, but I am going to do it with decency and dignity and without regard to personalities and I will never talk about his boy or his dogs or things of that kind.""', ""I remember that it was a great Republican Senator, Arthur Vandenberg, that stood shoulder to shoulder with Harry Truman and stopped the Communists in Greece and Turkey. I remember that Lyndon Johnson stood right by the side of Eisenhower in the Suez and in the Strait of Formosa. I remember in his tax bill that I stood there in 1954 and supported it when a substantial number of my own party wouldn't go along with me."", ""So I don't think there is going to be a Republican peace or a Democratic peace, but I think there is going to be a peace only for all Americans and for all the world. When they lead your boy down to that railroad station to send him into boot camp and put a khaki uniform on him to send him some place where he may never return, they don't ask you whether you are a Republican or Democrat. They send you there to defend that flag, and you go."", ""So there is no Republican peace or no Democratic peace, and there can't be prosperity for Democrats or prosperity for Republicans. But there can and will be, as long as I am President, peace for all Americans and prosperity for all Americans."", 'Some people say that we passed an act up there that is going to take a lot of jobs away from folks. I want to meet that one head-on. That is pure dirty racism and propaganda that is being passed around.', 'There is not any bill that Congress ever passed that takes any job away from anybody. It gives a lot of people jobs, it provides extra jobs, it provides retraining for jobs that our Republican opponent voted against every time he had a chance. But they put out a lot of words to try to smear and fear and scare people who are working, by saying that some other man is going to get his job. Well, I want to answer that with a little story Lady Bird told me.', 'A man came up to her in Alabama on her train trip, where she had gone to school in the summer, where she went to the University of Alabama when she was a young girl. He said, ""Lady Bird, I have been thinking about this problem a lot and they have put out a lot of stories down here about what has happened. But I believe that I would rather have a Negro stand beside me on an assembly line than to stand behind me in a soup line!""', 'Men who have jobs and who have seniority are going to be employed on the basis of their merit. And every State except 19 States, most of them in the South, already have laws stronger than we have passed.', ""We all know that it was 100 years ago that a great President, a man that we all revere--there is not a man, woman, or child in this house that would get up tonight and even whisper a word about him, although he said when he returned to his hometown in Illinois he went down the street and not one human would speak to him except one woman, and she wouldn't have if she could have gotten out of it. That is what Abraham Lincoln said. That is what they said about him during his turbulent career."", 'But we know that he signed the Emancipation Proclamation 100 years ago. We have had some deliberate speed for 100 years. Emancipation was a proclamation but it was not a fact.', 'We are not going to say that the good Lord intended that the tall men should be treated different than the short men, or that the white men should be treated differently from the black men or the brown men, because if we do, we are outnumbered in this country 15 or 20 to 1 throughout the world. We live in a world of 3 billion people, and you better not ever choose to fight it out on the basis of color. If you do, the white folks are in trouble, I will tell you that.', 'So we are not going to make any special appeals to any special groups. I think I demonstrated in 1960, after John Fitzgerald Kennedy had defeated me overwhelmingly and humiliatingly. He came to my room the next morning and asked me to go on the ticket with him as Vice President.', 'I had never thought that I would ever do anything like that. I thought for 7 or 8 hours and it finally boiled down to two things.', 'I just knew in my heart that it was not right for Dick Nixon to ever be President of this country.', 'And I also knew that one morning at an Air Force site in Europe the boys had completed their 50 missions and were ready to come home to see their wives, sweethearts, and mothers when a commanding officer walked in and said, ""We have a most dangerous mission that must be performed today, and we want volunteers. All of you have already finished your missions, but we need some volunteers.""', 'The first two men that stood up were Joe Kennedy, Jr., from Boston, a Catholic, and a young blond from Texas, from Fort Worth, Tex., with a wife and two babies, who walked up and stood by his side. He was a Baptist. And they took off in that plane and they never came back. But there is no one who dared ask them that morning what church they went to.', 'I thought I would just like to take a little slice of the proposition of proving to all the world that we elected our Presidents and Vice Presidents, and we treated our citizens of all races and religions and color alike, and that we could elect a President of this country who was a Catholic, and we could elect a Vice President of this country who was a southerner. And that is what we did.', 'Eleven months and three days ago, that tragic day of November 22d, our leader fell. And without benefit of council and without time to go to the library stacks, without a moment to call in anyone to consult, with the Secret Service men on top of me stretched out in a little Ford police car, I got in a jet plane with the motors roaring in the background and took the oath of office as President.', 'I swore to uphold the Constitution, and I swore to myself that I would carry on, I would continue for my partner who had gone down ahead of me.', ""The transition period was a difficult period. The heads of 85 nations came here. We talked over problems and agreements that had never been reached and we made decisions that had to be made, and the budget had to be formulated, $100 billion in 30 days. And we kept that light burning in the White House--notwithstanding what they tell you about my cutting them off--we kept them burning there until 2 or 3 o'clock many mornings."", 'But we looked down the inventory that he had left on his desk. He had 51 major bills, the greatest agenda of bills that I guess any President had ever sent a Congress in modern times: the tax bill, the civil rights bill, the mass transit bill, the housing bill, three education bills, the farm bill, the wilderness bill. I could name them all night, 51 of them.', 'I went back to that room the other night, when the Secret Service turned the key on the black steel gate we entered, and they said, ""Do you want to get off at the house or do you want to go to the office?"" I said, ""I will go back to the office.""', ""About 1 o'clock I took those bills and I started looking down that list that he had left me. The Congress had come and the Congress had gone away. But on that list every single one of those 51 bills had passed the United States Senate, and all but 4 or 5 of them had passed the House. They were in conference--medical care, the coffee agreement, Appalachia. But I put it into effect by an Executive order1 and we are going to put it into effect by legislation as soon as Joe and Genevieve get back up there and start voting as a team."", '1 Executive Order 11186 ""Establishing the Federal Development Planning Committee for Appalachia,"" issued October 23, 1964 (see Item 711).', 'And we have some more things that we have to do for America. I said let us continue. But I also said at the convention I want a mandate, I want a mandate not just to let us continue but I want a mandate to begin.', 'I want a program for all the people of this country, equal opportunity for all and special privilege for none. I want every man and woman that wants a job to have a job. There are 5 million more working now than there were when Jack Kennedy took the oath of office. We have done something about it but not enough.', 'Corporations made $12 billion more after taxes this last year than they did the year before. So business is doing reasonably well. The workingman made $60 billion more after taxes than he did the year before, so he is doing reasonably well.', ""The farmer's income is up $12 billion this year, and if you would follow my opponent's advice and cut out all of these programs it would drop in half, to $6 billion, and we would be back where we were in 1932."", ""And don't you think it can't happen here, because it has happened here. It happened here before some of you were born or some of you are willing to admit that you were born. I think that is why next Tuesday will be not just an all-Democratic day. I think it is going to be an all-American day."", 'So we must get on with our work because there is so much to do. No city or country is ever all that that city or country ought to be. A nation, deeply understood, is an opportunity for service, a dedication to an unfinished dream.', ""The Great Society is when America's promise and her practice come together. The Great Society just isn't a dream of mine. It is as real as tomorrow, and it is yours for the working at it."", 'And here is how we do it: We care about every single man, woman, and boy in this country. Not just about some of them. Not just about most of them.', 'The Great Society under a Democratic President cares for all of them. And then we set our sights high, higher than we expect to get, at least higher than we expect to get right away, for we know that all we need to do in this country is to decide to do it.', ""We're as big as our ideas. We're as strong as our purposes. So here is the Great Society."", ""It's the time--and it's going to be soon-when nobody in this country is poor.

I am proud to tell you that John F. Kennedy was the coolest man in that room.', 'As he and the leader of the Soviet Union came eyeball to eyeball, and their thumbs started inching up--that was the day before the ""hot line"" when you could pick up the phone and Moscow would be calling--their thumbs started getting closer to that nuclear button, their knives were in each other\'s ribs almost, literally speaking, and neither of them was flinching or quivering. About that moment, Mr. Khrushchev in his wisdom decided that he would wrap up his missiles and take them home.', 'Our bombers were in the skies and our bomb bays were ready to be opened. They were loaded. Our ships were in their proper places. Our men had their proper instructions. But when the time finally came, the good Lord somehow or other decreed that there would not be a nuclear holocaust that would wipe out the lives of 300 million people, 100 million right here in our own land.', ""And now, to have someone speak ill and critically of that crisis and of President Kennedy's conduct is too sad to even justify a response, because he is not here to answer it himself."", 'But we are going to answer it for him on November 3d. We are going to say to the world that our policy is strength through restraint. We are going to keep our guard up at all times, alert, but we are going to have our hand out.

That is your judgment. You have to make it with your God and your own conscience.', ""I haven't come here to say anything personal or bad or ill-willed, or sling any mud, or have any muckraking.

I enjoyed riding that elevator tonight more than I have ever enjoyed it before. The last time I was here was 40 years ago. I came in a T-model Ford. The only reception committee that greeted me was the boy that ran the elevator, and I am happy that my friends have increased and we have got a larger reception committee out here tonight.', 'This is a sentimental visit for me, and I am not going to talk long, and I am not going to talk too political. I want to first of all thank you people of San Bernardino for sending to Congress a most competent and able colleague of mine and my friend for many years, Harry Sheppard. Harry is a very young man and was probably playing marbles when I was here but I remember Phil Swing used to represent this district. Do any of you remember that?', 'The last Congress was one of the most productive in history, and I think this was because the responsible leaders of both parties worked together. The next Congress that starts in January is going to be productive, too. We are all going forward together, Republicans and Democrats alike, because all good Americans want to do what is best for their country before they do what is best for their party.', 'We are going to build a bigger and a better America. We are going to build it in the broad and vital center of the American political landscape, and we are not going to build it on the shaky, quaking fringes.', 'California and San Bernardino are a growing State and a growing city--and a growing population needs a growing economy. That is exactly what we have in the United States today. For the first time in all of our history, 72 million Americans have jobs, 5 million more than had jobs when President Kennedy took the oath of office 4 years ago. Personal income has risen by $80 billion after taxes, and corporate profits after taxes have already increased over $12 billion.', 'In the stock market today, the value of stocks on the exchange is worth more than $100 billion more than they were worth when I took office November 22d, 11 months ago. And in this great surge forward, California has led the way. Right here in the San Bernardino-Riverside-Ontario area, the number of jobs increased by 27,000 between 1960 and 1964. And I am here tonight to pledge you that we are going to keep on increasing them, we are going to keep on moving ahead.', ""You and I believe in thinking ahead about our country's future. We believe that social security benefits should be extended. I was just talking to my friend Mrs. Platt, of the Platt Building, down there before I came up here, and I told her that I believe that our eider citizens have a right to decent medical care under social security after long lives of service to this country."", 'We believe that every child has a right to the best education he can use.', ""I am told that this is the largest county in the United States.

When such changes come upon the world, then that is the time for the United States to be prudent, to be stable, to be sound, to be sure, and to act. But before we act we must think. We just can't guess."", 'In the nuclear age, the President does not get a chance to make a second guess. We cannot make a foreign policy, we cannot keep the peace by ultimatum, by rattling our rockets, or by bluffing with our bombs.', 'We can keep the peace, and we can only keep the peace, by two methods: first, by a strong defense; and second, by reason and responsibility and negotiation.', 'Strong defense comes first.

And tonight, California is responsible for 23.1 percent of our defense effort in the United States, more than twice as much as any other State in the Union. Fifty percent of our entire space effort is carried out in the great State of California, and this is up from 40 percent when President Kennedy took office in 1961.', 'This growth has come because America needs what California has to offer. It has come here strictly on merit. And so long as I am your President, it will continue to come here strictly on merit, and so long as I am your President, the Department of Defense stands ready to help any community, any industry, any individual that may suffer temporary dislocation because of changes in technology.', 'You can count on that. And I think that I know that you are patriotic enough that I can count on you to help me keep America strong and mighty.', 'But it is not enough to be powerful. Power alone is not enough. America must also be wise. We must be strong, but we must be sensible. We must be resolute, but we must be responsible. The stakes in the 20th century are too high to be reckless.', ""It is not easy to keep the peace in the world, but for 20 years we have kept the peace.

People are waiting for us in San Diego, and then we have to go to Salt Lake City tonight.

I want to tell you how good your Governor and his lovely wife have been to me. I want to tell you how nice your new Congressman, Ken Dyal, has been, and how wonderful Harry Sheppard has been through the years. I want to tell you that Pierre Salinger is doing a bang-up job in Washington. Now I want to introduce you to the President's boss."", '[At this point Mrs. Johnson spoke briefly. She said that she had been hearing about the President\'s ""adventures in California and in San Bernardino for just about all of the 30 years that we have been married .... When he came out here on that adventure, age 15 and just right out of a little, smalltown high school, nothing like this loomed before him. It was the farthest thing from his thoughts or from any of those who knew him. One of the things that made the difference,"" she said, ""was the fact that he finally went back home and went to college and got a good education.""

Two years ago, on October 28, 1962, the United States of America achieved the greatest success of the nuclear age. After weeks of fright and danger and tension, after America's firmness and coolness and unity were proved, it was on that date that Chairman Khrushchev announced that he would get his missiles out of Cuba."", 'In all the history of man, there has perhaps never been a moment of greater peril than the Cuban confrontation. I attended 38 meetings with the President and his Security Council; the generals and their stars; the admirals and their braid; the Secretary of State, a Rhodes scholar, with his great diplomatic experience; the Secretary of Defense, the former president of Ford Motor Co. at $550,000 a year. And the President went around the table and got the suggestions from all those present, including the Vice President.', ""There were moments when I guess some men were a little more hotheaded than others. There were moments when some were a little more impulsive than others. There were moments of distress and indecision while we were looking at all the facts, because no man's judgment on any question is any better than his information on that question."", 'And yet, when all is said and done, it gave me a great deal of satisfaction that you people out there, just you lay people of the United States, had selected the Commander in Chief by your votes, and the coolest man in that room during all those 38 meetings was John Fitzgerald Kennedy.', ""During that time, that was the moment when human understanding caught up with nuclear knowledge, and reason regained its rule over force. That moment proved a truth that some had doubted, that the power of American arms is the guarantee of the world's peace and that America's might is the necessary instrument of right."", 'You no doubt remember, and I shall never forget, the brave and good and careful President who steered us surely and safely through those weeks of trial. I saw him do it. I never left my wife and daughters a single morning that I was sure I could see them again. But I know how calm and how wise John Kennedy was.', 'We may hope when this campaign is over that one unthinking, unthinkable charge will be removed from this political record: that what happened 2 years ago today, some said, was an election trick--by a martyred President--who is not now here tonight to defend himself.', 'In a sense, that is what this campaign and this election is all about. The one overriding issue is our handling of the fact of our infinite power. The one overriding issue is our sense of responsibility and its use.

We know we need them, and we know we have plenty of them. We know they are dangerous, and we know they can bring death to us all, and we know that just testing them in the atmosphere has poisoned the air that we breathe and the milk that our children drink, and it endangered unborn children. So we must be careful about them.', 'The one who must be most careful for all of you, the most prudent, cautious person in the United States, ought to be your President of the United States.', ""I know that duty, as other Presidents have known it before me. I know that the responsibility for exercising that duty is the President's, and it is his alone, and he is alone a great deal of the time. He is lonely most of the time.

We have increased our foreign trade since President Kennedy took office by 25 percent. It is up now to $24 billion and that means extra jobs for your men. That means extra profits for your industry, and that means extra taxes for Uncle Sam.', 'And then the Peace Corps, these young men and women from good, wonderful, wholesome families, fresh out of college maybe, some of them perhaps almost ready to retire, they wanted to go to all the corners of the world to try to help others help themselves. There has never been another success story like it, and I am so proud of it.', 'We must try to be responsible for the help for other nations, because our per capita income is more than $200 a month per person. Yet half of the world lives off of a per capita income of less than $200 a month.

That is our big problem.', 'A great son of the South that was raised in South Carolina where I spoke the night before last, at Columbia, Woodrow Wilson, had a dream of peace for all the people of the world.

They knew we had lost our President. They wanted to see what kind of a transition we could have.', 'Castro went out and turned off the water at our Guantanamo base. Immediately one of the candidates for President shouted, ""Send in the Marines."" I considered sending in the Marines. I think the Marines would have been willing to go if I just mashed that button and said, ""Gentlemen, that is your duty."" But I never saw a Marine that just went out and invited holocaust and disaster and suicide.', 'So we thought about it a few minutes Before we sent in the Marines. And we finally decided after we talked to the best advisers we could get that it was a lot wiser to send one little admiral down there to cut that water off than to send in all those Marines to turn it on. And then we borrowed one of your desalinization plants here in San Diego, and we took it out there. Now we make our own water and we fired 2,000 Cubans and told them, ""We are not going to give you any money any more and you go back and tell Castro he cost you your job.""', ""The Marines were ready and the Marines were willing.

Another one is on a hill and the helicopter was hovering over him but they started shooting at the helicopter and they couldn\'t pick him up and he was captured. But he finally escaped on his own.""', ""That makes the goose pimples come up on you when you mash that button and tell them to go out and they don't come back at 3:30, because you know they are some mother's son, and except for the grace of God it might be my mother's son.

We located their nests where they had these little PT boats, and we saw a city there that had a lot of women and children in it that was on the Chinese border where there are 700 million people, but we didn't see any reason that we should take that target and kill a lot of innocent people, women and children. What we wanted was where those PT boats were nesting. We wanted to get the old hen's nest."", 'So we looked at the targets and we picked this one and we picked this one and we picked this one and this one, and then your heart kind of comes up in your throat a minute, but you say, ""Go on in, men,"" give them the order, and the answer is to go ahead.

I want to see this city and this county stand up and be counted on the side of responsible government for this Nation and for peace in the world.', 'You already have responsible government in this State under Governor Pat Brown. Another vote for responsibility in government is a vote for Senator Pierre Salinger. Pierre knows this State and he knows the great policy questions that we have to decide in the Nation and the world, and California needs a spokesman like Pierre Salinger in the United States Senate.', 'John Tunney is one of the finest young congressional candidates that I have ever seen in America. He came out to March Field while he was in the Air Force and he got so enthusiastic about Riverside he just decided to stay. But you need him and we need him, his drive, his intelligence, and his enthusiasm, in Congress. We need him to punch hard for programs for Riverside and California.', ""These next 4 years will be decisive for this country, and I think they will be decisive for the world. These 4 years may well decide our destiny and may well decide the world's destiny for the next 40 years."", 'To make the right decisions, we must move ahead on two broad fronts: Here at home we must strengthen our economy and we must bring dignity and opportunity to the lives of all Americans. Abroad we must constantly work for peace. We must work for peace every day and every hour, with every ounce of strength and patience that we can muster.', ""At home we are going to continue the unprecedented prosperity of the last 45 months of the John F. Kennedy-Lyndon Johnson administration. Since John Fitzgerald Kennedy took the oath of office, we have added 5 million new jobs to our economy, and of these 5 million, 500,000 of these jobs came to the State of California. Wages and salaries after taxes are up nearly $60 billion, and the Nation's total production is expanding at the rate of 5 percent a year. This is progress without precedent."", 'But we are not satisfied. We are going to press forward with broad-gauge social security, opening up new jobs, keeping our economy strong, and we are going to fight an all-out war on poverty.', ""While we make ourselves strong at home, we must keep our guard up abroad. We must remain strong. Responsible America is the world's best guarantee of a just and continuing peace. But I want to say to you now that all our strength at home and abroad is of no use if we do not use that strength wisely and we do not use it prudently, and we do not use it with restraint and good judgment."", 'There is no room in America for trigger-happy threats in a world that is made dark by the shadow of nuclear catastrophe.', 'I understand that the last President to visit Riverside was William Howard Taft 55 years ago. President Taft began his inaugural address that I went back and read the other day when I decided to come here, and he started that address by saying, ""Anyone who has taken the oath that I have just taken must feel a heavy weight of responsibility.""', 'That responsibility in the nuclear age is frightening and is awesome indeed. And it is inescapable. It cannot be delegated.', 'For the last 20 years 5 Presidents of both political parties, working with the responsible leaders in Congress of both political parties, have forged a bipartisan foreign policy. And I do not think that America is going to change that responsible, bipartisan foreign policy next Tuesday.', 'It used to be said that the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world. Today the hand that pushes the button is the hand that could destroy the world.', 'The Communists know that America is strong. They know because we turned them back at Berlin and Cuba and in the waters around Viet-Nam.', 'But I pledge you that we shall be responsible always, as well as strong.

You will select that leadership based on information, based on knowledge, based on judgment; not based on fanaticism or emotion.', 'The kind of leadership you want is the kind of leadership that your heart tells you is right for your country and for your family.', 'California is the number one State in the Union. California is the leader of the rest of the States. California has a peculiar obligation to be prudent and be careful and be cautious and be responsible. We have had enough of reckless talk. We have had enough of impulsive action.', ""It is mighty easy to talk like a bravado when you are talking about someone else's sons, but when you get up where your thumb has the responsibility for touching that button, and you get to thinking about the consequences of that act that will kill 300 million people, it is a time for prayer, it is a time for sober reflections, and the hotheads ought. to go back to the bench in the hothouse."", 'I am not going to tell you that one party has all the mortgage on the patriotism of this country. Men in all parties love this country and are patriotic believers in our system of government.', 'The Democrats have no mortgage on patriotism because it was Senator Arthur Vandenberg, a Republican Senator, who joined with President Harry Truman to stop the Communists in Greece and Turkey. It was Senator Lyndon Johnson who joined with President Dwight Eisenhower in the Suez crisis and in the Formosa Strait. It was Senator Everett Dirksen, a Republican from Illinois, that joined with John Fitzgerald Kennedy, our beloved President, when other men were harassing him, when other men were opposing him, when other men were voting against his test ban treaty.', 'So for 20 years we have maintained the peace through strength, but through the cooperation of good Republicans and good Democrats who thought more of their country than they did of their party.', ""I was in Pennsylvania last night. I looked at a poll that they brought me in Pittsburgh. In that poll I found that 37 percent, almost half, of the Republicans that had made up their minds were going to vote for responsibility, were going to vote for the present President of the United States on November 3d. They are not voting for him because he is a Democrat. They are not voting for him because he is a Republican. They are voting for him because they want to see this country united. They want us to be able to come here and meet in the square in freedom, not as Hitler's groups used to meet, not as they meet in the Communist squares under the commissars, but to meet here with freedom of speech, where every man has a right to his say, and you can listen to their voices, and by their acts ye shall know them."", 'We have a new government in Germany, Chancellor Erhard. We have a labor government in Great Britain that has only a majority of four votes. We have a new government in Italy. Only last week we found that Mr. Khrushchev was dispossessed and deposed and we have two men running the Soviet Union. The big question you have to decide is how can the United States formulate a policy and prepare a program that can get these people to learn to live in a world together without using our rockets and without dropping our bombs, and without killing humanity.', 'The Golden Rule says, ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" The Good Book says, the prophet Isaiah, ""Come now, let us reason together."" I am happy that most of you people have come out here this evening not to see a show and not to participate in a vaudeville, and not to try to attract any attention for yourselves. But you have come out here to look at your President, to listen to your President, to hear him talk about the issues, not the personalities, because it is petty men that deal in personalities.', ""The American people really don't give a tinker--don't care about what I think about my opponent, and I doubt that they have much doubt about what he thinks about me. What they do want to know is how do we feel about the bread and butter issues that feed their families; how do we feel about every man and woman having a job; how do they feel about the right of every child to have an education; how do we feel about the United Nations, which has prevented a dozen wars; how do we feel about trade with the world; how do we feel about space; how do we feel about technology and the leadership that California is showing to the rest of the world in all of her missile development and her space technology; and how do we feel about that most important thing: peace in the world."", 'I came here in 1924 to seek my fortune. I got off a T-model Ford over here at San Bernardino, and I stayed around there almost 2 years. I finally decided I had a better chance to get a fortune where I had come from than where I had gone, so I went back to my mother and my father.', 'I came back out here to seek your support for Vice President, and for 3 1/2 years I have served you as Vice President. The most memorable experience of that period was the Cuban missile crisis.', 'Our photographs showed us that the Soviet Union had brought within 90 miles of our shores enough missiles to seriously handicap and destroy large portions of this country. There were some people that said, ""Send in the Marines."" There were some people that said, ""Push the button; drop the bombs."" There were some people who said, ""Put your planes in the air and load them and tell them to put up or shut up.""', 'And for 38 meetings we met there in the Cabinet Room, morning, afternoon, past midnight many nights. Pierre Salinger sat in those meetings. The men with the stars on their shoulders who represent our Chiefs of Staff sat in those meetings. The admirals with the braid on their arms, they came, they learned, they saw, and they recommended. The Secretary of State with all his diplomatic experience, a Rhodes scholar, sat there with furrows in his forehead and tried to decide what course we could follow.', 'I never left home a single morning but what I thought I might not see my wife and daughters again that night, because we did not know when those missiles would become operational.', 'But during that whole period, the man that we have heard heckled and harassed, the man that we have heard in the last few days criticized when he is not here to answer himself, the man that was your President, your Commander in Chief, was the coolest man in that room, and his name was John Fitzgerald Kennedy.', ""He didn't shoot from the hip. He didn't talk first and think afterwards. He didn't get confused. He listened and he learned, and finally on the last hour as the clock was ticking and we were within moments of action, Mr. Khrushchev came in with a letter and he wrapped up his missiles in his tarpaulin canvases, he put them on his boats, while our helicopters flew over their decks, and we watched them take them out one by one by one. A war was prevented, a Republic was saved."", ""But what is more important, 300 million people live today that would not have lived had we not had the cool, calm, wise leadership of that man who watches over us in heaven this afternoon, John Fitzgerald Kennedy. He gave his life for his country, and there is not a man out there that wouldn't give his if he thought he could save his country by doing so."", 'But you are not called on to do that today. You are called on next Tuesday to go down as a free American, without restraint, without influence, without pressure, and act upon the basis of your judgment on what is best for your country.

Coming from Texas, where I do, that is really saying something. California has the biggest growth of any State in the Union.

Your beloved and great Democratic Governor Pat Brown reworked those plans and has carried on and has worked out new programs to solve those problems to the point that today California is the number one State in the Union. And your brand new Senator, Pierre Salinger, is going to come down to Washington, and with Senator Kuchel, and with your good delegation in the House, and with what I hope will be a Democratic President, we are going to continue to keep California moving.', 'You need Pierre Salinger in the Senate. I need him in Washington. The Nation needs him, because this forward-looking State must have a forward-looking Senator, not a turn back one. California must have a Senator who says, ""I believe we can do it, I am a \'can-do man\'"" instead of one who says, ""It is socialism. I doubt it. We have failed. Let\'s go back to the status quo.""', ""You need, and the Nation needs, Ed Roybal back in the House, where he can continue to fight the people's battles for the people's good.

I commend you for it, because no State in the Union can boast of a harder working, a more effective group of Congressmen than the State of California.', 'Now, I want to get down to a little business with you. This session of Congress that has just ended accomplished so much for just one reason: The responsible leaders of both political parties worked together for the good of the country. That is the way I think it ought to be. Pat Brown is a great Democrat, but he has carried on in the great tradition of a Republican Governor, Earl Warren. And that is the way it ought to be.', 'In the White House for the last 20 years, five Presidents from both parties have adopted a bipartisan foreign policy.

We have 72.5 million men and women working. They are drawing an average weekly wage of $104, the highest in the history. They are working fewer hours per day, fewer days per week, fewer weeks per month, fewer months per year. The corporations of this country that employed them in the last 12 months made $12 billion more after taxes than they did the year before, and I am glad they did, because the laborers that work for them made $60 billion more after taxes than they did the year before.', 'So we have peace in the world and we have peace between the employer and the employee.', ""We had a little argument up at General Motors, but it didn't last very long.

Our Navy was on the seas; they were ready.', 'But Mr. Khrushchev finally decided rather than to see 300 million people killed and the Soviet Union wiped out--and they could wipe out America, too--that humiliating as it was, it might be a little wiser to wrap up his missiles in those tarpaulins and put them on those ships and take them back home, and that is what he did.', ""We are going to educate our people, we are going to give them jobs, we are going to provide social security, we are going to give them more leisure time, we are going to improve the countryside, we are going to have more recreational areas, we are going to treat all Americans equally and then there won't be a single one that will want communism."", 'But in that time when we sat in that room trying to decide what was best to do, and even after it was over we didn\'t brag about it, we didn\'t say much about what had happened because we didn\'t want to provoke anybody and make it more embarrassing-we worked out the test ban treaty a little later, we worked out the ""hot line"" a little later, we worked out the agreement not to use armament in space a little later, we worked out the desalinization agreement a little later--what I want to say to you is during that period I sat across on one side of the table as Vice President and the President of this country sat across on the other, and I am proud to tell you that the coolest head in that room was John Fitzgerald Kennedy.', ""There are some voices going around talking about how he framed it all up, and they are making charges they didn't make in his lifetime. They are making accusations that he is not here to answer. But I think you are going to give them an answer loud and clear next Tuesday."", ""Economic and social progress are only a part of a President's job. Far above them and far above everything else is the President's inescapable and awesome responsibility that I just talked about in the Cuban missile crisis. His first responsibility, the only real issue in this campaign, the only thing that you ought to be concerned about at all, is who can best keep the peace?"", 'There are great and troubled changes going on in the world as we meet here. I heard about some of them in the trailer when I talked to Washington a moment ago, and when they break upon the world, the Government of the United States must act.', ""Mr. McNamara called me and told me that our destroyers had been fired upon, our flag had been shot at, and we had to act, and we did act in the Tonkin Gulf, but we had to think before we acted. In the nuclear age, the President doesn't get a second chance to make a second guess. If he mashes that button, that is it. So we cannot make a foreign policy, we cannot keep the peace by bluff and bluster and by threats and ultimatums."", 'We can keep the peace and we can only keep the peace by two methods: first, with a strong defense, and we are today, I tell you as your Commander in Chief, the mightiest nation in all the world; and second, we can keep the peace in the words of the prophet Isaiah, by reasoning together, by responsibility, by negotiation.', 'Strong defense comes first. As your Commander in Chief I have told you of how we stand with the other nations on this earth, stronger than all of them. And you helped make it that way.', 'President Kennedy spent $40 billion more on defense and space in 4 years than was being spent when he went in. That is why we are strong, and that is why we are going to continue to be strong, and that is why I am going to keep it that way.', 'But it is not enough to be strong. You must also be prudent, and you must also be wise, and you must also be firm, and you must also be reasonable. We must be brave. I admire a brave man. But there are some people that have more guts than brains, and we must be, above all, responsible. The stakes are too high to be reckless; you have too much to lose to be reckless.', ""Now, more than ever before in history, now in the nuclear age, now with the world-shaking changes, now that the Communists have the bomb, that is another nation that has it. We just can't afford to take reckless or needless chances. Somebody said the other day after the Chinese got the bomb that it would really be bad if both of them got it at the same time."", 'We must dedicate ourselves with all of our heart and all of our strength and with all of our intelligence, all our wisdom, all of our patience, to the greatest undertaking in the world. And what is that? Bringing the peoples of the earth together in enduring peace. ""Love thy neighbor as thyself,"" ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" No matter how long it may take, no matter how difficult it is, this above all else is the great horizon toward which we march united. I say united, Republicans and Democrats alike.', 'Do you know that Senator Arthur Vandenberg changed his isolationist record after he had been in the Senate many years and he went in to help President Truman stop the Communists in Greece and Turkey? Lyndon Johnson, as Democratic leader, went in and supported President Eisenhower in the Suez and in the Formosa Strait. I voted for his foreign policy 95 percent of the time in 1960, and the present Republican nominee voted for it only 25 percent of the time.', ""We must keep both parties trying to let politics stop at the water's edge. I have been in office 11 months. You make a decision next week whether you want me to have my first elected term, or whether you want me to go back to the ranch in Texas. I have read in the paper where some people do, but I just sure hope that they don't live in Los Angeles."", ""So let's keep a smile on our face, let's keep faith in our heart, let's keep hope in our vision, let's move on to conquer unknown frontiers. And let's leave this land a lot better for our grandchildren than we found it for ourselves.""]",1

Usted tiene muy buena ciudad aqui. Yo tengo muchos amigos aqui.', ""I came to New Mexico because I want my friends in this great and this growing State to understand the real, difficult decision that your President has in the real, difficult problem that confronts him. Eleven months ago I became your President, and since that time I have tried to pass programs for your people. But here in New Mexico you can help me. I flew a long way from Boston to Albuquerque after 5 o'clock yesterday to ask you to help me. Of course, I want you to vote for me next Tuesday. Of course, I expect New Mexico to be in the Democratic column. But more than that--and I think really more important than your being in the Democratic column--is for those of you who are building and planning and working for a wiser and a stronger New Mexico and a better America, I think that it is very essential that each of you go to the polls and vote for Joe Montoya so we will have two Democratic Senators to help us with our program."", 'You have a future in space, you have a future in atomic energy, you have a great agricultural future, you have minerals galore in this State, you have wonderful climate. The only real thing that you need is water, and Clint Anderson and I worked together many years ago on starting a program that will someday convert the oceans into ample water supplies for us all. We will make the deserts bloom. But the next Senate is going to have 65 to 70 Democrats out of 100, and they are going to sit over on the majority aisle.', ""I picked up your morning paper this morning and I saw where they had a rally out here yesterday for a Republican Senator. That is fine. I wouldn't say anything ugly about him at all. But it just seems to me that if I lived in a State that I wanted to move ahead, and I wanted my family to move ahead, and if I had a chance to get a person that had experience and had training, and could work with Clint Anderson, it just seems to me that you would be better off to have two men standing up in the Senate and fighting for your progress, coming down to the White House and uniting behind your State, than to have one man coming there and the other one standing up and fighting the President all the time. So I want you to know that I think this State needs Joe Montoya. I think this Nation needs Joe Montoya. I think I need Joe Montoya."", 'Mr. Rayburn used to say the reason Texas had a good delegation was, ""We pick them young, we pick them honest, we send them there, and we keep them there."" You picked Clint Anderson and sent him to the House. He did a wonderful job. You promoted him to the Senate. He became one of the great statesmen of the world. He is chairman of the Space Committee of the United States Senate now. Many years ago he saw space, but that wasn\'t too important, although it was very important. What was important, he saw the future.', 'You sent Dennis Chavez, as a young Congressman, when I went to Washington after the Hoover days. He came there and represented you with increased effectiveness in the House. Then you had him trained and you moved him over to the Senate. And until the day of his death he was always working for the people of New Mexico.', 'Now you have Joe Montoya. You have an investment in him. You brought him in, you have told him how to punch the time clock, you have shown him where his job is, you have told him what to do, he has the experience, he has been there working. You ought to take advantage of that experience and of that training and of that ability to work with Senator Anderson, and most important, to work with the majority of the Senate. The minority party--what good will 30 votes do New Mexico in the Senate? It takes 50 to pass anything. So I think that you can see through that, and I hope you realize that this is the only time you will get to make this decision for 6 years. What you do will vitally affect your future, and I think that most of you out there in the audience know that in your heart it is right to send Joe Montoya to the Senate.', ""I don't think Tom Morris has any problem. Tom Morris has problems in Washington, but he always comes down and all of us like to solve them for him because he is always loyal, he is always devoted, he is always diligent. I know you are going to send him back where he can continue to serve you."", 'I hope you elect Johnny Walker, who will be a worthy successor to Joe Montoya, and we will have those men working for New Mexico in the Senate.', 'One week from today the shouting and the talking is going to be over. I hope most of the counting will be done. We think we know what the counting is going to show. We think that it will show that this beloved country of ours believes in itself, believes in its strength, and its goodness, and believes in all that we have been doing together these past 4 years.', 'We think that it will show that the overwhelming majority of Americans want to keep on the present path to peace. The only real issue in this campaign is peace, how to preserve it, how to acquire it, how to maintain it.', ""We want to continue prosperity that today is in its 44th month, almost 4 years, the longest period of time in the history of America that we haven't had a recession."", ""We want to fight an all-out war against poverty. We don't like to see poor people. We don't like to see unemployed people. We don't like to see hungry people."", ""We want to build the Great Society of our dreams. Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery and we can abolish poverty. So let's get on and do something about it and give me the men to help me do something about it."", 'We think that that counting that will take place a week from today will show that the vast majority of voters in America believe that in this election those who speak for the Democratic Party speak for America.', 'But I say this: Anybody who counts on those votes before they are in the ballot box is gambling with his life and with the future of his Nation. The risk is too great, and that is why I have gone to 43 States in this Union since Labor Day, and those that I have missed Lady Bird and Lynda Bird and Luci Baines have picked up.', 'I met Luci coming out of the elevator when I was on my way to Boston, and I said, ""Well, where have you been, young lady?"" She said, ""I have covered the Dakotas, I have made speeches there, and in Nebraska, and it is pretty difficult country, but I think we are going to carry it, and I will be so happy because I haven\'t had a weekend of my own since last May."" Seventeen-year-old girls don\'t really approve of that.', 'I hope nobody here this morning and nobody in this country wakes up next Wednesday morning and looks over at their wife or their kinfolks around the breakfast table and says, ""Gee, I just wish I had tried a little harder. I wish I had worked a little longer.""', 'You know, down in Texas in 1941 President Roosevelt was very popular and he asked me to run for the Senate, because he said he needed me to help him, he needed another Senator to work for his program. And I went down there and we worked awfully hard. The morning after the election we led by 5,000 votes; and 3 days later we lost by 1,311, out of a million and a half. We lost by 1,311.', 'Then we waited 7 years, to 1948, when we ran again.', 'The night before the election I met Lady Bird--she had been campaigning in one part of the State and I had been campaigning in the other; we had been trying to cover every city--and I said, ""Come on, honey, we are going home and spend the night at the ranch.""', 'She said, ""Oh, no, we are not. I am going back to Austin and I am going to get your mother, your sisters, your aunts, and your uncles, your friends, and your cousins, and I am going to take the telephone book and I am going to assign one of them all the A\'s, one of them all the B\'s, one of them all the C\'s, one of them all the D\'s, right through the Z\'s, and we\'re going to call and say, \'Won\'t you please go to the polls and vote for my husband ?\' \'Won\'t you please go to the polls and vote for my son?\' \'Won\'t you please go to the polls and vote for my brother?\'--or \'my cousin?\'"" And she did that. She went through that telephone book--and we had another million and a half votes.', 'We had the highest percentage of votes in Austin in that area we have ever had before, because so many people said, ""Gee, I forgot to go vote. I have been busy. I thought I would vote and I would go to the grocery store, but I got busy washing the dishes and I haven\'t gone yet. Yes, I will go vote.""', 'We got out the highest percentage we had ever gotten out. I won the nickname of ""Landslide Lyndon"" because I won by the magnificent total, out of a million and a half, of 87 votes! And the Republicans have been talking about it ever since.', ""I have been thinking about it ever since, because if it hadn't been for that extra work that she and my mother and my sisters and my cousins put in that day, Texas would have lost a good Senator."", ""There is a lot at stake in this election. There are special concerns. People have different interests and there are special interests in various parts of the country. I know, as just one example of the special problem that you have here in New Mexico, because we have it down in Texas--we just don't get enough water. And we have a drought-stricken livestock industry. We know that New Mexico's cattlemen are facing a lot of trouble because I am facing it myself on my own ranch."", 'I buy my cattle out here in New Mexico, the best breeds, and ship them down to Texas, and then talk about what fine cattle we raise down there. I just have to make a confession. I buy them from a fellow whose judgment about cattle is a lot better than his judgment about politics. He is Albert Mitchell, who used to be Republican national committeeman. But he sure does have fine cattle.', 'I know the problem we all have with them, and we know the problem of breaking up the breeding herds because of no grass, because of no winter wheat, because of the cattle and feed prices. We have tried to do something about this. We have tried to do it in the Congress, we have tried to do it in the administration. We have allowed grazing on 180,000 acres of the cropland reserves. We have moved 120,000 hundredweights of grain sorghum, 34,000 bushels of corn. We have brought them in here at reduced prices with the freight paid.', 'We have worked out voluntary agreements with countries like Australia, New Zealand, and Mexico, which have been sending beef here. We have asked them to hold their beef and keep it off our market. We passed a bill on imports that brings us 25 percent below the 1963 level.', 'In August Congress passed, and I signed, a law to cover this situation that I just referred to in reducing the amount of meat we bring in. We have purchased over 300 million pounds of beef, more than $150 million worth, for the school lunch and needy families so we could try to hold up the price of cattle.', 'We have entered into agreements to sell 40 million pounds of beef abroad under the Food for Peace program. We have had our Secretary of Defense quit buying beef for our soldiers overseas, but to ship it from here over there, even though the cost may be a little more.', 'If more has to be done, we are going to do it, because I think that we know something about the cattle business in New Mexico and in Texas.', ""The business of the Government I think is the people's business. We are not going to turn our backs on trouble anywhere in this country. I think poverty in the midst of today's prosperity is a disgrace, and I think we ought to do something about it."", 'I think the denial of a complete education to any young man who can use it, or any young woman, is wrong, and we are going to do something about it. I think every boy and girl born in this country, regardless of his religion, regardless of his race, regardless of his region, has a right to all the education that he can take.', 'And Glint Anderson next year, like this year, is going to lead us up to the Promised Land where we have a medical care program for our elder citizens, and we are going to pass it through the Congress under social security.', 'There are 8,500 more jobs, 8,500 more, in New Mexico today than there were when our beloved President took office, the late John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Unemployment has been reduced and reduced and reduced down to where it is just a little over 3 percent. But this is still too much, and we are going to get the full employment that we have been talking about.', 'The tax cut bill will mean an additional $42 million of expendable funds in New Mexico, and an additional $14 million here in Albuquerque that we were taking in taxes that we are now sending back here. But if additional tax changes are necessary to get our economy moving faster, and our country moving faster, and getting us to produce more jobs, then we will consider making those changes in the next Congress.', ""We are going to make this system of ours work better and better and better. Part of the responsibility of Government is to see to it that it doesn't get in the way, and that it doesn't waste a cent of money or it doesn't waste a minute of time. But when there are things that we have to do together, we will work together, and that is what I am doing with your great Governor, Jack Campbell."", 'Government is not an enemy of the people. Government is the people themselves.', 'The greatest prospects, the greatest risks, that we will vote on next Tuesday, involve the future--the future of your children, the future of the peace of the world.', 'Only a year ago your children were drinking radioactive milk. The test ban treaty was passed through the Congress. Only 12 men voted against it. Our opponent did. But President Kennedy had the support of the Republican leadership and men like Senator Anderson and others, and they passed it, and now 105 nations have adopted it. The air we breathe and the milk we drink and the food that comes from our soil is all cleaner because of it.', 'So the stakes in this election are high. They are success, but more important than success they are survival, survival for you and your children. The issue really is, if you want to boil it down, recklessness against responsibility.', 'We cannot and we will not abandon the bipartisan foreign policy that the Republicans and the Democrats have hammered out together in this country over the past 20 years. The risk is too great.', ""We cannot and we will not abandon the test ban treaty to which I just referred, which is the world's insurance policy against polluting the air we breathe and the milk we give our children."", 'Already that policy has paid off more than you will ever know, and since this agreement was signed and the tests stopped, the dread strontium-89 and iodine 131 have disappeared from the environment. The amount of strontium-90 and cesium-137 has already been, in 1 year, cut in half. This is technical language, but what it means is that we can breathe safely again.', 'And one thing I want to thank you especially for is that wonderful sign of the scientists and engineers of New Mexico. You have some of the best in the world located here, and about the best supporters I have in the United States are the scientists and the engineers.', 'They work with their test tubes, they work in their laboratories, they are not political speakers, although I wish some of them would get on the television out here and tell you people the facts of life, because they know what is happening in the world; they have created these things; they have brought them into existence. They know the dangers. They know the only thing really important is survival.', ""I don't think we will listen to those who voted against that treaty. I don't think we will let them lead this Nation. I don't think we will give them that trust. Why? Because the risk to you and your children is too great."", 'We cannot and we will not play the war game of bluff and bluster. We want to speak softly and act prudently. We want to be prepared, the mightiest nation in the world, with all the bombers we need and all the rockets that are necessary.', 'But we don\'t think that we ought to rear back and throw out our chest and shoot from the hip and say, ""We are going to rattle our rockets and we are going to bluff you with our bombs, and we are going to issue ultimatums to all the other 120 nations that \'You do it like we do or else,\'"" because we don\'t think that will keep peace in the world.', 'So what we are going to do is to keep the strength that makes our adversaries sure that America can defend herself and will. We will keep the steadiness of purpose that makes our allies--and I saw the Foreign Secretary of Great Britain only yesterday morning--sure that we are going to be responsible. We will keep the course that makes our adversaries and our allies alike sure that the number one thing that we are dedicated to in America is peace on earth, good will toward men. We will keep the peace.', 'Now that, most of all, is what this election is all about, keeping the peace.', 'Which man do you think can keep the peace?', 'Which man do you want to have his thumb close to that atomic button ?', 'Which man do you want to reach over when that line rings, when that phone jingles, and it is the ""hot line"" and it is Moscow calling?

If God is willing and you approve, next Tuesday I will tell you what I told you that terrible night when I walked into the White House and that office was bare and our leader was gone: With God's help, with your prayers, I will do my dead level best to make this country safe and secure and prosperous. I believe in a nation where we have equal opportunity for all and special privilege for node."", 'You owe me nothing; you have already given me much. Next Tuesday you owe a lot to yourselves and to your family.

You ask yourself what course, what leadership, you think would be safer and saner for your Nation. And then, by all means you and your family go and register your vote, that priceless privilege that is not enjoyed in many lands today, and you select the kind of leadership that you think will weather the storm and that will carry us forward to peace abroad and to prosperity at home.

Kennedy. I am proud and I am grateful to have been a part of the campaign which proved forever that in America no man shall be denied the opportunity to serve his countrymen because of the region in which he lives or the religion which he has.', ""Tonight, America is a better and a stronger nation for all of us because of that campaign that we waged in '60. Philadelphia is a city of homes and families, just as all of America is a nation of homes and families, and in the life of such a city and in the life of such a nation, religion has always, and religion must always, play a part in all that we do or all that we hope to do."", 'I hope that the day will never come when any man, for any cause, will try to keep religion out of our national decisions on who shall lead us or the direction we shall go.', 'Thank God that Americans welcome into their homes and into the lives of their families the preachers and the priests and the rabbis who serve us all so faithfully and so unselfishly.', 'The men of the pulpit have a place in the leadership of our people and they have a place in our public affairs.

All of those men, from George Washington to John Kennedy, have worked and prayed and hoped for peace, for unity, for progress and prosperity for their people.

None could know when he spoke here how tragically short was the time that remained for his life and his leadership among us. But all who knew him know that you gave to him a gratifying moment which brightened his life to the very end.', ""President Kennedy returned from Salt Lake City knowing, as he had not known before, that the people of America supported his efforts to make this world safer for all mankind. For that gratification that you gave to him, by your affirmation of America's devotion to peace, I would like this morning to express to you my deeply felt appreciation."", 'Over these last 11 months, all of us have had occasion to reflect--reflect as seldom before--upon what it means to bear the burdens of responsibility that are borne by our particular generation of Americans. In that one awful and incredible instant last November, we looked deeply into the chasm of change. If what we saw together made us more humble, I believe it also served to make us more hopeful.', 'Men and nations learn from revelations. In that moment, it was revealed to us how much America means to mankind, and really, how much we mean to each other. In all of our purposes and pursuits since then, it seems to me there has been a growing will among the people to heal their wounds, to come a little closer together, rather than to risk having our society divided and coming apart.', 'This is the truth about America.

And in the days to come, I believe that it is this responsible heritage of the Republican Party that will emerge after this election to regroup, reform, strengthen, and return to the principles of high patriotic responsibility that marks the Republican Party's history."", 'So today I want to tell you, and through you I want to tell the Nation, that I want them to know and to understand that so long as Lyndon Johnson may serve as your President, I will share with them the opportunity as well as the obligation of saving America and saving our system of free enterprise.', 'I will share with them the opportunity and the obligation of bettering our working conditions, employing all of our people, raising our standards of living, increasing our strength, encouraging our growth. And remembering that it was this great State that gave to the Nation the man that abolished slavery 100 years ago, in these next few months I will give them the opportunity and the obligation to join me in helping to abolish poverty among humans.', 'Yes, it is not just the Democrat or the Republican or the Independent. It is all Americans that must pursue the search for peace in this unsettled world.', ""I have not forgotten that in one of our country's darkest hours, President Roosevelt called two great Republicans forward, and they stepped up to cast aside partisanship amidst great criticism, and serve in that war period as patriots. Those men were Henry Stimson, Secretary of War, and Illinois' own Frank Knox, under whom I served when he was Secretary of the Navy."", 'The dangers to freedom then were no greater than the dangers we face today.', 'On November the 3d, next Tuesday, I believe that this generation of responsible Americans, I believe that every mother in her kitchen, and every husband at his vocation, will remember that the free world and the Communist world are looking at us through a goldfish bowl. The spotlight of 3 billion people is turned toward what America does and who leads the world.', 'I think they will be reading our election returns, and I believe that Americans will, by their votes, say to the new leaders in the Kremlin and in Great Britain and in Italy and in Germany, and in India since Nehru is gone and Mr. Shastri has replaced him, and in Japan, where Mr. Ikeda has resigned--I believe they will say that America is going to have a foreign policy that unites all of our people instead of divides them, a policy that preaches love instead of hate, a policy that preaches faith instead of doubt, a policy that preaches hope instead of despair. I believe they will say that you can depend on America to stand solid and safe and united and steady on her course.', ""That will be the mandate--the only mandate--of this election. There will be no mandate for a man or for a party. There will be a mandate for progress. There will be a mandate for social consciousness, there will be a mandate for strength and responsibility in the policies and the purposes of the world's strongest and the world's most responsible nation."", 'Finally, it was just 2 years ago that I sat around the Cabinet table in the Cuban missile crisis. On one side of the President sat a Rhodes scholar, a great diplomat, who is Secretary of State. On the other side sat the former president of the Ford Motor Co., who left a half-million-dollar-a-year job to run the Defense Department, a Republican. Across the table sat Secretary Dillon, a Republican Secretary of the Treasury.', ""In that room we knew no parties. We knew we were only Americans. And Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Kennedy stood there eyeball to eyeball, each with a knife in the other one's ribs, and neither quivering or quaking. There was no palsy in their hands."", 'I never left my home a single morning when I knew that I would be back that night, or whether there would even be a Capitol or a White House.', 'There were those that said, ""Send in the Marines,"" and there is a gallant Marine that wears the scars of battle, Paul Douglas, who did go in.', 'There were those who said, ""Defoliate and drop our bombs."" There were a lot of hotheads all around the place. But as those generals came in with the stars on their shoulders, and the admirals walked down the corridors with the gold on their braid, I am proud to tell you that the coolest customer, the wisest man in that room, was the man that you, in your wisdom, the masses of the people, had selected to be your Commander in Chief, John Fitzgerald Kennedy.', 'I proudly served with him and beside him for 3 1/2 years.', ""I know not what the future holds. I can tell you only today, as I move on to Chicago, where I was due 30 minutes ago, that I believe you Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and whatnots realize that we are living in a critical period of history, and that you have a critical and important decision to make--not for me, because it doesn't make much difference to me."", ""You have given me everything a person could have. I was an NYA administrator. We worked with boys and girls. I was a Congressman for 12 years. I was a Senator for 12 years. I was leader of my party for 8 years. I was Vice President for over 3 years, as President Kennedy's assistant and his helper, and now I have been President for almost a year. But you will go and vote not for Lyndon Johnson and not for the Democratic Party. You will go vote for yourself and your family."", 'I know when I am sitting down there on the banks of the river in my little house near where I was born on the Pedernales River in Texas, and Governor Kerner or Paul Douglas calls me Tuesday night--I know that they will tell me that you voted for what you knew in your heart was right.']",1
71,Lyndon B. Johnson ,"October 30, 1964","['Governor Williams, Senator Hart, Governor Staebler, Members of Congress, ladies and gentlemen, my old friend Pat McNamara:', 'I am so happy to be back here in Detroit again. I want to thank all of you for coming out here this morning. You have made this a great Democratic rally for Detroit, and we are going to make next Tuesday a great Democratic day for Michigan.', 'Four years ago a young man stood on Michigan soil and asked for a chance to get this country moving again. His name was John Fitzgerald Kennedy. You gave him that chance and he got this country moving again, and if you will vote the Democratic ticket next Tuesday, we will keep this country moving again.', 'We have a lot of work to do, and I ask your help in doing it. I know you will send back to the Senate a man that we know, a man that we can always count on, a man that will work with his colleague, one of the great Senators in the Senate, Pat McNamara.', 'I want all of you to go to the polls early, stay late, and vote for Phil Hart all day long.', 'We have a House of Representatives. We have close votes. We have votes between the interests and between the people, and we need people who will come there and vote for the people. So I hope you will send back to the House of Representatives men and women who always have a record for voting for the folks. That is John Dingell, that is Martha Griffiths, that is Charlie Diggs, that is Lucien Nedzi.', ""But they are not enough. We need some more Democratic Congressmen from Michigan, and there is not a reason in the world why you can't send Weston Vivian and Billie Farhum and John Conyers and Frank Sierawski and Bill Ford."", ""I don't know whether you know it or not, but if you don't, you ought to: The whole United States is watching and waiting for you to elect a new Governor in Michigan, Neil Staebler. Neil and I don't mind working together, don't mind having our picture made together, don't mind standing for the same things."", ""I have known him for many years, in and out of Government. I knew him as a veteran of the last war. I know him as a dedicated leader of our party and this great State. I know him as an able, hard-working, responsible Member of the Congress, and I don't think that he is ashamed to stand up on the same platform with his nominee for President."", 'So if you will give us a Democratic delegation in Washington, and a Democratic Governor in Michigan, we will keep these people working and we will keep Michigan moving forward.', ""It is mighty nice to be welcomed by these candidates on this platform. I don't have the slightest bit of hesitancy about endorsing any of them, and I don't detect any hesitance on their part to come out here and be seen with me."", ""They tell me that the time is past in this campaign to talk facts and figures, and they say it is not good to talk facts and figures at an airport rally, anyway, but this wasn't a scheduled rally. You know, I got my arm twisted on this one. I am due in Milwaukee right now, but ever since this campaign began, I have had so many friends that made me do so many things that I have always run an hour late and a dollar short."", ""I received last night some figures that say a lot about one thing that I really think this election is all about. First of all, prices--prices of the things you buy--are up only one-fifth of 1 percent over August. This puts them only 1.2 percent above September, 1 long year ago. We wish that they weren't up at all, but what this record says is that we have the most stable price level of any single industrial nation in all the world."", 'This is going to be the first airport rally arithmetic lesson in the history of all of American politics. I suspect that some of you folks out there listening to me--and any of you that may watch the television that is recording it--are interested in wages and earnings last month. These figures are about prices and wages and earnings.', 'Weekly wages in September averaged $103.94. And that is the highest level in the history of the United States of America. I think I will interpolate a little bit here and say I think that wages like that are good for the workers, and I think what is good for the workers of this country is good for the United States of America.', 'But there is more. This September figure is $14.86 higher than it was the day our late, beloved President John F. Kennedy took the oath of office. That was some 44 months earlier.', 'But here is another comparison. If you take an average worker with three dependents and you calculate his weekly earnings and his taxes and the change in the cost of living, he and his family are $9.84 a week better off than they were in January 1961 when John F. Kennedy became President.', 'What does that mean? That is an 11.8 percent increase, really 12 percent increase, in these last 44 months. And then if you look at what happened to that same average worker during the preceding 44 months, he had a gain during that period of $1.31, or only 1.7 percent compared to 12 percent. You know which administration is best for you--1.7, less than 2 percent, compared to 12 percent, 6 to 1. So the improvement in that family situation during these 44 months is exactly a little over 6 times what it was during the preceding 44 months.', 'All right. That is the prosperity story, and I have tried to tell it in a nutshell where each one of you can figure it out in your own pocketbook. This is the pledge that I want to make to you: We are not going to repeal that prosperity and that progress next Tuesday. We are going to renew and extend that prosperity and that progress next Tuesday. And after that, we will talk about it again.', 'It was 35 years ago yesterday, on October 29, 1929, that the New York stock market crashed and brought the American economy crashing with it.', 'We have learned in these 35 years that the price of prosperity is not repeated depressions. The price of prosperity is only responsibility.', ""The prosperity of the past 44 months didn't just happen. It is the result of responsible management and responsible labor leadership. It is the result of responsible restraint about wages and prices."", 'It is the result of responsible Government policy, and as long as I am your President, I am going to spend my time trying to have peace in the world and peace at home. I am going to try to encourage business and encourage labor to work out their problems between themselves as they have here in Detroit, instead of having a Government harass them and put them in a straitjacket.', 'Then there was the Area Redevelopment Act that I think ought to interest you. I intend to ask the Congress to extend it and strengthen it next year, because no wise and no humane nation can ignore the depressed communities where their distress is caused by the reduction of job opportunities in privately-owned plants, the closing of public facilities, or other factors.', 'The partnership of the Federal Government with State and local governments and with private business is essential to lift up these communities and to help get their citizens off relief rolls and back on payrolls. This act will help us to make taxpayers out of taxeaters.', 'Again, there was the Accelerated Public Works Act that Pat McNamara has had so much to do with.', 'There is the Manpower Development and Training Act that has meant retraining projects for over 11,000 Michigan workers.', 'Then there is the increase in the amount of minimum wage, and its extension to over 3 million additional employees.', ""This year's Federal tax cut has already had a substantial effect, and the leaders in the State of Michigan had as much to do with helping us get that tax cut as the leadership in any State in the Union, and I want to thank them for it. That doesn't mean just political leaders. That means labor leaders, and that means business leaders."", 'Henry Ford and Walter Reuther smiled at each other and Pat McNamara and Phil Hart looked at that smile and decided they both better vote with me and pass that tax cut, and they did. It has made jobs and it has fed hungry mouths, and it has brought prosperity to every State in this Union.', 'When it is fully effective, here is what it will mean in Michigan: an increase in total income of over $1.3 billion a year, 89,000 new jobs, an increase in average family income of $476 per family.', ""Well, it just didn't happen. We planned it that way. We worked long and hard to get it done that way. We did it even though my opponent opposed it every step of the way. So we are prosperous in the United States today because we have been responsible in the United States."", 'That is really the basic issue in this campaign: responsibility for prosperity at home; responsibility for peace in the world.', 'I want to tell you about a new step forward that we are taking with the Peace Corps, which is another form of responsibility.', 'The AFL-CIO and 20 leading industrial concerns, some of them located here in this industrial State of Michigan, are working together with the Peace Corps to put into effect a program to use skilled American workers all over the world.', 'The Peace Corps is going all out to recruit the blue-collar worker to fill the needs for skilled workers in the developing nations. Ford Motor Co., General Motors, Chrysler, International Harvester, Mack Truck, John Deere, and other major United States industries, have instituted leaves of absence, policies that guarantee reemployment, seniority, pension rights to workers that volunteer for Peace Corps service.', 'These men will be invaluable to these new, developing nations.', 'And I will tell you, no one has done a better job with the new, developing nations than your own Michigan Governor--Soapy Williams. He and I have at least some things in common. We both outmarried ourselves and his wife has been helping him.', 'These new nations need people who can do things, who can roof houses, who can build buildings, who can fix automobiles, teach wood and metal working.', 'This program opens up a whole new field for the Peace Corps, and although the Peace Corps never was intended only for college graduates, many people thought it was. Sargent Shriver told me this morning that he plans to have at least 2,000 skilled workers in the Peace Corps before Christmas of 1965.', 'George Meany has appointed AFL-CIO Vice President Joseph Beirne to head the committee that will work with the Peace Corps.', 'Let me say just this much about the overriding issue of peace and war. For 20 years now a mushroom cloud has shadowed our lives. For 20 years every American President has worked to reduce that danger. Today we must work more urgently than ever before.', 'Harry Truman worked with the Republican Senator Arthur Vandenberg. Lyndon Johnson worked with the Republican President Dwight Eisenhower in the Formosa Strait and in the Suez crisis, just as Vandenberg worked in Greece and Turkey. Everett Dirksen worked with the Democratic President on the test ban treaty, John Fitzgerald Kennedy.', ""If you want to junk this bipartisan foreign policy and flush it down the drain, then you don't go vote next Tuesday or you go vote Republican, because we are not going to junk it if we have Democratic leadership. We are going to preserve peace in the world."", ""We have a problem not of creating tensions, but reducing tensions among nations. We don't believe the United Nations ought to be abolished. we believe that it has prevented many wars."", ""So today we must work ever more urgently and more earnestly to try to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. The peace depends upon our strength. As your Commander in Chief, I report to you today that the military might of the United States of America is greater than that of all the other nations in the world put together, but might doesn't make right. Peace also depends not just upon might, but upon responsibility in using it, and upon reason."", 'We, of course, must be strong, but we must not be reckless. We, of course, must be firm, but we must not be foolish. One miscalculated, impulsive, reckless move of a dingle finger could incinerate our civilization and wipe out the lives of 300 million men before you could say ""scat.""', 'That is what it means to be President of the United States in this nuclear age, and, really that is what is at stake in this election.', 'Jobs are important, schools are important, medicare is important--all of these things are important. But they fade into insignificance compared to the one overriding important issue, and that is peace in the world.', ""Yes, we are a mighty nation. We know it and they know it. We covet no one's territory. We seek to dominate no people. We know it and they know it. That is why you gain nothing form bravado; that is why you gain nothing from rattling you rockets and bluffing with your bombs. That is why you get nowhere by saying you'll lob one into the men's room in the Kremlin."", 'That is why I say to you most earnestly today that the United States of America loves peace and hates war, and we do not intend to be buried.', 'If your life was at stake, if your country faced a crisis, every man and woman out there would take their boy to the railroad station to see him go away to boot camp to put on that khaki uniform as they did in world War I and as they did in World War II. You are not being asked to do that today. But you are being asked to go not to the railroad station, but go to the polling booth and vote for what in your heart you know is right. The vote you cast will be your own, and the world that you save will be your own.', 'These rallies are nice. they give you a chance to see the people that you work for.', 'We have a wonderful setup in the country. Jefferson once said that the collective judgment of the many is much to be preferred to the individual decision of the few, and somehow or other, the people, the collective masses, know how to select their leaders.', 'Everyone running for office wants peace. Lyndon Johnson has no mortgage on peace. Everyone running for office, I think, is patriotic. I have no mortgage or monopoly on patriotism.', 'but the question you have to decide is which man\'s thumb you want close to that button. The thing you have to decide is when that telephone starts jingling and you hear the ring on the ""hot line"" and they say, ""Moscow is calling,"" you have to decide which man you want to lift up that receiver and what you want him to say.', '[At this point there was a demonstration in the crows.]', 'Wait a minute. They have already told me I have talked too long and I have go to finish. I want to tell you one more story.', ""That is not going to be any monkey business. that is going to be serious business. I will tell you why it is serious business. I don't know whether you had a newspaper strike out here 2 years ago or not. I hope you will get this one settled that you have had all these months."", ""I do want to commend the responsible leadership of the automobile companies and the responsible leadership of the unions for doing what is best for their country in working out their agreement. I appreciate the fact that we don't have a lot of men unemployed all over the country today."", 'They asked me what I was going to do about it, and I said, ""Well, I think that General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, and American Motors have some fellows that are experienced and know how to negotiate, and I know from some of my own experiences in this office that Walter Reuther knows how to negotiate, and I am just going to let them handle it between themselves, because we believe in collective bargaining.""', 'We are not going to repeal it and go back to the 19th century, either, and we are not going to make social security voluntary, either, and we are not going to be satisfied the rest of our lives with Kerr-Mills, either.', 'But 2 years ago, I guess, yesterday, we were meeting in the White House, and they were coming in the back gate, the Army and Air Force men; the generals with the stars on their shoulders; and the Navy men with the gold braid on their arms; and the distinguished Secretary of State, with all of his diplomatic experience, a Rhodes scholar; the distinguished Secretary of Defense that used to make a half-million a year as President of Ford--all of them with their briefcases bulging.', 'They were sitting there realizing that 90 miles from the United States we had missiles that were almost operational, and in a matter of hours and days could be touched off to destroy the industrial might of America. The question was what do you do about it? Well, there were some of them that were saying, ""Send in the Marines."" There were some of them saying, ""Drop your bombs."" There were some of them that said, ""Cut loose and let go.""', 'But for 38 long meetings we met there every day, and I never left home in the morning when I was sure I would see my wife again that night. That is how serious I knew it was.', ""The coolest man at that table was the man that the collective masses of this country had selected to be their Commander in Chief, and his name was John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Mr. Khrushchev with those missiles already moved in and located and set up, and we had pictures of them, literally held a knife in Mr. Kennedy's ribs, and it wasn't held by a hand with palsy. It was held pretty firm and pretty straight, and it protruded enough that you could feel it."", 'Mr. Kennedy had a knife in his stomach, and he kept it there. And hour after hour and day after day those two leaders of millions of people, affecting billions of people, were eyeball to eyeball, and every mother, every child, and every human being that had any sense was living in great doubt about tomorrow.', 'Because of that leadership and because of that judgment, and because of that experience, our Commander in Chief used power with restraint. He had his airplanes in the air and he had them loaded with bombs, and he had men that knew how to open that bomb bay. He had his carriers located at their proper places, and he had his Marines ready to jump out of those planes.', 'But he was cool and he was calm, and finally the break came. Mr. Khrushchev picked up his missiles, put them on the decks of his ships, covered them with tarpaulins while our helicopters flew overhead counting them.', 'That must have been a humiliating experience for him, but it was a great source of pleasure and joy and relief not only for our people but for his people, because millions of lives were saved because of good leadership and good judgment.', 'We all pray that we will never have to move that thumb toward that button again. We all pray that we will somehow, some way, learn how to live in the world with other people. But we do know that we have a new government in Russia in the last few days, and we do know that Mr. Khrushchev is no longer the leader of that country. We do know that the Chinese have developed a nuclear bomb, and that they have 700 million people to develop more of them.', 'So we do know that we are going to require leadership and we are going to require experience, and we are going to require judgment. Well, I am not here to say that I am the only man that has those qualities. I am here to appeal to you and ask you to appeal to your neighbor and your friends and your kinfolks and your uncles and your cousins and your aunts to be patriotic enough next Tuesday to go down there and search your conscience and exercise your judgment and vote for the man that in your heart you know is the leader of this country.', 'Thank you and goodby.']",1

And won't that be a wonderful day for all the country?"", 'Four years ago I came here one night with John Fitzgerald Kennedy, and he promised you that we would get America moving again. We have fulfilled that pledge. In fact, this administration has passed more legislation, has made more progress, has fulfilled more promises than any administration since the New Deal of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.', 'I came up here to New York tonight to tell you that we have just begun. We are going to keep moving forward. We are going to keep moving forward with the leadership and the support of the great State of New York.', 'The leaders of New York have always believed in the future. When I first came into the White House, I moved a desk into my office which had been used by one of the towering figures of American history, Franklin D. Roosevelt of the State of New York. I was so happy to greet his great manager, that ever youthful Jim Farley, who came up on the platform a few minutes ago.', ""And now whenever I feel that I have done a good day's work, whenever I feel that I have really accomplished something, I look at that desk and then I go back to work because I know I have only begun."", 'Franklin Roosevelt once said, ""Too many who prate about saving democracy are really only interested in saving things as they were. Democracy should concern itself also with things as they should be.""', 'So in this campaign we face those who are interested in destroying things as they are. These fellows are not conservatives in the American tradition. They are just interested in tearing down institutions, not in preserving them. They are dedicated to extreme ideas, not to old values. They advocate aggressive interference with other nations, not increased reliance on others to order their own affairs.', 'This is not a conservative philosophy. This is not even a Republican philosophy. This is not a philosophy ever embraced by any major American leader. ""Conservative"" may be written on their banner and in their books, but ""radical"" is in their hearts.', 'We were promised this time that the American people would be offered a choice and not an echo. This was to be a debate about basic principles.', 'And here, tonight, we are in the closing days of this campaign, and what do we hear? We hear not philosophy, but mudslinging; not ideas, but smears and scandal; not programs, but the old worn-out slogans of an old worn-out effort, written by the same old worn-out man trying to frighten the American people.', ""Well, I don't think you are going to let it work. Are you?"", 'I think I can tell you why they are doing it. They found out that the American people would overwhelmingly reject their ideas, would reject their programs. They found out that the great silent vote was a myth. They discovered that the revolution of the extremist was a dying ember.', 'They ran smack into the solid, good sense of the American people. They discovered, as far as the American people are concerned: extremism in the pursuit of the Presidency is an unpardonable vice, and moderation in the affairs of the Nation is the highest virtue.', 'They are going to learn their final lesson on next Tuesday night.', 'New York has had many great leaders. One of them has an important meaning for this campaign--that great American Al Smith. When he received the presidential nomination, he said he would follow the principles of Woodrow Wilson: ""First, the people as the source, and their interests and desires, as the text, of law and government. Second, individual liberty as the objective of all law.""', 'Well, today there are those who call upon us to abandon our historic principles under the pretense of pursuing that individual liberty which Al Smith prized so highly. And yet, time and time again, they themselves have struck at the foundation of our American freedom.', 'They call for freedom and then they attack the courts which protect that freedom.', 'They call for freedom and they would strip away the rights of those accused of crime, rights developed over centuries to protect against arbitrary power.', 'They call for freedom and yet accuse their opponents of being soft on communism or even worse, branding as heretics or traitors all those who ever disagree with them.', 'They call for freedom and they attack our religious leaders for trying to exercise their ancient responsibility--as clergymen and citizens--to guide people in the course of life.', 'But worst of all, they call for freedom and yet they help create the atmosphere of hate and fear and suspicion in which individual liberty faces its maximum danger.', 'Well, the American people prize their liberty too dearly. They have fought for it too hard to yield it now to these attacks. And somehow I think that you are going to help me make that plain in a few days.', 'We are going to take another course. We are going to work to enlarge the freedom of the American people, and we have the capacity to do that on a scale that is greater than ever before in the history of man.', 'Our first task is to complete the work of the last 30 years. So we will work to give every citizen an equal chance to hold a job, to vote, to educate his children, to enjoy all the blessings of liberty, whatever his color, his religion, or his race.', 'Will you stand with me on that?', 'We will work to eliminate the conditions which chain men to hopeless poverty, and in this way to eliminate poverty in America.', 'One hundred years ago Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery. Tonight, the Democratic Party pledges itself to abolish poverty in this land. We will work to protect the old and feed the hungry, and care for the helpless.', 'Will you stand with me on that?', ""But this is just the beginning. We are rich and we are powerful, but that is not enough. We must turn our wealth and our power to a larger purpose. Even the greatest of past civilizations existed on the exploitation of the many. This Nation, this people, this generation, has man's first opportunity to create the Great Society."", 'It can be a society of success without squalor, beauty without barrenness, works of genius without the wretchedness of poverty. We can open the doors of learning, of fruitful labor and rewarding leisure, not just to the privileged few, but we can open them to everyone.', 'These goals cannot be measured by the size of our bank balance. They can only be measured in the quality of the lives that our people lead.', 'Millions of Americans have achieved prosperity, and they have found prosperity alone is just not enough. They need a chance to seek knowledge and to touch beauty, to rejoice in achievement and in the closeness of family and community.', 'And this is not an easy goal.', 'It means ensuring the beauty of our fields and our streams and the air that we breathe.', 'It means the education of the highest quality for every child in the land.', 'It means making sure that machines liberate men instead of replacing them.', 'It means reshaping and rebuilding our cities to make them safe and make them a decent place to live.', 'Yes, it means all these things and more, much more.', ""I have already assembled more than a dozen groups, the best minds of America, the greatest talent that I could find, to help get the answers to these problems that I have talked to you about tonight. For the first time in man's weary journey on this planet, an entire people has greatness almost within its grasp."", ""This is the goal within our sight. This is your goal. This is America's goal. This is the goal to which I pledge that I will try to lead all of you."", 'I have taken a long journey from a tenant farm in West Texas to this platform in Madison Square Garden. I have seen the barren fields of my youth bloom with harvest. I have seen despairing men made whole with enriching toil. I have seen America, my America, grow and change, and I have seen it become a leader among the nations of the world.', 'In our early days, some thought that the Mississippi would be our final boundary. But farseeing Thomas Jefferson sent his explorers across the continent and the American tide rolled after them.', 'We, too, stand at the margin of decision. Ahead is the prospect of a shining nation of towering promise. Behind is a threatening tide of change and growth, of expanding population and exploding science. And there is only one way to go.', 'The only way to preserve the values of the past is to meet the future. The path to progress stretches in front of us, not back along the way we came.

They stand for the same things that we stand for. They try to raise their children the same way we raise ours. They come to the Congress and they try to work for their country and do what is best for their Nation.', 'I was going to the largest State in the Union today. I am going to tour Nassau County this afternoon, and we are going to close out the campaign in New York at Madison Square Garden tonight. I was asked to stop by here, so I got up a little earlier and finished some of my work at the White House a little quicker, and decided that I would drop by at Dover and Wilmington, and primarily say ""hello"" and thank each and every one of you for how good you have been. You have been good, you have been friendly, you have been kind, and you have been very helpful to me in the 11 months that I have been President.', 'First of all, Harris McDowell over here, your Congressman, is one of the few Congressmen in the Nation that has stood there and helped me pass a program for all the people, a program that in my judgment will help us to avert war, and a program that in my judgment will help us to maintain prosperity. So first of all, I want to thank you for sending Harris McDowell to the House of Representatives, and I hope you will send him back with a wonderful majority.', 'I have known Bert Carvel for a good many years. He is as solid as the granite that comes in our country. He is as friendly as any man can be. He believes in your State and he works hard for it. He has come to Washington several times on behalf of the people of Delaware. We need him in the Senate. We need him to help with our Democratic program of peace in the world and prosperity for all the people here at home. We hope that you will send Bert Carvel to Washington to help us as a Democratic Senator.', 'Judge Terry is your candidate for Governor. You have a Democratic Governor. A majority of the States have Democratic Governors. We are going to have, I think, more than 70 Democratic Senators in the next Senate. We are going to have a large majority in the House of Representatives. We are going to have a large majority of Governors in the States. So with the Governors working with the Congress, working with the President, we can make a real team to move this country forward. And I think Delaware wants to move with the country.', 'We all have our private catalog of grudges. Right at the top of my list is waste, w-a-s-t-e. More and more I think we will get the right answers to most of the questions that we face in this country if we in Government will declare a war on waste. I mean waste in all of its forms, and I am going to discuss them briefly for you because mine is not a campaign of personalities, mine is not a campaign of mudslinging, mine is not a campaign of charging my opponent with anything. I am not going to do any muckraking and name-calling.', 'We should deal with waste in all of its forms. A depression--and there are some of you out there that are old enough to remember the last one--brings tragic waste, economic and human waste.', ""The great depression 30 years ago cost this country, it is estimated, $600 billion. The three recessions that we had in the 1950's cost this country $70 billion, and 10 billion man-hours of productive labor. I think that is why we should keep our economy from going into periodic booms and busts and that is a major campaign front, the war on waste."", 'For Presidents and governments, as for all others, economy should begin at home. As a child, when I was growing up in a land where almost everything seemed to be in short supply, I learned some habits of thrift that are deeply imbedded in me. One of my first actions as President was to personally review the 1965 budget that was going to Congress. The result was that this budget became the second in 9 years that called for a reduction instead of an increase in Federal expenditures.', 'I need some help on that work. I need a good Congressman like Harris McDowell. I need a good, solid, economy-minded Senator like Bert Carvel. I hope that you will help me send them there.', ""In these past 11 months, since President Kennedy was assassinated, and since I assumed the office of President, we have made economy the first order of business in every department of the Government. We can't earn a penny in the Government, but we can save billions of dollars. And we have."", ""Last year, Secretary McNamara's cost reduction program in the Defense Department alone saved the taxpayer $2,800 million, and some of it was saved right out here at your Dover Air Force Base. I know you are interested in that base, but I know you are also interested in saving all the money that you can."", ""The Government owes the people the very best management of the people's business. I am proud to be able to tell you that the money that you are giving us to pay for our national defense is being spent wisely and is being spent prudently. I have insisted that all Government agencies step up their efforts to increase efficiency and reduce both employment and cost."", ""For instance, this last July we had 25,000 less Federal employees on the Federal payroll than we did July a year ago. We had reduced the amount by 25,000. Don't you think that is a good start? In another instance, I urged all agencies to cut out all unnecessary publications. First we eliminated 521 publications right off the bat. Then we canceled 133 that were proposed to be published. We effected, in addition, over 50 consolidations. We saved $2,796,640 by that act alone."", 'Management improvements and cost reductions in the nondefense agencies have yielded savings on an annual basis that amount to over $400 million per year. My special task force made up of able men that I called in and set up for this particular purpose has now recommended that we now put into effect an organized, formal cost-reduction program on a long-range basis in every single department and agency in the Government. And I am going to take their recommendations and we are going to do it. If you will help me, we will get results.', 'This means that each department and agency will adopt the same kind of program that the Department of Defense has adopted. I have called upon every Federal employee at every level, and particularly on their supervisors, to make cost reduction a personal goal, and to redouble their efforts to identify and to achieve savings through more efficient conduct of Government activities.', ""Spending by the Federal Government in and of itself is neither bad nor good. It can be bad when it involves overstaffing or duplication, or poor management, or the Government getting into areas where it doesn't belong. It can be good when it is put to work efficiently in the interest of our national strength and our economic progress, and our human compassion."", 'When budgetary restraint leads the Government to turn its back on new needs and new problems, economy becomes but another word for stagnation. But when vigorous pruning of old programs and procedures releases the funds so that we can have new opportunities, economy becomes the companion of progress.', ""I want to say this finally: The most awful waste of all waste is war. We believe in economy, but the falsest economy would be military weakness. I would not approve or I would not permit a cut in our defense budget of a single dollar or a billion dollars if it meant increasing the risk to one single boy's life. We will not be penny-wise and peace foolish."", 'I pledge a war on waste--waste.

And with your help, I think the United States has made good progress.', 'It was just 2 years ago this month that we were confronted with another serious crisis. It is just going to be a few days until you are confronted with the most critical decision that you may ever be called on to make. Two years ago Mr. Khrushchev moved his missiles into Cuba.', 'President Kennedy called the Security Council, of which I was a member, as Vice President, together. He called in all the generals with the stars on their shoulders, the experts that had graduated at West Point with honors, and the ablest men we had. He called in the Navy men with the gold on their sleeves, the Chief of Naval Operations, the Secretary, the ablest men we had. To his right sat the Rhodes scholar, the great Secretary of State. To his left sat the Secretary of Defense, who had left the Ford Motor Co. at a half million a year to take a $25,000 job to try to help his country.', 'We had 38 meetings. During all that time there were clamor, editorials, arguments, cool heads, hot heads, and some were saying, ""Send in the Marines,"" and some were saying, ""Drop the bomb,"" and all kinds of advice that was free was being received.', 'President Kennedy began his preparation. He put his planes in the air loaded with their bombs. He had strategic movements of the entire Naval fleet. He put everybody in the Nation on an alert. But he was cautious and he was careful and he was never reckless.', 'The coolest man that I saw in that room during those 38 meetings was John Fitzgerald Kennedy, your President of the United States.', ""Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Kennedy came eyeball to eyeball. Each had a knife in each other's ribs. Neither quivered. But neither rattled their rockets or bluffed with their bombs, or shot from the hip, because if they had, we could have wiped out 300 million in a matter of moments."", 'I never left Lady Bird a single morning when I knew whether I would be back home that night or not, or whether she would be there to greet me.', 'That is the kind of a world that we are living in.

I am not up here to say anything about my opponent or to say anything about his party, or to say anything about any of the people in his party. I primarily stopped off here on my way to New York to say ""howdy,"" to say thank you to you good people that have been my friends ever since I went to the Senate.', 'I have been here in Dover before. I have heard from a good many of you by letter. I know you have one of our great defense installations out here that I am interested in. But I do ask you, as I would ask you if we were at war and you had to carry your boy down to the railroad station to see him put a khaki uniform on to go to boot camp, I ask you to spend a lot of time thinking between now and next Tuesday.', ""The first thing you do Tuesday morning is get up and go and exercise the privilege that so many people in the world don't have--a private, a secret ballot. The citizens all over America will be doing the same thing. There will be 75 million of them."", 'I believe that it will be true, what Jefferson said, that the judgment of the many is better than the decision of the few. We saw the mistake that Hitler made when he was the only one to make the decisions. We saw the mistakes that Khrushchev made when he was the only one to make the decision. You must make the decision on who you want to lead you.', ""If you want me to lead you, I will do what I told you when I took this oath 11 months ago. I don't want to lead you because you owe me something. You have done everything for me that people can do. I served 12 years in the House, 12 years in the Senate, 8 years as leader, Democratic minority leader, Democratic majority leader with President Eisenhower, and Vice President for 3 ½ years, and now President for 11 months."", 'So that is not the question. You are not going to vote for that next Tuesday. You are going to vote for your family, for your wife, for your children, for your sons.', ""You are going to have to vote for what kind of an economy you have, whether you have a booming economy, prosperity, with people at work; whether you continue your social security and don't make it voluntary; whether you try to have some of the good things of life that you are having now; or whether you want to turn around and go backwards; whether you continue to have a bipartisan foreign policy, like Arthur Vandenberg, the Republican, worked out with President Truman, to stop the Communists in Greece and Turkey; like I worked out with President Eisenhower and followed him in the Formosa Strait and the Suez crisis; like Senator Dirksen worked out with President Kennedy in the test ban treaty."", 'That is what you have to decide. I am not going to try to tell you what your decision must be. But I am going to say this: if you want me to have that responsibility, you can say so. If you want to turn me out and not give me a first term, and just let me serve out the 11 months, that is your privilege.', 'But if you do want me to continue, then send me people who will work with me and who will help me, and who will join me and put our shoulders to the wheel.', ""Let's don't divide this country.

Let\'s try to reason out with them some way to avoid war, like the ""hot line,"" like the agreement in space, like the nuclear test ban treaty that President Kennedy worked out. All of these are small steps, but they are steps that can save you and make it possible for us to survive.', 'So when you go into that ballot box, take that lever and pull it all the way down and vote the Democratic ticket straight. Don\'t go in there and start messing here and here and here, and get your ballot all mixed up, where you don\'t know yourself how you voted and they can\'t count and they throw it out.
