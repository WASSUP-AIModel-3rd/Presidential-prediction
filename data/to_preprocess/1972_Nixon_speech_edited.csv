0,Richard Nixon ,"November 03, 1972","['Good afternoon:', 'Whenever people start talking about how exciting life would have been a century or two ago, a friend of mine likes to respond, ""But what if you had broken your leg?""', 'He has a good point. Nothing has done more to improve the quality of life in recent years than the progress of medical science.', 'I believe the best way to continue this progress in the future is to build on the system that produced our progress in the past.', 'We have done a lot of building in the last 4 years.', 'We have increased Federal spending on health more than 50 percent, from $16 billion to $25 billion.', 'I proposed--and the Congress enacted-the most comprehensive program in history to train more doctors and nurses and dentists, to train them faster and more effectively, to attract them to small towns and inner cities and other places where they are now in short supply.', 'In the last 2 years we have more than doubled Federal support for cancer research. We have stripped away the red tape from our cancer programs. We have made them directly accountable to the President.', 'We have taken new steps to fight heart disease. We have launched a new campaign against sickle cell anemia, a cruel threat to black Americans. Our program to prevent occupational accidents and illnesses has been enacted.', 'We have taken major steps to expand Medicare and Medicaid, to improve veterans hospitals, nursing homes, and emergency medical services, to protect consumers against unsafe food and drugs and dangerous household products.', 'Our campaign against drug abuse is 11 times bigger than it was 4 years ago. We are spending more than three times as much to fight hunger and malnutrition. We have established a national goal to cut the incidence of mental retardation in half by the year 2000.', ""One of the greatest problems we faced in the 1960's was the skyrocketing cost of health care. In that 10 years, medical prices went up twice as fast as the cost of living."", 'Just last week [October 27] I met with the Committee on the Health Services Industry of our Cost of Living Council. They reported that under our new economic policy we have cut the rise in medical care prices by more than two-thirds, from 6.4 percent a year ago to only 2.1 percent in the last year. The health care industry, once one of the most inflationary sectors of our economy, has become one of the least inflationary. Now to keep it that way we must balance the growing demand for health care with a growing supply of health services.', 'As I look back at the record of the past 4 years, I think of the comment which Dr. Jonas Salk made when he received a gold medal from President Eisenhower for developing the vaccine against polio. ""I feel,"" he said, ""that the greatest reward for doing is the opportunity to do more."" Well, I feel the same way today.', 'As we look to the future, one of our great goals is to make our health system more efficient--so that each doctor, each hospital, and each health dollar can do more good. The Federal Government is already taking the lead in demonstrating the effectiveness of medical assistants who help doctors with routine tasks. We also want to encourage programs which will help doctors organize their services more conveniently and more efficiently, with greater emphasis on keeping people healthy rather than treating them only after they get sick.', 'No American family should be denied access to adequate medical care because of inability to pay. The most important health proposal not acted on by the 92d Congress was my program for helping people pay for care.', 'This program would fill the gaps in many current health insurance programs.', 'For example, most working poor families-who do not qualify for welfare-cannot afford adequate health insurance coverage. Our plan would make adequate insurance available at no cost--or at a very low cost--for these families, families who work rather than who go on welfare.', 'Second, present plans often fail to protect families in all income levels against the catastrophic cost of major illnesses and accidents. They often have very restrictive upper limits, which means that the insurance often runs out while the expenses are still running up. Our program would provide broad catastrophic coverage.', ""Third, present plans often fail to cover services in doctors' offices. As a result, many hospitals are crowded with people who are there because that's the only way their insurance will pay their expenses. Our plan would change that, too."", ""Under our programs, every employer would have to provide all of his workers with a health insurance policy, just as he helps pay for workmen's compensation and social security today. The employer would pay at least 65 percent of the premium cost for the first few years and 75 percent thereafter. And our proposal would see that every policy provided good, sound, adequate protection."", ""One of the clearest choices in the 1972 Presidential election is the choice between the comprehensive health insurance plan, which is a private health insurance plan that I have just described, and our opponents' plan for a medical system which is paid for by the taxpayers and controlled by the Federal Government."", ""Let's take a look at the opposition program. According to a report prepared for the House Ways and Means Committee, its total cost to the taxpayers each year would be a staggering $91 billion. This means that health alone would take up more than one-third of the entire Federal budget. Look at this figure. The average family's Federal tax bill for health would go from $457 a year today to $1,305 a year, nearly triple, under their program."", 'There is another point worth noting: our opponents\' claim that all their new spending programs can be financed by sweeping cuts in defense and only a few new taxes. But somehow they managed to omit this $91 billion item from that painless version of their budget. A New York Times editorial was right 9 weeks ago when it described this as a ""major omission."" When that $91 billion is added in, their budget is nowhere near so painless. It would require a Federal tax increase of 50 percent.', ""Our opponents' federalized, tax-supported system would be very costly in terms of dollars and cents. But it would also be very costly in terms of the quality of American medicine. Not only would our pocketbooks be much poorer, our health care would be much poorer, too."", 'If the Government pays all the medical bills, then only the Government has a stake in holding down medical costs. This means that Government officials would have to approve hospital budgets and set fee schedules and take other steps that would eventually lead to the complete Federal domination of American medicine. I think this is the wrong road for America. It is the road that has been taken by so many countries abroad to their regret.', ""Rather than freeing the doctor so that he can do more for his patients, our opponents' plan would burden him with the dead weight of more bureaucracy, more forms, more red tape."", 'Rather than expanding the range of choice for doctors and patients, it would severely narrow their range of choice. It would concentrate more responsibility in Washington. It would dull the incentive to experiment and innovate.', 'Some people automatically assume that the plan that costs the most will help the most. But we cannot simply buy our way to better medicine. In this case the plan that costs the most is the plan that would actually do the most to hurt the quality of our health care.', ""Our plan would build on the strengths of our present health insurance industry. Our opponents' plan would eliminate that industry entirely."", ""Our plan would reform and improve our present health care system. Our opponents' plan would tear that system apart. This is one of the clearest choices in this campaign."", 'Building on the strengths of our present system, we can make tremendous progress in the years ahead. One development which will speed our progress is a new spirit of international cooperation.', 'When I was in Moscow last May, I signed several historic agreements. Perhaps the one that most people think of first is the agreement to limit strategic weapons. But it may well be, 20 or 40 or 100 years from now, that another achievement in Moscow will be remembered with it--our agreement to cooperate in the field of medicine. Let me give one example.', 'Take cancer. More people died of cancer in the United States last year than were killed in action in all of World War II as far as the United States was concerned.', 'Disease is an international menace. We must fight it with an international alliance.', 'Who knows who will discover the cure for cancer? It may be a woman now studying at a university in Europe or a boy who now sits in a South American school. It could be an American or a Russian or a Chinese. Or there may be many partial cures from many sources. But this we know: The cure for cancer-or any other disease--will come faster if we all work together to find it.', 'The barriers between nations may be great. But when it comes to improving health, our common interests are even greater.', 'Several weeks after the Moscow summit, the Russian Minister of Health came to the United States. One of the places he visited was Fort Detrick, Maryland. For years, Fort Detrick was one of the most secret places in our country, dedicated to research on biological warfare-perfecting the instruments of death. But last year we decided to convert it into a laboratory for research on cancer--dedicated to the preservation of life.', 'I visited Fort Detrick last year, on the day I announced its conversion. I directed that it now should be thrown open to scientists from all over the world. It was in that spirit that Fort Detrick welcomed the Russian Minister of Health almost one year later.', 'There he stood, in a place which once had been the symbol of a closed world, a world of suspicion and confrontation, a place where some of the best minds of our nation had prepared for a possible war against this nation.', 'Now this same place had become the symbol of an open world, a world of cooperation and trust. It had become a meeting ground where the best minds from every nation could work together to save life everywhere on earth.', 'We still have a long way to go--but our goal is clear. And for me its symbol is Fort Detrick, Maryland, welcoming the Soviet Minister of Health.', 'This is the kind of world we must leave for our children, a world in which the genius that split the atom and took us to the Moon is turned not to conquering one another but to conquering pain and disease, making our world a healthier, happier place for our people and for all people.', 'Thank you, and good afternoon.']",1
1,Richard Nixon ,"November 03, 1972","['Governor Ogilvie, Senator Percy, Congressman Arends, all of the distinguished candidates and other guests here on the platform, and all of you who have been so kind to, on such very short notice, come here to the airport to welcome Mrs. Nixon and me here:', 'I want to say to you that, first, to come to Illinois is always a very great pleasure for me. I want you to know, too, that to come here at a time that I know the city of Chicago is grieving for those who were the victims of the terrible accident 1 last Tuesday, is one that is a very sad time. But in a way it, too, is a time for hope for all of us.', 'I want to thank and express my appreciation to all of those who, during that tragedy, handled themselves so magnificently-the people in the hospitals, the firemen, the policemen. Lees give them the hand they deserve.', 'I want to express also my admiration for the people of Chicago, for the way they have reacted with great compassion and great sincerity and great heart. You know, this part of the country is known as the heartland of America. Chicago is known as the capital of the heartland of America, and the way the people of Chicago responded to this tragedy proves that Chicago truly has a big heart. We thank you for that big heart.', 'I am very proud, too, today to be here on the platform with others who are candidates for office, as I am. I would like to mention them all by name, but time will not permit it. May I say, first, that on the national scene all of them have my support: Chuck Percy, who is one of the top men in the United States Senate, one of the leaders of the United States Senate; the entire delegation from the State of Illinois. There is only one thing wrong with it. We would like to have a few more just like them back there in Washington. And we support the candidates, as well.', 'But when, out of this one State, you have two men in the leadership--Les Arends, of course, the Whip of the House; John Anderson, who is the chairman of the [House Republican] Conference--it is truly a great delegation, and I express my appreciation in their home State for what they have done for Illinois, what they have done for their districts, and what they are doing for the Nation.', 'Now, at the State level I have so many old friends--Bill Scott, for example; Bernie Carey,2 all the rest. They have my support. But could I say a very personal word about the man that I stood by 4 years ago and by whom I am proud to stand again, your Governor, Governor Dick Ogilvie.', 'As you know, at Independence Hall just a few days ago I signed an historic act, one which changes the flow of money and power to Washington back to the people, to the States and the cities of this country. Thirty billion dollars is going to go back into State government, into city government, and local government over the next 5 years.', ""Now, it isn't just enough to have that money go back. What is needed is to have leaders in the States, leaders in local governments, who will spend that money well for the people of this country, who will use it, for example, to reduce the burden of taxes rather than to increase it, which they could not have done until they received this revenue sharing."", 'I can tell you, I know every one of the 50 Governors in this Nation, Democrat and Republican. Without regard to partisanship, there are many who are very able men, but in the very top ranks of those that I would want to entrust my money to, to spend it well, to use it well for the people of a State, Dick Ogilvie ranks high. He deserves your support.', ""Now, having mentioned the other candidates, I would like to say a word for myself, if you don't mind, too."", 'I have been before the voters of Illinois now on five occasions: in 1952 and 1956, as a candidate for Vice President, and then in 1960 and 1968, and now in 1972, as a candidate for President.', 'I want to speak to you today about why I need your support. I am not going to ask for it in terms of Republicans versus Democrats, because this year we have an election, and what is important is not our party label, but what is important is what is going to happen to America.', 'I ask you as Democrats, as independents, and as Republicans to consider what you want for America. That is why we need a new American majority, to give us an overwhelming vote on November 7, and we would like to have it here in Illinois as well as in other States.', 'I could discuss at length many of the issues, the fact that we have moved toward prosperity without war and without inflation, a goal that we have not had in this country since President Eisenhower occupied the White House. I could speak to you of the progress that we have made in the fields like revenue sharing, in which power is returning from Washington to the people and to the States.', 'I could speak to you of what we have done in the field of the environment and health and education and all the many other areas in which we have worked. And I am very proud that during these past 4 years instead of running down the peace officers of this country, the President of the United States has stood back of them, and I stand back of them today, against those who would run them down.', 'That is why we have begun to turn the tide against crime and against dangerous drugs, because we need to respect those who are peace officers and those who have to carry out the law. Laws, of course, if they are to be respected, must deserve it. And we are going to have continually that kind of law, to have the increasing justice and opportunity that every American has as his due.', 'Today I would like particularly to discuss with you the issue that I know is uppermost in the minds of many of you because of recent developments. As you know, the major goal that I have had over these past 4 years is to build a structure of peace in the world, a peace not just for the next election, but peace for the next generation.', ""We have made very significant progress in that direction. I refer to the journey we took to Peking, where, after a quarter of a century of hardly any contact, finally the world's most prosperous nation and the world's most populous nation, with over one-fourth of the people of the world living there, now are communicating with each other."", 'Think what that means, not to this generation--ours---but to all of these wonderful young people here, because 20 years from now instead of being engaged in ugly and dangerous confrontation with a billion Chinese, they will be communicating with them. They have a chance for peace that we did not have.', 'We have made progress, too, in attempting to bring peace to the Mideast, in standing by our commitments to Israel, and we will continue to stand by those commitments, because that is the way to peace in that troubled area.', 'We have made progress, too, in many other areas in the world, particularly in dealing with the Soviet Union, where, as you know, we have had an historic arms control agreement, agreements in the field of trade and the environment and health and science and in many other areas.', 'I could stop here and talk about those agreements and also the progress that we have made in bringing the war in Vietnam to an honorable conclusion.', 'But my purpose in coming to Chicago is to ask your votes, not because of what we have done over the past 4 years, but to give me the chance that I need to complete the job and to build a structure of peace in the next 4 years.', 'Before coming to Chicago today I met for an hour in the Oval Office with Ambassador Dobrynin of the Soviet Union and the science minister from the Soviet Union [Dr. Mistislav V. Keldysh]. We spoke about the recent summit in Moscow, but we spoke about the future, how we could cooperate more in the future, and we also spoke about the new agreements with regard to the limitation of nuclear weapons, in which the negotiations will start at the end of November.', ""We spoke of the other negotiations which we have already begun, but which we must continue in the next Administration. I realized, as I talked to him, that it was important to go to the country and get the people of this country to give to the President of the United States the backing that he needs, to give to the President of the United States and to give a message to all the leaders of the world that when the President of the United States goes abroad, he speaks not from weakness, but from strength. Let's not have the President ever represent the second strongest nation in this world."", 'Let us also be sure that when the President of the United States goes abroad over these next 4 years, he speaks on the basis of pragmatism and reality and not on naive sentimentality that has always led us into war, or worse, in times past.', ""And let us also remember this thing: When we speak of peace, we want it; when we speak of ending a war, we want it; but let us remember we have ended wars before. The important thing is to end a war in a way that will build a lasting peace, and that is why I say, rather than peace with surrender, let's have peace with honor for the United States of America."", 'As I reported last night on television, we have made a very significant breakthrough in achieving that goal in our negotiations with the North Vietnamese. We have already reached basic agreement on the three major conditions that I laid down in the speech that I made to the Nation on May 8 when I ordered the bombing and the mining of Haiphong and North Vietnam, and those three agreements that we have already reached basic agreement on are these:', ""One, a return of all of our prisoners of war and an accounting for the MIA's; two, a cease-fire throughout not just Vietnam, but throughout all of Indochina, Cambodia, and Laos; and three, the right of the people of South Vietnam to determine their own future without having a Communist government or a coalition government imposed upon them against their will."", 'There are some details of the agreement that are still to be negotiated. I am confident they will be negotiated. I am confident that we will make an agreement. Let me address myself, however, to a question that one member of my staff raised this morning, to the effect that, ""Why are details important? Why not just make an agreement and sign it, because that would be really great just before the election?""', 'Let me tell you something. Rather than having simply an agreement before an election, we want to have a peace for the next generation, and that is what we are working for. I can assure you that as far as an election is concerned, it will not delay an agreement. I can assure you, however, it will not hasten it. The main thing is, we are going to have one, and it is going to be the right kind. I think the American people want the right kind of an agreement--peace with honor and not surrender. That is what we are standing for and that is what we will achieve.', 'Looking far to the future, we think of the younger people here and the older people, people who are black and who are white, people who are rich and poor, people who are employers and employees. We think of those that are respectful when they come to a meeting and all those that are disrespectful. All of them have their right to be heard, and so have I. But in that respect, I would simply say this word to all of you who are here: These next 4 years are years in which America has an opportunity such as I have not seen in my lifetime or that America has not witnessed in this century.', 'We can build a world of peace, real peace; something we have not had in a generation, and for a generation in this whole century. We can have prosperity without war and without inflation. We can have increased opportunities for all Americans to go as high as their abilities will take them without being limited in any respect.', 'We can have also a new period in this country of respect for the rights of others, of civility in our dealings with others, of decency, of carrying on our campaigns in a way in which we present the issues, in which we listen to what somebody else has to say, and then speak what we have to say.', 'Let me say finally to this great crowd in Chicago, it has been very proud, in terms of an experience for me, my wife, my family, to live in that great house that you saw on television last night. It has been a very proud experience to travel to all the 50 States over these last 4 years.', 'It has been a very proud experience to travel to 22 countries abroad, including four capitals that no President has ever been to before--to Peking, to Moscow, to Bucharest, to Warsaw. But I want you to know, in terms of that pride, what is even greater is the pride that I would feel if we can move forward on the beginning that we have made.', 'We are proud of our record. But we have so much more to do. We want to build a real peace. We want to build that real prosperity, and we need your support.', 'Let me say finally in that respect, I have noted that some have said--well, they look at the polls and they wonder really if their vote really matters.', 'You bet it does. First, the only poll that counts is the one that they do on November 7. Second, this is a great decision for the American people. It is the clearest choice this country has had in this century.', ""I say to the people of Illinois, Democrats, independents, Republicans alike, don't sit on the sidelines, don't have this great choice made by simply a minority that manage or bother to go out to vote."", 'Everybody vote, and as far as I am concerned, let me tell you this--and this has always been my attitude in politics--I have won some elections, I have lost some. When I have won them, I have tried to do the best I could. When I have lost them, I have pledged my support to this country and I will continue to do so in all the years ahead.', 'The important thing for you: Let us make this vote on November 7 a vote of a majority of the American people, and let the new majority in America speak out-speak out for peace with honor, speak out for a strong United States, speak out for prosperity without war, speak out for progress that means not bigger government in Washington, but better government, and government that belongs to you.', ""Let's make these next 4 years the best 4 years in America's history."", 'Thank you.']",1
2,Richard Nixon ,"November 03, 1972","['Ladies and gentlemen:', ""Thank you very much, first, to those marvelous bands, let's give them a hand for entertaining while we were here."", 'Second, I want you to know that when I come to Rhode Island, I feel somewhat like coming home, because it was 30 years ago that I spent 2 months in Quonset Point, and from here went into the service and then overseas into the Pacific. I always remember when I, at Quonset Point, used to come in to Providence, how very warm and generous and hospitable were the people of Rhode Island and of Providence to those of us in the Navy at that time. Thank you very much for what you did 30 years ago.', ""Now, on this visit, I would like to mention all of the fine candidates who are running on our ticket. Time will not permit it, but there are two here that I want to mention in particular. I mention them because they have been such splendid members of our Administration during these past 4 years. I am going to start with a man who was the Assistant Secretary of Transportation. I know that in that position that he was a dedicated public servant, but what was more, he was dynamic, he was strong, he was intelligent. He was a good organizer. We didn't want to give him up, but I think the State of Rhode Island needs him as Governor of this State, Herb DeSimone."", 'Herb, with you standing here by me, just let me say that in these next 4 years I look forward to working with you as Governor of Rhode Island, and that door will always be open for Governor DeSimone of the State of Rhode Island.', '[At this point, Herbert F. DeSimone spoke briefly. The President then resumed speaking.]', 'Now, turning to the national scene, I speak about a man that I know, and that you have known for many years. I remember when he was the Governor of this State and rated by all of the objective journalists as one of the top Governors in the Nation. I remember him, too, as the Secretary of the Navy in our Administration for 3 years. John Chafee, without question, is a man who was born to be in public service. He is a man that the Nation needs in public service. Let me just put it quite directly to you: Rhode Island needs him in the Senate, America needs him in the Senate, I need him in the Senate, and you are going to put him in the Senate. John Chafee.', '[At this point, John H. Chafee spoke briefly. The President then resumed speaking.]', 'Now, I would like to say a word for another candidate, for myself. I would like to say in that respect that I have had the great honor of being a candidate for the highest office in this land on three occasions, in 1960, in 1968, and again this year, in 1972. I lost the first time in a narrow election. I won the second time, and now comes the third.', ""As I stand here in Rhode Island, it just occurred to me that while in those elections to which I referred, in '60 and '68, I have at one time or the other carried most of the States, Rhode Island is a State that I have never carried. Let me say, the third time will be the charm. This is the year when we take Rhode Island."", 'I want to tell you why I believe this is a year when the people of Rhode Island are going to vote for the national ticket, for John Chafee, for your next Governor, Governor DeSimone. I want to tell you why.', 'This is not going to be a contest in which the people of Rhode Island are going to divide on partisan terms, Republican versus Democrat. It is going to be a contest in which the people of Rhode Island, like the people of this Nation, realize that this is one of those elections when what is best for America must come first, and the new American majority, Democrats and independents and Republicans together, are going to give America the leadership that we need in these next 4 years.', 'John Chafee has mentioned the subject which is closest to my heart and closest to the heart of all the people here. From the time that I was at Quonset and came out of Quonset as a naval officer, from the time that I finished my service in World War II, I have felt, as everyone in this audience feels, a deep dedication to the cause of peace.', 'I have realized that in this century this great Nation has been involved in war in every generation, and every time the war ends, we think, now we can have peace. But it has not been that way. The generation that fought in World War I saw their sons fighting in World War II. The generations that fought in World War II saw their younger brothers and some of their sons fighting in Korea. The ones who fought in Korea found their younger brothers and some of their sons fighting in Vietnam.', 'Let me say that is why we seek peace in the world, but we seek peace with honor, the kind of a peace that will lead to a lasting peace and not peace with surrender.', 'We have made a breakthrough in the negotiations which will lead to peace. I have referred to that breakthrough. I want to summarize briefly where it stands and to tell you why I am confident we are going to reach the agreement which will end this war and end it with honor and without surrender.', 'First, we have reached agreement on the three major principles that I laid down in my speech of May 8. First, that we are going to have a cease-fire throughout Indochina, not just in Vietnam but in Cambodia and Laos. We have agreed on that.', ""Second, we have an agreement that all of the American POW's will be returned and our MIA's will be accounted for wherever they are in Indochina."", 'Third, we have reached agreement on the principle that the people of South Vietnam shall determine their future without having a Communist government or a coalition government imposed upon them against their will.', 'What is left to be done is to work out some details on which there are still differences. Details, however, are important. They must be worked out in the fight way, because we are not going to have a repetition of what we had in 1968, when, with the best of intentions, the United States agreed to a bombing halt and when there was misunderstanding because the details were not worked out.', 'We are working out those details; we will work them out. We will succeed. But the most important thing is we are going to end this war and end it in a way that will lay the foundation for real peace in the years to come. That is what all Americans want.', 'Now, may I say a word about the role that you can play and the role that John Chafee can especially play in the United States Senate.', 'I met this morning, before I took off on a trip that took me to Chicago and then Oklahoma and finally here in Rhode Island, with a very distinguished scientist, the Russian minister of science. We discussed some of the negotiations we had had in Moscow in May when we made, as you recall, an historic and very important agreement limiting nuclear arms between these great powers.', 'We discussed also the fact that other negotiations are going to take place, very important ones, late in November, in which we will continue to try to limit nuclear arms between our two nations and thereby reduce the burden of arms and also increase the chances for peace.', 'As I talked to him I thought of this visit. As I talked to him I realized, and I want you to realize, that if we are going to be successful in negotiating with the Soviet Union and if we are going to have the kind of success that will have that limitation of arms that we all want, and progress toward peace, it is vitally important that the President of the United States not be sent to the conference table as the head of the second strongest nation in this world.', 'Let me tell you why that is important. Not for any jingoistic reason--because when the United States has the second strongest navy, as our opponents advocate, when the United States has the second strongest air force, as they advocate, and the second strongest army, it means that any incentive that the Soviets or any other nation would have to negotiate with us would not be there.', ""What we must do is to reduce our arms only when it is mutual. That is the way to build a real peace and not a temporary peace. John Chafee knows how to keep America strong. He knows that the most important element of America's peacetime strength is to have the strongest navy in the world. He built that kind of navy when he was Secretary of the Navy,. We need his votes in the United States Senate and his leadership to continue to have that strong navy that John Chafee has contributed so much to as Secretary of the Navy and will, also, in the years ahead."", 'I want to tell you, my friends, too, that as I look at this crowd, and particularly as I had the opportunity to meet so many of the young people as we walked along the fence here, I realized that all of your hopes lie in what happens in these next 4 years and thereafter. As far as those years are concerned, let me simply summarize by saying my hopes, I think, are yours. They are these:', 'I want a world of peace. I want a peace that will last; not one just for an election but one that will last for a generation or more. I want something, too, that we have not had since President Eisenhower was President--that is real prosperity, full employment without inflation and without war. We can have it and we will have it, with your help.', 'I want progress for America, for all Americans; opportunity for Americans; opportunity in which any American, regardless of his background, can go to the very top, where there will be ceiling unlimited.', ""And I want respect for America. I want the people of this country, and particularly our young people, to realize that we are very fortunate at this period in our history that we, the United States of America, have it within our power, that we have it within our leadership capability, to lead the way, the whole world, to a peaceful world. That is why the trip to Peking took place. That is why one-fourth of the world's people now, who had had no communication with the United States for 20 years, now have communication."", 'That is why we have negotiated with the Soviet Union. That is why we are working for peace in the Mideast. That is why in all of these areas I say, keep America strong, be sure that we see that the United States remains respected in the world. And we can do that by electing to the Congress, to the Senate of the United States, men like John Chafee, who understand peace through strength, and that is the message I leave with you today.', 'One final thought: On this last appearance that I will be able to make in this New England area, as somebody was saying as I went along the fence there, I asked a 13-year-old what he was going to do. He said, ""I am going to go into politics."" I said, ""What are you going to run for?"" He said, ""President."" I said, ""Fine. You should shoot high."" But then I gave him another bit of advice. ""The main thing,"" I said, ""to remember is, you don\'t win them all. I know. You win some; you lose some. But the important thing to remember is that particularly where the Presidency is concerned, America is bigger than any man and it is bigger than any party.""', 'I want to tell you, if I receive your votes and the votes of this Nation, I will serve as well as I can. If on the other hand, my friends, if on the other hand, the verdict of the people of this Nation should go to our opponents, then I will support what is best for America and not take the position that only if I win are we going to support whoever is President of the United States of America. The President comes first in the policies that he will be advocating.', 'This does not mean we will not have differences, but it does mean that in our system we debate those differences intelligently. We listen when others speak. We try to do everything that we possibly can to do the best job that we can in campaigning, and then in serving in office.', ""But once the campaign is over, let us have the statesmanship, let us have the ability to pull this country together and to work together for a cause that is bigger than any party and bigger than any man, and that is to make the next 4 years the best 4 years in America's history."", 'Thank you.']",1
3,Richard Nixon ,"November 03, 1972","['Thank you very much. To all of you who are gathered here inside the hangar, and to the thousands more outside the hangar, thank you very much for a wonderful welcome to the Sooner State.', 'When I scheduled this stop in Oklahoma, there were those who said ""Why?"" I am going to give you the reasons why. I remember saying at the time of the nomination in Miami that we weren\'t going to take any State for granted, and that we were not going to concede any States to the opposition. Oklahoma is one State that I have always carried, and we are not going to start losing it now.', ""Every time I come here to Oklahoma, believe me--I remember in '52 as a candidate for Vice President, '56, '60, '68--you just give me a wonderful lift. Thank you for that wonderful lift that you give me."", 'Now, there is another reason that I am here, and that is to express appreciation not only for your support in the past, but also to ask for your help in the future. Naturally, I am going to talk about what I hope for the future for those 4 years you are talking about, but I also want to tell you that one man, the President of the United States, cannot do that job alone. He needs help. He needs it in the Senate and he needs it in the House of Representatives. I want you to know that in Henry Bellmon you have one of the strongest, best, most loyal Senators in the whole United States of America.', ""I know, too, that Oklahoma is a team State. You produce great teams. You believe in teamwork. You don't like to have one man cancel out another man's vote. Let me say that during the years that I have been President, I have had the opportunity to work with many Governors. Of all the 50 Governors, in this State one of my closest friends, but more important, one of the ablest men that I have met in terms of knowing the problems of his State, of knowing the problems of this Nation, is Dewey Bartlett, and I think that Bartlett and Bellmon would just make a great team in the United States Senate."", 'You know, another thought occurs to me. When they call that roll in the Senate, they do it alphabetically, and when you have those two ""B\'s"" high up on the roll it might affect a few more votes right down that way, so we want them both.', 'Over in the House of Representatives, you, of course, have had fine representation from this State. I would not want to come here, even though he is not a candidate this year, without paying the appreciation of the Nation to Page Belcher for the great service he has rendered as a Congressman, and to tell you that I, of course, support all of our splendid candidates for Congress. I will not have the time to mention them all individually, but particularly here in Tulsa the man who was your former mayor, the man who has all of the qualifications to step into those big shoes of Page Belcher, Jim Hewgley for the United States Congress.', 'Now, with that, if you would permit me, I would like to say a few words for myself, not really in that sense, and not just for a party. What I want to say to you now is that next Tuesday we have an election which is very different from most elections in this country. Usually an election is just a contest between two men, each of whom aspires to a high office, with somewhat different views, but some of the same views. Usually a contest for an election involves a contest between two parties; one party nominates one man and the other party nominates another man.', 'Let me tell you, this year what counts is not the man, and not the personality and not the party; what we need is what is best for America; Democrats, Republicans all joining together for what is best for America.', 'I think, for example, of those next 4 years, and naturally I think of the last 4 years and what I want and what you want for those 4 years. I was so delighted to see all these wonderful young people, most of them will not remember what I said here. They will only remember, perhaps, that they were here. But what we say here and what we do in these next 4 years will determine their futures and your future. That is what this is all about.', ""In that connection, for example, as I said on television last night, I want them to have the opportunity and to have something we haven't had since President Eisenhower was President, and that means prosperity without war and without inflation. I want them to have opportunity-opportunity to go as high as their abilities will take them, and we have moved in that direction in fields of education and health and environment over these past 4 years."", ""I want them also, all of our younger generation and the older generation, to really have a deep feeling of love and respect for this country. Let me say, I have noted that some of those who are campaigning across this country are constantly running America down. Let's speak up for America and speak up for her on November 7."", 'But above all, everybody here in Oklahoma, like everybody in Illinois where I was a few hours ago, and everybody in Rhode Island, where I will be about 3 hours from now, wants the same thing for their children, and that is a world of peace. Let me speak to that subject for just a moment so that you can see what is really at stake in this campaign, so that you can see the great difference between the candidates and what your votes will do for that great goal of peace in the United States.', 'In the first place, we have made great progress toward our goal of peace with honor over the last 4 years, I refer, for example, to the trips that I took to Peking and to Moscow which mean that those great nations, instead of being in confrontation with the United States, while we will still have differences, we will have the opportunities to have a peaceful relationship with them.', 'I speak also of the progress we have made toward peace in Vietnam. I speak of the fact that we have brought over 500,000 home. I also speak of what you have all read about, of the fact that we have finally made a breakthrough in the negotiations to bring about a peace with honor. We have already agreed on major provisions. Listen to these provisions because they are the ones that I laid down in my speech of May 8 when, as you remember, I ordered the mining of Haiphong and the bombing of North Vietnam: First, we have agreed, have an agreement, that all of our prisoners of war will be returned and all of our missing in action will be accounted for. Second, we have an agreement that we will have a cease-fire throughout Indochina, in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Third, and this is a very important part of what we have agreed to, we have agreed that the 17 million people of South Vietnam shall have the right to choose their own government without having a Communist government or a coalition government imposed upon them against their will.', 'We have not yet signed the final agreement and the reason that we have not is that some of the details, some of the issues, are still to be finally worked out. I am confident that they will soon be worked out. Let me tell you what the election has to do with this. As far as the election is concerned, it will not have any effect in hastening us to sign an agreement that would be wrong and it will have no effect in delaying us from signing an agreement that is right.', 'Let me tell you, what is far more important than this next election is peace for the next generation, and we are going to have the right kind of an agreement.', ""You remember in 1968 when a bombing halt agreement was made just before an election. It was made with the best of intentions, I am sure, by the previous Administration. But because it wasn't nailed down in its details the war went on."", 'We are not going to make that mistake. We are nailing down the details. We are getting an agreement which will not simply be an interlude between wars, but which will lay the foundation for peace in the years ahead. I know that peace with honor rather than peace with surrender is what all of the people of this State want.', ""Now, may I come to a fundamental proposition that the people of Oklahoma have always understood in great numbers and that we in this Nation must understand if we are going to be able to build that era of peace that we want to build in the years ahead. There are those who believe that as we now negotiate with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and as we bring the war in Vietnam to an end, that the United States should drastically cut its national defense and then hope that the others do, too. Let me say this: I want all of you to know, I have sat for long days, day on day, in negotiations at the highest level in Peking and Moscow. They have been important negotiations. They have been successful negotiations. But they could not have been successful unless I was able to negotiate recognizing that I represented a nation that was strong and that was respected."", 'Let us now resolve that we shall never send the President of the United States to the negotiating table as the head of the second strongest nation--the United States of America. And so the issue is clear. The issue that you, the voters of this country--Democrats, Republicans, and independents--will all answer is this: Shall it be peace with surrender or peace with honor? I say peace with honor for America. That is what we stand for.', 'Shall it be a weak America or shall it be a strong America? I say a strong America.', 'Shall it be an America that withdraws from its responsibilities in the world, or an America that leads the way to peace in the world so that we can have peace at home? I say let us meet our responsibilities in the world. And also, as we look to the future of this country, let us remember that not only do we want peace for our younger generation and for ourselves, prosperity without war and without inflation, progress, but let us have in these next 4 years, as we come to the 200th birthday of this country, a restoration of something that Americans had in their youth and which we need now.', 'Do you remember when America was only 3 million people and 13 States, weak militarily and also poor economically? And yet that young America, 195 years ago, was respected all over the world. It was the hope of the world. Why? Because America then stood for spiritual and moral strength that could not be represented by military strength and that was stronger than any economic wealth and power.', ""Today America's military strength is unquestioned. America's economic strength is unquestioned. We are the richest nation in the world. Let us also remember that this is the time to strengthen that moral and religious heritage and principle in America that has made us the great nation that we are."", 'My friends in Oklahoma, as I said at the beginning, it is always a very great privilege to come here, to be received so warmly. It is also very heartening to know that out here in the middle of this country there are a people--a people who are strong, a people who have backbone, a people who will stand up for America, a people who believe in the religious and moral values that made this country great. Every time that I make a great decision, I know that I can count on the people of Oklahoma.', 'Thank you very much.']",1
4,Richard Nixon ,"November 04, 1972","['Good afternoon:', ""Through the long years of America's involvement in Vietnam, our people's yearning for peace has largely been focused on winning an end to that difficult war. As a result, there has often been a tendency to lose sight of the larger prospects for peace in the rest of the world. As peace in Vietnam comes closer, we can look to the larger world and the long-term future with hope and satisfaction."", 'Four years ago I promised that we would move from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiation. I also said that we would maintain our own strength and work to restore that of our alliances, because the way to make real progress toward peace is to negotiate from strength and not from weakness. Because we have done so, the world today is more peaceful by far than it was 4 years ago. The prospects for a full generation of peace are brighter than at any time since the end of World War II.', ""In the past 4 years, we have concluded more--and more significant--agreements with the Soviets than in all the previous years since World War II. We have ended nearly a quarter century of mutual isolation between the United States and the People's Republic of China. All over the world, the tide toward negotiation is moving. North and South Korea are negotiating with one another. East and West Germany are negotiating with one another. A cease-fire has been in effect for more than 2 years in the Middle East. The leaders of India and Pakistan are talking with one another. The nations of Europe, of NATO, and of the Warsaw Pact are preparing to meet next year in a European Security Conference, and preparations are underway for negotiations on mutual and balanced reduction of armed forces in Central Europe."", 'All this is evidence of solid progress toward a world in which we can talk about our differences rather than fight about them.', 'Nineteen hundred seventy-two has been a year of more achievement for peace than any year since the end of World War II. This progress did not just happen by itself.', 'In my Inaugural Address nearly 4 years ago, I said that the greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker, but I also pointed out that peace does not come through wishing for it, that there is no substitute for days and even years of patient and prolonged diplomacy.', 'For the past 4 years this Nation has engaged in patient and prolonged diplomacy in every corner of the world, and we have also maintained the strength that has made our diplomacy credible and peace possible. As a result, we are well on the way toward erecting what I have often referred to as a structure of peace, a structure that rests on the hard concrete of common interests and mutual agreements, and not on the shifting sands of naive sentimentality.', 'That term, ""a structure of peace,"" speaks an important truth about the nature of peace in today\'s world. Peace cannot be wished into being. It has to be carefully and painstakingly built in many ways and on many fronts, through networks of alliances, through respect for commitments, through patient negotiations, through balancing military forces and expanding economic interdependence, through reaching one agreement that opens the way to others, through developing patterns of international behavior that will be accepted by other powers. Most important of all, the structure of peace has to be built in such a way that all those who might be tempted to destroy it will instead have a stake in preserving it.', ""In the past 4 years, my efforts to build that structure of peace have taken me to 22 countries, including four world capitals never visited by an American President before--Peking, Moscow, Warsaw, and Bucharest. Everywhere I have traveled I have seen evidence that the times are on the side of peace, if America maintains its strength and continues on course. For example, ever since World War II, the world's people and its statesmen have dreamed of putting the nuclear genie back in the bottle, of controlling the dreaded nuclear arms race, but always that race remained unchecked until this year."", 'In Moscow last May, we and the Soviet Union reached the first agreement ever for limiting strategic nuclear arms. We signed that agreement last month in Washington. This was an historic beginning. It moved back the frontiers of fear. It helped check the dangerous spiral of nuclear weapons. It opened the way to further negotiations on further limitations on nuclear arsenals which will soon begin.', 'As we pursue these negotiations, however, let us remember that no country will pay a price for something that another country will give up for nothing. If we had scrapped the ABM missile system, as many advocated, we would never have achieved the first arms agreement with the Soviets. If we unilaterally slashed our defenses now as our opponents in this election advocate, the Soviets would have no incentive to negotiate further arms limitations.', 'Or take another example. After 10 years of recurring international monetary crises, we took bold actions a year ago to strengthen the dollar and to bring about a reformed international monetary system that would be fair to the United States and fair to the world. The result of these actions has been a solid and substantial beginning on just such a system, and the stage is now set for an international effort to achieve some of the most important monetary and trade reforms in history. As we complete these reforms in the years ahead, we can usher in a new age of world prosperity, a prosperity made even greater by the rapid expansion of peaceful trade that is now taking place, not only with our traditional trading partners but also with nations that have been our adversaries.', 'I cite these simply as examples of the broad, unfinished agenda of peace that now lies before us, the agenda of new starts made, of negotiations begun, of new relationships established, which now we must build on with the same initiative and imagination that achieved the initial breakthroughs. As we move forward on this agenda, we can see vast areas of peaceful cooperation to be explored.', ""We agreed in Peking to pursue cultural, journalistic, educational, and other exchanges, so that the world's most prosperous nation and its most populous nation can get to know one another again."", 'We agreed in Moscow to cooperate in protecting the environment, explore in space, fight disease. This means the day is fast approaching when a Russian cosmonaut and an American astronaut will shake hands in space, when a Russian chemist and an American biologist will work side by side to find a cure for cancer. And each time our nations join hands in the works of peace, we advance the day when nations will no longer raise their hands in warfare.', ""Throughout the world today America is respected. This is partly because we have entered a new era of initiative in American foreign policy, and the world's leaders and its people have seen the results. But it is also because the world has come to know America. It knows we are a nation of peaceful intentions, of honorable purposes, true to our commitments. We are respected because for a third of a century under six Presidents we have met the responsibilities of a great and free nation. We have not retreated from the world. We have not betrayed our allies. We have not fallen into the foolish illusion that we could somehow build a wall around America, here to enjoy our comforts, oblivious to the cries or the threats of others. We have maintained our strength."", 'There are those today who condemn as a relic of a cold war mentality the idea that peace requires strength. There are those who ridicule military expenditures as wasteful and immoral. Our opponents in this campaign have even described the great bipartisan tradition of negotiating from strength as one of the most damaging and costly cliches in the American vocabulary. If the day ever comes when the President of the United States has to negotiate from weakness, that will be a dangerous day, not only for America but for the whole world.', 'Those who scoff at balance of power diplomacy should recognize that the only alternative to a balance of power is an imbalance of power, and history shows that nothing so drastically escalates the danger of war as such an imbalance. It is precisely the fact that the elements of balance now exist that gives us a rare opportunity to create a system of stability that can maintain the peace, not just for a decade but for a generation and more.', 'The years ahead will not be easy. The choices will not be simple. They will require an extra measure of care in distinguishing between rhetoric and reality, between the easy temptation and the hard necessity. We will be told that all the things we want to do at home could be painlessly financed if we slashed our military spending. We will be told that we can have peace merely by asking for it, that if we simply demonstrate good will and good faith, our adversaries will do likewise, and that we need do no more. This is dangerous nonsense.', ""A heavy responsibility lies on the shoulders of those who hold or seek power in today's world, a responsibility not to court the public favor by fostering illusions that peace can be either achieved or kept without maintaining our strength and meeting our responsibilities."", 'As we approach the end of the war in Vietnam, the great question is whether the end of that war will be only an interlude between wars or the beginning of a generation of peace for the world.', 'Five months ago, I delivered the first television address to the Soviet people ever made by an American President. I tried to tell them something about America, about the people of America, about our hopes, our desire for peace and progress, not only for ourselves but for all the people of the world. In that talk, I repeated an old story told in Russia about a traveler who was walking to another village, who stopped and asked a woodsman how long it would take him to get there. The woodsman replied he did not know. The traveler was angry, because he was sure the woodsman lived in the village and knew how far it was. But then as soon as he had gone a few steps further down the road, the woodsman called out to him to stop. ""It will take you 15 minutes,"" the woodsman said. ""Why didn\'t you tell me that in the first place?"" the traveler demanded. And the woodsman answered, ""Because then I didn\'t know the length of your stride.""', 'In these past 4 years, we and the other nations of the world have had a chance to measure the length of our strides. At last we are traveling in the same direction toward a world of peace, toward an era of negotiation, and of expanding cooperation. In the next 4 years, the President of the United States, whoever he is, will negotiate with the leaders of many nations on a broad range of issues vital to America, vital to the world. As we cast our ballots next Tuesday, the world will see whether we have changed the length of our stride.', ""If you approve the beginnings we have made, then your vote on election day to support those policies will be a message to the leaders of all other nations that the American people are not going to retreat, are not going to surrender. It will strengthen the President's hand immensely as we continue to move from confrontation to negotiation to cooperation all around the world as we build toward a generation of peace."", 'Thank you, and good afternoon.']",1
5,Richard Nixon ,"November 04, 1972","['On behalf of Mrs. Nixon and myself, I want to express to all of you our really grateful appreciation for what is without question the greatest welcome we have ever received in North Carolina, and we have had some great ones.', ""We have appreciated the support we have had in the past. We remember how critical North Carolina was to our success in 1968. Based upon what I see today, we are going to repeat in North Carolina in '72, and even more."", 'May I say, too, that I am particularly interested to note what a beautiful day this is. Two or three days ago I was talking to Billy Graham on the phone, and he said, ""If the weather is good, give me the credit."" So, in any event, this is a magnificent day, and you have helped, of course, to make it even a better day because of your presence here.', 'On this occasion, I want to pay my respects, if I could, first to a man who is retiring from the Congress of the United States, a great servant of this State and of this Nation and a very close, personal friend of mine, Charlie Jonas. In paying my respects to him, I also want to indicate my complete support for all of those running for the Congress of the United States who have already been introduced. It is a great team. We would like them there in the Congress of the United States, and we will appreciate your support for them.', 'I also want to thank Roy Acuff 1 for entertaining you before we got here. He said to me as I came on the stage, he said, ""I think you are going to do all right in North Carolina,"" and he says, ""I can promise you Tennessee."" So there are two States we have, in any event.', 'Now to your candidate, our candidate for Governor, Jim Holshouser. He is a man I have known personally, have worked with over many, many years. He is one of those very well organized, dedicated men who has all of the attributes which would make him a fine chief executive of this State. I look forward to the opportunity of working with him in those next 4 years, when he is the Governor, and when, I trust, I am still in Washington, D.C.', 'On this occasion, too, I want to speak of another old friend. As a matter of fact, the friendship goes back even further than the one with Jim Holshouser, because at the time that we met, Jim Holshouser was perhaps too young to be in politics. I remember 21 years ago when I was a junior Senator from the State of California, and some way or other, when they allocated the office space, they put my office between two Senators from North Carolina. Clyde Hoey was on the one side and Willis Smith was on the other. They were fine men. They were great Democrats. But I found that I voted as they did because we were putting America above party, those two Senators from North Carolina.', 'A very young man--he was young to me at that time--Jesse Helms, came in one day to see me. He was the administrative assistant for Willis Smith. He brought with him a young man in a wheelchair, a very promising athlete who had been struck down by the polio epidemic of that year, as you remember, 1951.', 'I met him. We had our picture taken. I understand that Bucky Branham is still in that wheelchair, but he still is one who, with Jesse Helms, has that zest for life and has not given up because of adversity.', 'Ever since that time I have watched Jesse Helms. I have known his intelligence, his compassion, his dedication. I will simply state my position in a word: I know your interest, of course, always in the top of the ticket, but remember, to do the job we need Members of the Senate, Members of the House, who will support what we are trying to do at the top of the ticket.', 'In that connection, North Carolina needs Jesse Helms in the United States Senate. The United States--the Nation needs Jesse Helms in the United States Senate. I need him and I will deeply appreciate your support for this fine man in the United States Senate.', 'I have been quite interested, too, in some of the signs around here. I see one over there, ""Spiro Is Our Hero."" As we enter the closing days of this campaign, I would like to say a word about my running mate. I have often indicated my admiration for him and my respect, but I have noted that in recent days that the organized attempts to make him blow his cool, perhaps attempts to disrupt meetings on a scale unprecedented in American politics, have even gotten more, but let me say the test of a man is not when things go easy, but when they are trying to make it hard for you.', 'I simply want to say that I think all Americans are very proud that in spite of the disruption, in spite of the organized heckling, the Vice President of the United States has kept his cool, his dignity, and has come through it as the splendid man that he is.', 'Now I am going to suggest, so that we can give equal time here at this meeting, that our friends in the three television networks over here, ABC, CBS, NBC, who will have this on the program tonight, that they now turn their cameras to the few hundred that are over here. Let them see the kind of people that are supporting our opponents over here.', ""Now in the name of equal time and in the objectivity which I know all fair newsmen in North Carolina stand for, turn to the thousands over here and let's hear and see the kind of people that are supporting us."", 'As you know, I was very proud to have lived 3 years among you here in the Tar Heel State. It seems hard to realize that it was 35 years ago. Many of my friends, the best friends that I have, are from North Carolina. I learned to know them when I was at Duke University at law school.', 'Incidentally, when I was at Duke, I learned to respect all the fine schools in this country, North Carolina, North Carolina State, Wake Forest, Davidson--all of them.', 'But when I was in law school, having come from California and never been in the South before, I saw the South as it was then. I saw that the South was divided from the North. I saw, too, that the State of North Carolina was a heavily Democratic State where Republicans had no chance, usually, to win. It was a one party State.', 'I was thinking as the airplane came up today and I saw this enormous crowd, how things have changed. They have changed for the better. They have changed not in a partisan sense, but now we find--and this is the significant thing that I wish to emphasize to this great audience--that this country is no longer, on the great issues, divided in a regional sense.', 'On the great issues, it is not divided in a partisan sense. When it comes to keeping America strong, when it comes to peace with honor, we are not Democrats or Republicans or Southerners or Northerners-we are Americans. That is the way the people of North Carolina feel.', ""That is why in this State which, according to registration, is far more Democratic than Republican, we have support that crosses the party line. Because whether it is here in North Carolina or whether it was in Rhode Island where we were last night or whether it was in Oklahoma City where we were at 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon or whether it was in Illinois where we were at noon yesterday, you can go to the East, to the North, to the South, or the Far West where we will be this afternoon in California, and you will find that Americans are joining together in a new American majority standing for issues that are above party and above regional differences."", 'One of the issues that joins us together is the desire, a desire that is heartfelt throughout all of this country, for peace with honor for America and the world.', 'As you know, we have made a major breakthrough in the negotiations which can lead to that peace with honor. In making that breakthrough I want to point out that we have reached agreement on the three fundamental principles that I laid down on May 8 when, as you recall, I ordered the bombing of North Vietnam and the mining of Haiphong.', 'Those three conditions on which we have reached agreement are these: one, all of our prisoners of war and those who are missing in action, all of our prisoners of war will be returned, those missing in action will be accounted for; two, we have reached agreement that there should be a cease-fire, not only in South Vietnam but in Cambodia and Laos, all over Southeast Asia; and third, we have reached agreement on the fundamental point that the people of South Vietnam should have the right to determine their own future without having a Communist government or a coalition government imposed upon them against their will.', 'There are some details that are still to be negotiated. We are going to negotiate them. I want to tell you why. Because in reaching an agreement like this we want to be sure that it is not just a case of peace now but peace in the years ahead. We want peace that will last and we want to be sure that as far as the details are concerned, all of the misunderstandings are removed now.', 'Let me take you back 4 years. You remember the bombing halt in 1968. You remember it was entered into with the very best of intentions by those who made it. But you remember also that it did not lead to peace; it simply led to a continuation of the war. There was a misunderstanding. What we are doing is insisting on continuing the negotiation on which we have basic agreement on the major principles that I have mentioned, but continue it until the details are worked out.', 'We are confident we can achieve that goal, but it will be a goal that we then can be proud to say is peace with honor, not peace with surrender, a peace that will last for the United States and for the world.', ""In that connection, the day before yesterday the mayor of Erie, Pennsylvania, a Democrat, came in to see me. He indicated his support of our ticket in his State. His wife was with him. His wife's brother had been killed in Vietnam 4 days after the bombing halt. She showed me his picture, a fine young man, a major in the United States Army. She told me about him. She said that she had received a letter from him just before his death. That letter indicated at that point support for what I was trying to advocate at that time in the campaign."", 'Then she said to me, ""Mr. President, we all want peace, but above everything else, we want a real peace. We want a peace that will last. We want peace with honor. We want to be sure that he died, and others died, for a cause that will serve this country and serve it well.""', 'Let me tell you: We are keeping that pledge to those who gave their lives so that America could survive as a country of peace. There is one other thought that occurred to me as she was talking to me. I think of the fact that during this very long and difficult war, a war which began 5 years before I ever came to office, but during the whole course of this long and difficult war, over 2½ million young Americans, when they had to make a decision, chose to serve their country in Vietnam, and they deserve our respect and our honor for having made that choice.', 'Some of those 2½ million, many of them, gave their lives for their choice, as did the brother of the wife of the mayor of Erie, Pennsylvania. A few hundred chose to desert America. I say they must pay the penalty for their choice. When this war is over, there will be no amnesty for draft dodgers or deserters. So I say to you, I gave you three of the major issues in this campaign: We stand for peace with honor versus peace with surrender. We stand for a strong America versus a weak America. We stand for no amnesty for draft dodgers and deserters. This is what we believe Americans stand for across this Nation.', 'But beyond this, we must also realize that what we are trying to build is not simply the end of a war, but a new kind of life here in the United States. I see all of the wonderful young people that are here, the Grimsley High School Band and the others. I think of your future. We want you to grow up in a world of peace, but we also want it to be a world in which we can have what we have not had since President Eisenhower was President, and that means progress with full employment but without war and without inflation. We are moving toward that, and we ask for your help to give us the chance to continue to find that kind of prosperity for America.', 'We also want progress. That means better schools, better housing, opportunity, opportunity for every young American, whatever his background, to go to the top with the ceiling unlimited. All of these things we stand for. All of these things we have made great progress in. And we believe in justice, and when we speak of justice, I say that I am proud of the men I have appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States, and we are going to appoint other men who will stand for the forces of law and order and justice, because it is time that we strengthened the peace forces as against the criminal forces in the United States of America.', 'Now, if I could take you a bit further beyond simply these material things I have been talking about, beyond ending a war and bringing the peace that we all want, beyond the prosperity without war and without inflation, the progress in all these other areas which we, as Americans want, let me tell you that the future is bright for America. It is bright because the world is different. We, you, all of us, have helped to change it in these last 4 years, and particularly in this last year.', ""The People's Republic of China, where one-fourth of all the people in the world live, is now no longer isolated from us. That means that 20 years from now, when a billion people will be living there, they will not have to be our enemies. They can be our friends. That means a good and better life for young people in America."", 'We have negotiated with the Soviet Union to limit arms in the nuclear field and in many other fields. That means that despite the differences we have and will continue to have in philosophy, that we will talk about differences rather than fight about them.', 'Finally, it means that having opened up this great world, that the young people here--young as I was, and younger, when I was here in North Carolina as a student 35 years ago--can look forward to an open world where there can be communications between people even though there are differences between governments, where there can be peace in the world and progress such as we have never had in the whole history of mankind.', 'But it all depends, my friends, on you, because we must continue. We have started the negotiations with the Soviet Union. They must continue. We have started the opening to the PRC. We must continue. We are moving toward the prosperity that we all want, but we need to continue.', 'What we need from you and what we ask from you is your consideration of what we have presented here today. It is the clearest choice that we have had in this century. On that choice, I believe that the people of North Carolina, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, will say that America wants peace with honor, not surrender; America wants a strong defense, not a second-rate defense; and America will continue on a course, a course which will lead us into a new situation in the world, in which the people of the world, and particularly the younger generations, can grow up without the fear of war hanging over them.', ""I say to you finally, as I speak here, I feel very close to you, to the people in this State, for the reasons that I have mentioned. I feel, for that reason, a particular responsibility to you. I just want to say that in these next 4 years, I will dedicate myself to doing the things that I have talked about, but above all, I will never forget the faces that I have seen here, the wonderful people of North Carolina. We won't let you down.""]",1
6,Richard Nixon ,"November 04, 1972","['Thank you very much for being here and introducing us as you have to this wonderful crowd in Albuquerque. As you know, we started this morning from Washington, D.C. We were first in North Carolina for one of the record crowds of the campaign, and then arriving here this day in Albuquerque. I saw in advance that it was the opening day of hunting season and the homecoming game for the university, and I wondered if anybody would be here. Thank you for coming.', 'And although the Lobos1 lost today, speaking as one who knows how it is to lose and win, they will come back. They will win next time.', 'Also, may I say to you that it is a very great privilege to be here on this platform with the other candidates who stood here a moment ago, because this is truly a team effort. We often think of the President of the United States sitting in the Oval Office making the great decisions that affect the Nation and the world. But as you all know, he can only do the job that needs to be done with your help, the help of millions of Americans and also with the help of Members of the House and Senate.', 'For that reason, I am stopping here, because we are interested in what you, of course, will do, and how you will vote on election day, at the top of the ticket, but also, in asking for your support for the men we need in the House and in the Senate, so that we can do what America wants done over these next 4 years that you have been talking about.', ""If I could say a word, now, about Manny Lujan; Manny was one who seconded my nomination. I was not there, because, you know, the tradition is that the candidate is not supposed to go to a convention until after he is nominated, and I had to wait to make sure, but I remember seeing it on television. As I think of all the seconding speeches, the one that gave me the biggest charge was Manny's. I think it is the first time that a seconding speech has been given in both English and Spanish, and I understood the Spanish as well as the English."", 'As we went down the line and shook hands with the wonderful young people in the band and the other people, and received the welcome that we did, I must say that you made us feel very much at home. But I would like to put it in another way. We, I know in this State just like in my home State of California, have a great tradition, a background of Spanish speaking Americans, as well as people of all other backgrounds, and so, consequently, we pick up a little language here and there, even though we may not be of that particular background ourselves.', 'I remember, however, that when we, in English, say we want to welcome somebody someplace, we say, ""Make yourself at home."" But those who speak Spanish have a much warmer way of saying it. They say, ""Estan ustedes en su casa""-you are in your own home--and that\'s the way we feel today.', 'That allows me to say something that in all the years I have been in the Oval Office has meant more to me than almost anything else in terms of telling me what America really is. I remember one day Manny was in and we were talking about people of various backgrounds. Manny, of course, is, as he should be, very proud of his Spanish-speaking background. But he said, ""You know, Mr. President, we shouldn\'t talk about hyphenated Americans,"" and he is absolutely right.', 'So often, I know, we go around, you hear people say ""He is Italian,"" or ""He is a Pole,"" or ""He is a Mexican,"" or ""He is black,"" or whatever the case might be. Let me say every one of us is proud of our background, whatever it is, but most of all, we are proud to be Americans. That is what we are, and I speak to you in that vein today.', 'There were many reasons for coming to New Mexico today--the sentiment, the feeling, the fact that we have always had such a wonderful welcome here. But I wanted the opportunity as President of the United States to pay a bipartisan tribute to one of the great Americans of our time.', 'My daughter was here just a few weeks ago to participate in that tribute. I was unable to come. He is unable to be with us today, but Senator Clinton Anderson was our neighbor when we were in Washington and when I served in the Senate and later as Vice President. He was a Democrat. I was a Republican. But Clinton Anderson, during the years that I knew him in the Senate, was an American first and a partisan second--and a great American he was.', 'He was also like so many from this great State of New Mexico, these great Western States independent. That is a tradition of Senators from this part of the country--independent. A team player, but whenever he felt the interests of his State or the interests of his Nation required him to take a different position than the other people in the party did, he would take it. And he was known for that.', 'As I think of Clinton Anderson, he was a very big man, and it is going to take a very big man to fill his shoes. I have been thinking of whether there is a man who can fill those shoes--and there is one. It is Pete Domenici. He is the big man who can fill those shoes. I have known him, of course, when he has campaigned before. One time he lost. But again, having lost then, this time he is going to win, I know. I know that is what is going to happen.', ""But let's look at Pete for a moment. He is a Republican. But he is an American first. Second, speaking of that independent tradition, I have talked to him quite often about the problems of this State, the problems that he is interested in and he is a man who makes up his own mind. When he comes to Washington he is going to speak up for the people of New Mexico. He is going to speak up as he thinks the interests of the people of this State require, and that is the kind of a man you want, one who is independent, but one who above all, when the chips are down, when the great issues are involved, is going to speak up for America, and that is what Pete Domenici will do."", 'That brings me to the theme of what I would like to touch upon today, the fact that this is not one of those campaigns where it is party against party or one individual against another on a personality basis. This is one of those campaigns where there are great overriding issues that affect the future of this country and the future of the world, in which there is a great gulf between the two candidates for the highest position in this land, in which there is complete disagreement between the two as to what America ought to do, as to where we ought to go.', ""I want to state my position today. I want to say it not in terms of being against--let's understand what we are for. I want to start right out with the issue that I know is closest to your hearts as it is to that of every American, the issue of bringing peace to the world and for the United States to lead the way to peace in the world."", 'I begin, of course, with the progress that we have made in bringing to an end the war in Vietnam. It has been very significant. Most important, as you know, we have made a major breakthrough in the negotiations. We have already agreed, in the settlement, to the principles that I laid down in my speech of May 8, which you may recall was made at the time that I ordered the bombing of North Vietnam and the mining of Haiphong, at the time that the Communists were invading from the North. I said then that these were the three principles that we would have to have to have a negotiated settlement: First, that there should be a cease-fire. Second, that there should be a return of all of our prisoners of war and accounting for our missing in action. Third, that the people of South Vietnam should determine their own future without having a Communist government or a coalition government imposed upon them against their will.', 'Those three principles are agreed upon, and that is a major breakthrough in these negotiations. There are some details, as I pointed out on television 2 nights ago, in terms of the agreement, that are still in the process of negotiation. Those details, in my belief, I am confident will be worked out. We will have a negotiated settlement and a negotiated end to this war.', ""But let me tell you why details are important. They are important because what we want is not just peace now. Peace now is important. What we want is peace now and for the generations ahead, and we must have the right kind of peace. You may recall back in 1968 when, with the very best of intentions, the previous Administration entered into a bombing halt of North Vietnam and everybody thought we were going to have peace now. But we didn't have it down. We didn't have it understood. We are not going to make that mistake again."", 'We are going to have the kind of agreement which will end this war and build the foundation for a lasting peace that we can enjoy in that part of the world and all over the world. And that kind of peace, my friends--and let us understand what the issue is, and this is the basic difference between the two candidates--I say it shall be peace with honor and not peace with surrender for the United States of America.', 'Beyond that, when we speak of peace, let us remember that is one small part of the world. Our eyes have been upon it because of the long and difficult war that we have been engaged in, a war that started 5 years before I became President of the United States, and that we are now bringing to an end. But there is much more of the world, and you have seen that world, all of you, on television, more than you have ever seen it before, in this year 1972.', 'Why the trip to Peking? Why the trip to Moscow? The first time that a President of the United States has ever been in those two capitals. I will tell you why. It has to do certainly with my generation and all of you who can say you are in my generation. But it has even more to do with their generation and their generation over there.', ""Let me tell you what the world would be like if I had not taken the trip to Peking. One-fourth of all the people of the world live in the People's Republic of China, one-fourth of all the people. They are among the ablest people in the world. Their government is a Communist government. I do not agree with their philosophy. We will continue to have differences with their government. We will have disagreements with their philosophy. But if a billion people in the world, 10, 15, 20 years from now, were lined up in confrontation against the United States of America it would be a dangerous world."", 'I had to take the steps now to reduce that danger. We have done it so we have a better chance for a generation of peace for our young Americans.', ""The trip to Moscow was taken for similar reasons. The Soviet Union is also a nation that has a government that is different from ours. Their interests are different. Their philosophy is different. But they are a fact of life and a very important fact of life. They are, in nuclear terms, as strong as the United States of America. They are basically one of the super powers in the world. We were going down a track, a track in which we would inevitably confront each other at some time in the future and war might be the result. We couldn't let that happen."", ""So, on both sides--and it was on both sides--the leaders of the Soviet Union and the leaders of the United States met in Moscow. We didn't settle all of our differences, but we made agreements with regard to trade, we made agreements with regard to the environment, we made agreements with regard to cooperation in space, we made agreements--this one will not seem important perhaps when we think of the last one I am going to mention, the one with regard to the control of nuclear weapons--we made agreements, for example, with regard to exchange and cooperation in the field of health."", ""Let me tell you just what that means to this younger generation. We consider, for example, the dread diseases that afflict mankind. They don't just afflict Americans. They afflict all people, wherever they are. One of them is cancer. Did you know that last year more people died of cancer in the United States than were killed in action from America in all of World War II? So we are out to find an answer to that. There may be many answers, but my point is where it is going to come from. It may come from an American. It may come from a man or a woman. But it might come from a Russian or it might come from a Chinese. It may come from somebody in Africa or Latin America. What we must do, whatever our differences may be between governments, is to work together with other people in working against common diseases that afflict mankind, and that is why we have taken this giant step in both the Soviet Union and the United States to work together on that particular problem."", 'But perhaps most important, and most remembered by all of you, is the agreement that we entered with regard to the control and particularly the limitation of nuclear weapons. It was a first step and a very important one.', 'But now comes the second step. It is to get your approval and get your support for that second step that I come here today, for that second step and the second step we will take in so many other directions.', 'For example, we are now going to have negotiations beginning in late November with the Soviet Union to further limit nuclear weapons and reduce the danger of war. They will make this first agreement seem important, but they will not make it look nearly as important as it was, because it will cover more weapons than previously had been the case. It will be another great step forward toward reducing the burden of arms on America and on the Soviet Union, but, more important, in reducing the threat of war that hangs over us all.', ""I want you to know that in these next 4 years, whether it is in dealing with the Soviet Union or the People's Republic of China, or in bringing peace to the Mideast, a real peace, or in building better relations with our friends in Latin America or in Africa or wherever the case might be, we have made a good beginning. The chances for real and lasting peace in the world are better today than they have ever been at any time since the end of World War II. We ask for a chance to continue that job and to build that lasting peace, a generation of peace for all Americans."", ""Now, to build that, there are some things we are going to need. We are going to need a strong America, and here, again, we have a basic difference between the two men who seek the Presidency. I will tell you where I stand. I have sat across the conference table from the men in Moscow and Peking. I simply want to say to you, never send the President of the United States to negotiate with any power in the world as the head of the second strongest nation in the world. Let's keep America, in that respect, with the power that it has."", 'That is why I have to oppose, I have to oppose those who would make us have the second strongest navy, the second strongest air force, the second strongest army in the world, because when that day comes, it means that the threat of war in the world would be infinitely greater because the United States is the only nation in the free world that can deter aggression in the world.', 'It also means that any chance for reduction of arms or limitation of arms in the future is gone, because if you have already given it away unilaterally, they have no reason to give anything to you in return.', 'So let us be strong, let us be for peace, but let us be for peace through strength and not peace through weakness. That is what we stand for, and what Pete Domenici and Manny Lujan and all the rest stand for.', ""One other point that is related to this: We are moving, fortunately, to something that has been an ideal of mine, and I know of Manny Lujan's and Pete Domenici's and all of us here for many years, and that is, we are going to have a volunteer armed force starting in the middle of next year. In order to make that volunteer armed force work, however, it is necessary not only that they be paid enough, and they will be; it is necessary that those men and women in uniform in peacetime have the respect of their fellow countrymen."", 'In that respect, I simply want to say that as the long war in Vietnam comes to a conclusion, I, of course, think of those 2½ million Americans who served there. It was a hard choice for them, as it is for any who have to go to war. But they chose to serve their country when they had to make that choice. Many gave their lives for that choice. A few hundred, when they were faced with that choice, chose to desert their country, and they have to pay a penalty for their choice.', 'And so that there will be no misunderstanding on the differences between the two candidates in this respect, when the war in Vietnam is over, there will be no amnesty for draft dodgers or deserters, because it would not be fair to those who have served, and it is not the basis on which we could develop the new volunteer armed force, with the respect that we want, for developing the strength that America needs.', 'I have talked about this problem particularly because I know it is so close to all of your minds. Let me say, having reached the era of peace that we want, we want to have also with it what we have not had since President Eisenhower was President, and that is prosperity without war, without inflation. We are moving toward it. We need your help to continue in that direction. We want progress, but we want the kind of progress--programs for progress--that can be undertaken without increasing the tax burden on the American people. Your taxes are already too high, and that is why you are not hearing promises that are going to raise your taxes from me on this occasion.', 'And above everything else, we want opportunity for Americans, opportunity for every American--those first Americans that I had the opportunity to meet over here a few minutes ago, those who have come from other countries, those who are proud Americans who are more recently citizens--we want every American, whatever his background, every child, to have a chance to go to the top, ceiling unlimited. That is our ideal. We are working toward it. We can and will achieve it.', 'These are some of the goals we have in mind and today I come here to our friends in New Mexico and ask your support of those goals. It is on that basis, then, that I present the case. Not Republican versus Democrat, not one individual against another, but I say to you that when we talk about peace with honor, when we talk about strength for America, when we talk about opportunity for all, when we talk about prosperity without war, without inflation, when we talk about holding the line on taxes, those are issues that transcend partisan politics.', 'That is what America needs and that is what you are going to help us give America by your support in this campaign.', 'This morning I made a call to a distinguished Senator from Maine, Margaret Chase Smith. I wished her well in her campaign for reelection. As I spoke to her, I thought of the fact that it used to be said in politics that as Maine goes, so goes the Nation. However in 1936 that proved to be untrue. As you remember, in that year Mr. Roosevelt carried all the States except Maine and Vermont. So Maine did not go the way the Nation went.', 'I did a little studying before getting off the plane today. I found that since the time New Mexico became a State of the Union in 1912 that New Mexico has never voted for a loser. Let me say, you are not going to vote for one this time.', 'Thank you.']",1
7,Richard Nixon ,"November 04, 1972","['Governor Reagan, all of these very distinguished celebrities on the platform, and all of you very distinguished people in our home State of California:', 'Earlier today we visited the State of North Carolina and, of course, in California there is probably somebody from every State in the Union, but in North Carolina, as we were there, where we had a very great airport rally, I thought of a book that had been written by one of the great American novelists, Thomas Wolfe. Many of you have read it. You remember the title, certainly, ""You Can\'t Go Home Again.""', 'When we landed here today, knowing that it has been a little misty earlier in the day, knowing that the traffic has been backed up for miles, and when we look back on all of the appearances in this campaign, and when we see this magnificent crowd, we know you can go home again--to California.', 'Tonight I want to express appreciation first to Governor Reagan for not only his very gracious introduction but for the remarks that he made before we arrived, and for the work he has done in this campaign in California` and across the Nation.', ""I want to express, of course, my support for all of our candidates for the House, for the Assembly, many of whom I know have been introduced. I think you should know when the mayor, Mayor Snider, presented me with a plaque, that was because it was 12 years ago we finished the campaign here in Ontario at one o'clock in the morning, and we wish him well in his contest particularly here in this area."", 'I want to express appreciation, too, on this occasion, and I have waited now to do it because they have traveled all over this land, to this group of--well, we call them celebrities, but they are from California. They are some of the greatest names in show business; that is one thing. But they have also the greatest hearts and the greatest courage in show business, and we are glad to have them on our side. I think we should give them a hand.', ""Could I also express the appreciation that we all must feel for what, to me, is the greatest, and I have seen all kinds, of course, at rallies, bands and massed bands. Isn't that a marvelous sight, those massed bands behind us? How about a hand for them?"", 'And now could I take you back 12 years and relate what happened then to what can happen now? Twelve years ago, we finished a very long day of campaigning here in California. It was the last appearance of the campaign, as is this one.', ""I recall there was an enormous crowd here, not as big as this one, but it was late at night, at one o'clock, and it was quite cold. We were very heartened by it."", 'That year, in what was the closest election in this country, we lost the Nation but we won California. This year, based on the crowd I see here, we are going to win California and the Nation.', 'Could I tell you just a word about that Nation as I have seen it in just 2 days? As President, of course, I have had the opportunity, with Mrs. Nixon, to travel to 50 States, all the 50 States, the first President to have had such a privilege. But in the last 2 days we have really seen all parts of the Nation.', 'Yesterday we were in Chicago, Illinois, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and in Providence, Rhode Island. And today we were at Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and we were in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and now here in Ontario, California.', 'As you will note, we have covered the Northeast of the Nation in Rhode Island. We have been to the center of the Nation in Chicago. We have been down to the Southwest in Oklahoma. We have been in the South in North Carolina, and now we are in the capital of the West, California.', 'I want to tell you something about this country, and I particularly want all of you, the many wonderful young people here who--some are not old enough to vote, but you all will be---let me tell you something about this country: There was a time, and it was not too long ago, when if you traveled through the country you would see it deeply divided--the West against the East, the North against the South, and so on and so on, the cities against the farms, and so forth. But let me tell you, wherever you go, across America, this Nation is getting together.', 'I can tell you that whether it is in Illinois, or whether it is in Oklahoma, or whether it is in North Carolina or Rhode Island or in California, that across this Nation we find a phenomenon happening which is going to change the situation insofar as this country is concerned, and which is going to make this a better world for us as well, and it is this: An unprecedented number of people in this country are not thinking in regional terms, they are not thinking in partisan terms, but they are thinking in one term only: This year they are voting for what they think is best for America. That is what they are doing all across this Nation.', 'Everywhere I go, I find that people are united in what they believe is best for America. I want to speak about why they are united, and I want to ask you, my fellow citizens of California, to join people throughout this Nation--Democrats, Republicans, and independents in giving us the support that we need to continue the work that we have begun. We have begun, but we have much more to do.', 'I want to begin with that subject which, of course, is on the minds of everybody everyplace in this Nation. Governor Reagan has referred to the work that we have done to try to bring peace to this world.', 'We have approached this subject on a world scale in our trips to Peking and Moscow, and we have also worked on this subject in that area that has been nagging this country for so many years. When I came into office, we had been in a war in Vietnam for 5 years. There was no end in sight. There were 550,000 Americans there; 300 were being killed every week.', 'You know what has happened, the number that we have brought home, the casualties are down. But most important, finally we have had a breakthrough in the negotiations, and I can tell you today that the significant point of that breakthrough is that the three principles that I laid down when, on May 8, I ordered the bombing of North Vietnam and the mining of Haiphong for the purpose of stopping the Communist invasion of the South, those three principles have now been agreed to, and they are these:', ""First, all of our POW's will be returned and our missing in action will be accounted for; second, it has been agreed that there will be a cease-fire; and third, it has been agreed that the people of South Vietnam shall determine their own future without having a Communist government or a coalition government imposed upon them against their will."", 'Now we have a situation in which, having made this progress, we now must negotiate the final details. Those details must however be completed and be completed in a proper way. I want to tell you why. While the general principles have been agreed upon, we have often found in the history of settlements that unless you nail down the understandings and clear away the ambiguities you may get peace now, but not peace for the years ahead. We want peace that will last, not peace that will be simply for a little while.', 'You remember, for example, just before the election in 1968, when, with the very best of intentions, our Government agreed to a bombing halt in North Vietnam and we thought we were going to have peace or negotiations for peace. We thought so, but the understandings were not nailed down and as a result the war continued.', 'We are not making that mistake this time. I can simply say this: We have agreement on the general principles and I am confident we will negotiate the settlement which will end the war and bring us what we all want--peace with honor and not peace with surrender for the United States of America.', 'Now moving from that part of the world, which, although it is terribly important to the people that live there and to us because we have been involved there for so long, is only one small part of the world, let me tell you now what we have at stake in this election in terms of the other parts of the world.', ""I mentioned the trip to Peking and the trip to Moscow. I am going to tell you what they mean and to whom they mean so much. The trip to Peking, for example, has great meaning in one sense because it saw the President of the United States for the first time visiting that capital of the People's Republic of China. But it has meaning primarily, not so much to our generation, or mine I should say, but to this younger generation that we see here in such great numbers. Because, let me tell you, imagine how dangerous the world would be if one-fourth of all the people of the world who live in the People's Republic of China, 10, 15 years from now had gathered enormous nuclear capability and had no communication with the United States of America. We could not allow that danger to continue to exist."", 'I am not suggesting, and no one should believe, that there are not differences in philosophy, and deed ones, that will remain between our Government and theirs as long as theirs is Communist and ours is free. I am not suggesting that we do not have differences in terms of interests, but I do say this: I say that when we look at the future of the world we have to learn to live in this world in a way in which nations with different philosophies and different interests can settle those differences at the conference table and will not be involved in a nuclear war, and we have made a great step in that direction by that trip to Peking.', ""The trip to Moscow had a similar purpose. There we had a communication with the Soviet Union. We had had some progress. But look at what has happened this year. Here again, let us understand what the situation is. The Soviet Union's government is a Communist government. Our philosophies are totally different. They have different interests than we have in many parts of the world. That will continue. But again, imagine what we would leave to the younger generation had we not moved this year on that front. We would have gone down the road to an inevitable confrontation and a nuclear explosion, possibly, that would have destroyed civilization as we know it. I could not let that happen. You could not let it happen. That is why we went to Moscow. There we negotiated an historic number of agreements, agreements, for example, in the field of trade, agreements in the field of science, agreements in the field of space, and particularly those that you will remember, agreements to begin the limitation of nuclear arms."", 'But I again emphasize, it was only a beginning, just as the trip to Peking was a beginning. What we must do now is to go on from there and in going on from there what we must recognize is that just next month, for example, we are planning to meet with the leaders of the Soviet Union--our representatives--to negotiate the second round of arms limitation.', 'I am not suggesting that as a result of that meeting, any more than the first meeting, that all differences will disappear. But I do say this, and I say this as a message of hope to all of the wonderful young people here and your parents and your friends: that never since the end of World War II have the chances for peace for a whole generation been better than they are right today in the United States and in the world.', 'What we ask for is a chance to continue. What we ask for from the American people is a message to the leaders abroad, a message that the President of the United States, when he negotiates, has the support of the American people. We ask for that support in this election.', 'We also must recognize that in order to have these negotiations succeed to limit arms, in order for the United States to be able to play the role which we are destined to play, of building a peaceful world, it is vitally important that the President of the United States never be sent to the bargaining table with another country as the head of the second strongest nation in the world. We must remember that strength for the United States is vitally important to world peace.', ""I know there are those who say that we can cut our defenses so that we have the second strongest navy and the second strongest air force and the second strongest army and it doesn't really make any difference. But let me tell you, the day that happens peace and freedom will be in deadly jeopardy throughout the world. Let me say, keep America strong so that the President of the United States will represent a strong America and not a weak America."", ""Our thoughts, of course, turn also to our problems at home. We have moved forward to something we haven't had since President Eisenhower was President, and that is full prosperity without war and without inflation."", 'We have some way to go, but we now have the highest rate of growth of any industrial nation; we have the lowest rate of inflation of any of the great industrial nations. And we are going to continue on that road until Americans can have that opportunity that they have not had since 15 years ago when President Eisenhower was in the White House, and that is prosperity without war, without inflation.', 'We also ask you today for approval from my fellow Californians and for support in what we are doing in the field of fighting the rise in crime in this country and fighting dangerous drugs. It has to be done on all fronts, but one that is particularly important is in the appointment of judges to all the courts, and particularly to the Supreme Court.', 'Four years ago when I campaigned, I said that I would appoint judges who would recognize the necessity to strengthen the peace forces as against the criminal forces in this country. I have done so, but I have only had a beginning. We need 4 more years to strengthen the courts so we can have the peace forces strong, backed by the judges of this country, and if I could respectfully suggest you can help in this field, too.', 'I know that sometimes in recent years, in the late sixties, it became rather fashionable always to run down those who wore the uniform, whether it was a uniform serving their country abroad or the uniform of someone who was keeping our streets safe at home. Let me say: Back up the men on our peace forces in the United States, whether they are abroad or whether they are home. Give them the respect that they deserve.', 'There is one other great goal that I refer to today, and that is the goal of opportunity for all Americans. We in California feel so strongly about that because while we are the biggest State and the most populous State, we come from all the States and all the nations of the world. We believe in equal opportunity for everybody--an equal chance for the best education, an equal chance for good health, a chance for everybody to have a job, to go just as high as his talents will take him.', 'We want that. We can help in Washington in working toward that. We need your support to continue to develop that equal chance for every American, with ceiling unlimited as high as he or she wants to go.', 'And finally, may I say that as I look at this great crowd, I think of something else that we would like to leave during this next 4 years, something else in addition to peace which could last for a generation or longer, something in addition to prosperity without war and without inflation, to progress and opportunity for all Americans, and that is this:', 'I mentioned the fact that we have been to 50 States. Mrs. Nixon and I have traveled to 80 countries as Vice President and then as President. And in those travels as President of the United States I have visited four capitals that no President has ever been to before--Peking, Moscow, Bucharest, and Warsaw.', 'These were journeys for peace, but as those journeys took place, and as we saw those 80 countries, each time we came back to the United States and we saw this country, and we realized when we returned how very fortunate anyone is to live in the United States of America.', 'My fellow Californians, this is a great State, and this is a beautiful country. Oh, we have our problems, and we have those faults that we are trying to correct, but the wonder of it is, and the glory of it is that we have a system in which we can correct them in a peaceful way without resorting to violence, and that is the way we are going to do it.', ""I want you to know that as I look at America over these next 4 years and I think of your future, I believe that we have the chance--and this is our goal--to make the next 4 years the best 4 years in America's history. That is what I ask for tonight."", 'Now, if I could close with one personal note, I mentioned a moment ago that the last rally of the 1960 campaign was here at Ontario. Tonight, as I drove through this crowd, I was thinking back to the first rally I ever attended or spoke to. It was in 1945, November. That is quite a few years ago, before most of this audience was born. But as I was thinking back to that, I thought of how good the people of California have been to us: First to the House of Representatives for two terms, then the United States Senate, and then 8 years as Vice President, out of office for a period of 8 years, then back in office again.', 'But I want you to know that looking back over those years, in victory, the people of California have enjoyed the victory with us. In defeat, they have stood by us, and we are most grateful for that. This year we look forward to a victory, but as we look forward to it, we know that we owe it to thousands, yes, millions of people in this State and across this Nation that we will never get a chance to thank personally.', 'Tonight, as I speak to you here in Ontario, I think you should know that this, of course, not only is the last rally of this campaign that I will speak to, it is the last time I will speak to a rally as a candidate in my whole life, and I want to say to all of you here who worked on this, to all of you who took the time to come, thank you very much for making it probably the best rally that we have ever had.']",1
8,Richard Nixon ,"November 05, 1972","['Good afternoon:', ""Next Tuesday, for the 47th time in our Nation's history, Americans will cast their ballots to choose a President for the next 4 years."", 'Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a former member of my Cabinet and a gifted observer of the American scene, has made the comment that ""Elections are rarely our finest hours. This,"" he said, ""is when we tend to be most hysterical, most abusive, least thoughtful about problems, and least respectful of complexity.""', 'I think Americans want our democracy to meet a higher standard than that. We all want to make the election of 1972 one of our finest hours, and we have the opportunity to do so.', 'We need to recognize, first, that politics is not merely some kind of game to be played hard and played for keeps, with everyone defending his own interests as best he can. It is not just a competition in which one man or one party seeks to defeat another. It is not an auction in which the prize of office is awarded to the highest bidder for the favor of the voters.', 'Instead, in the highest sense, our democracy is a sacred trust which all of us who participate exercise together on behalf of those who cannot yet participate. One American in three--over 69 million boys and girls, young men and women--will not be old enough to vote on Tuesday, but they will live for the rest of their lives with the consequences of the decision we, the voters, make. Additionally, during the 4 years of the next presidential term, nearly 15 million newborn children will begin their lives in America--in a nation and in a world not of their making, but of our making.', 'I would like to spend a few minutes thinking with you this afternoon about the birthright we ought to guarantee for them. I would like to look beyond the election and focus on the things which I believe all Americans, no matter how they vote on Tuesday, will want their Nation to achieve in the 4 years between now and 1976.', 'The 10 goals in this birthright are not intended to be my campaign promises to you, for they are not something which any one man, by himself, could hope to deliver. To achieve them, all Americans must join hands and work together.', 'So we might think of these goals as campaign promises which America should make to itself, promises to be honored in the next 4 years, no matter who wins in the next 2 days.', ""First, let us give tomorrow's children the birthright of an America at peace in a world at peace--not peace with surrender, but peace with honor--not just an interlude between wars, but a time of lasting friendship and cooperation among all peoples, a time when mankind can unite in a new alliance against our common enemies--poverty, misery, and disease."", ""The recent breakthrough toward a negotiated settlement in Vietnam points to that kind of peace. So does the new relationship which the United States has begun to develop with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. But there is much more to do-the further limitation of nuclear arms, the easing of tensions in Europe, the healing of tragic divisions in the Middle East, the continued strengthening of our alliances, the forging of new trade patterns and the continued development of our volunteer armed forces, which will be the indispensable linchpin of America's peace forces in the years ahead."", 'Peace, more than anything else, can enrich the lives of the children of the seventies. It is for their sake that we have worked so hard to give peace a chance and for their sake we must continue to do so.', 'Some of these new children will be girls, some will be boys. Some will be white, some black, some brown. Will discrimination and quotas limit their horizons? Let us resolve that they will not. As our second goal for the next 4 years, let us seek a more just America--an America in which every human being, regardless of race or religion, age or sex, wealth or national origin, enjoys equal rights before the law and unlimited opportunities for realizing his or her fullest potential.', 'Will the new children enjoy sound health, adequate nourishment, good medical care? Or will they have to contend with the hazards of a society where infant mortality is still higher than in numerous other countries of the world, and where cancer still strikes one American in four sometime during his lifetime?', 'Let us make our third goal a healthy America, where all our people enjoy steadily better health and increasing longevity, where hunger is unknown, and where deadly diseases and drug abuse are rapidly diminishing.', 'Through our plan for a comprehensive health program, our accelerated food assistance programs, our conquest-of-cancer efforts, and our total war against dangerous drugs, your Government today is committed to that kind of America for 1976.', ""Soon tomorrow's children will be ready to start school. Will their parents select the schools they attend? Will tax pressures force them, all of them, into public classrooms regardless of their preferences?"", 'Let us assure each child, as the fourth part of his birthright, the chance to go to school in a well-educated America-in an educational system that calls each of us to excellence in all that we do, that brings the light of learning and the pride of useful skills to all who desire them, that preserves neighborhood schools and educational diversity, and that nurtures a new world renaissance in science, the arts, the humanities.', 'What about the homes in which these children grow up? Will their living standard be high? What about the careers which await them? What about the retirement years at the end of those careers?', ""Point five of the American birthright must be a secure and a prosperous America, where there are jobs for all who can work, a decent income with dignity for those who cannot work; where every dollar earned will buy a dollar's worth; where prudent government spending works for the people, with a fair tax system which does not force the people to work more for the government than they work for themselves."", 'We owe our children something better than steadily rising prices and ever-higher taxes to support welfare handouts. We owe them the kind of solid prosperity America has not had since the Eisenhower years of 1955 and 1956--when we had full employment without inflation and without war. We owe them a reform of the welfare system so that it will not be more profitable to go on welfare than to go to work. We must continue the progress of the last several years and reach those goals.', ""What about the quality of life in the cities and towns where tomorrow's children will live? What about the green earth around them?"", 'Let us make the sixth article of their birthright a livable America--a nation whose urban and rural communities are growing in quality, order, and grace, a nation whose natural environment is restored and protected, with cleaner air and water, more parks and open spaces, wiser use of limited natural resources.', ""The 1970's have been called America's environmental decade. Through the mobilization of citizen concern and the massive support of government at every level, we are meeting that challenge. We are fighting the degradation of man's surroundings everywhere, from the inner city slum to the mountain wilderness, and we are in this fight to win."", ""Our seventh goal for the birthright of tomorrow's children must be an America free from fear, a country where the rule of law is supreme and the rate of crime is declining, where violence is replaced by peaceful change, where civility quiets the angry voices and where decency drives out moral decay. Here, too, we are making good progress, but we must do even better."", ""The last three articles of this birthright as we enter America's third century must deal with the conditions necessary for achieving all the other goals."", ""Our eighth goal must be a free and self-governed America, an America whose unique system of representative government-Federal, State, and local--is a better instrument of the people's will, a better servant of the people's needs, a better protector of the people's liberties in 1976 than at any time since the birth of our country in 1776."", 'To reach this high standard, sweeping reform will be needed, on the scale of a new peaceful American revolution. The sharing of the Federal revenue with our cities and States, which will begin less than 4 weeks from today, marks the first great step in starting the flow of power from Washington back to the people, where it belongs. We must keep the power flowing that way during the years ahead.', 'It was the genius of the people, not the mechanisms of government, that built America. That is why our ninth goal for 1976 must be a pluralist, open America, where government does not dominate, but liberates the individual, opening the way for a new surge of vitality, creative service, and civic responsibility on the part of private enterprise, voluntary institutions, and individual people across this land.', ""The tenth and last part of this American birthright, the most important aspect of all, is our children's right to be born into a great and a good America--a land where people's daily lives are guided by deep moral and spiritual principles, where families are close and strong, where patriotism flourishes without apology, where shared ideals forge unity out of diversity, and where the character of each individual and of the Nation as a whole measures up to the high hopes and the dreams which all mankind invests in America."", 'As your President during these past 4 years, I have visited every one of the 50 States, every region of the country, hundreds of American cities and towns, large and small. I know firsthand that the character of the American people measures up to the hopes of the world.', 'We can be proud that this land of ours is a great and a good country.', 'We can be proud of a democratic system in which the motive is not to grab for the spoils of victory, but to pass along a precious birthright to the generations who will come after us.', 'The choice of policies, of principles, and of candidates in this election is clear-cut and momentous. I think the people understand what is at stake. I have confidence in their ability to make a wise decision. And whatever that decision is on Tuesday, I intend to support our elected leaders as I always have done, I intend to stand up for national unity as I have always done, because America is bigger than any one man or any one party.', 'In the midst of all the commotion of the final weekend before an election, I think it is vitally important to remind ourselves of the great American consensus which will continue to unite us next Wednesday morning, far more powerfully than any vote tallies might seem to divide us.', 'Carl Schurz, a German immigrant, who became a great American statesman, said 100 years ago: ""Ideals are like stars; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands. But like the seafaring man on the desert of waters, you choose them as your guides, and following them you will reach your destiny.""', ""The 10 birthright goals which I have outlined today embrace our Nation's timeless ideals. Let all Americans, of every party and political persuasion, take them as our guides on election day and every day throughout the next 4 years."", ""If we do this, then I believe that this election of 1972 will be remembered as one of America's finest hours, and that the next 4 years will be the 4 best years in America's first two centuries."", 'Thank you and good afternoon.']",1

By your vote, you can make sure that this great decision is made by a majority of Americans eligible to vote, and not simply left to the minority who bother to vote.', 'I am not going to insult your intelligence tonight or impose upon your time by rehashing all the issues of the campaign or making any last-minute charges against our opponents.', 'You know what the issues are. You know that this is a choice which is probably the clearest choice between the candidates for President ever presented to the American people in this century.', 'I would, however, urge you to have in mind tomorrow one overriding issue, and that is the issue of peace--peace in Vietnam and peace in the world at large for a generation to come.', 'As you know, we have made a breakthrough in the negotiations which will lead to peace in Vietnam. We have agreed on the major principles that I laid down in my speech to the Nation of May 8. We have agreed that there will be a cease-fire, we have agreed that our prisoners of war will be returned and that the missing in action will be accounted for, and we have agreed that the people of South Vietnam shall have the right to determine their own future without having a Communist government or a coalition government imposed upon them against their will.', 'There are still some details that I am insisting be worked out and nailed down because I want this not to be a temporary peace. I want, and I know you want, it to be a lasting peace. But I can say to you with complete confidence tonight that we will soon reach agreement on all the issues and bring this long and difficult war to an end.', 'You can help achieve that goal. By your votes, you can send a message to those with whom we are negotiating, and to the leaders of the world, that you back the President of the United States in his insistence that we in the United States seek peace with honor and never peace with surrender.', ""I will not go into the other issues tonight, except to say that as we move to peace, we will open doors to progress on many fronts here at home. It means that we can have something we haven't had since President Eisenhower was President 15 years ago--prosperity without war and without inflation."", 'It means we can have progress toward better education, better health--in all the areas that I have presented to the American people over these past 4 years.', 'It means that we can move toward a goal that every American wants: that is, opportunity for each person in this great and good land to go to the top in whatever particular activity he chooses regardless of his background.', 'Those, then, are the issues you will have in mind.', ""Let me say, finally, I want to thank you for the honor of serving as President for the past 4 years, and, regardless of your decision tomorrow, I can assure you that I shall continue to work for a goal that every American has: Let's make the next 4 years the best 4 years in America's history."", 'Thank you. Good evening.']",1
10,Richard Nixon ,"November 07, 1972","['Good evening my fellow Americans:', 'Before going over to the Shoreham Hotel to address the victory celebration which is in process there, I wanted to take a moment to say a word to all of you in this very personal way, speaking from the Oval Office.', 'I first want to express my deep appreciation to every one of you, the millions of you who gave me your support in the election today, and I want to express my respect for millions of others who gave their support to Senator McGovern. I know that after a campaign, when one loses, he can feel very, very low, and his supporters as well may feel that way. And when he wins, as you will note when I get over to the Shoreham, people are feeling very much better.', 'The important thing in our process, however, is to play the game, and in the great game of life, and particularly the game of politics, what is important is that on either side more Americans voted this year than ever before, and the fact that you won or you lost must not keep you from keeping in the great game of politics in the years ahead, because the better competition we have between the two parties, between the two men running for office, whatever office that may be, means that we get the better people and the better programs for our country.', ""Now that the election is over, it is time to get on with the great tasks that lie before us. I have tried to conduct myself in this campaign in a way that would not divide our country, not divide it regionally or by parties or in any other way, because I very firmly believe that what unites America today is infinitely more important than those things which divide us. We are united Americans--North, East, West, and South, both parties--in our desire for peace, peace with honor, the kind of a peace that will last, and we are moving swiftly toward that great goal, not just in Vietnam, but a new era of peace in which the old relationships between the two super powers, the Soviet Union and the United States, and between the world's most populous nation, the People's Republic of China, and the United States, are changed so that we are on the eve of what could be the greatest generation of peace, true peace for the whole world, that man has ever known."", 'This is a great goal, bigger than whether we are Democrats or Republicans, and it is one that I think you will want to work with me, with all of us, in helping to achieve.', 'There are other goals that go with that--the prosperity without war and without inflation that we have all wanted and that we now can have, and the progress for all Americans, the kind of progress so that we can say to any young American, whatever his background, that he or she in this great country has an equal chance to go to the top in whatever field he or she may choose.', 'I have noted, in listening to the returns a few minutes ago, that several commentators have reflected on the fact that this may be one of the great political victories of all time. In terms of votes that may be true, but in terms of what a victory really is, a huge landslide margin means nothing at all unless it is a victory for America. It will be a victory for America only if, in these next 4 years, we, all of us, can work together to achieve our common great goals of peace at home and peace for all nations in the world, and for that new progress and prosperity which all Americans deserve.', 'I would only hope that in these next 4 years we can so conduct ourselves in this country, and so meet our responsibilities in the world in building peace in the world, that years from now people will look back to the generation of the 1970\'s, at how we have conducted ourselves, and they will say, ""God bless America.""', 'Thank you very much.']",1
11,Richard Nixon ,"November 08, 1972","['Mr. Vice President, Mrs. Agnew, all of our very distinguished guests here at the Shoreham Hotel, and the very distinguished audience listening on television and radio:', 'At Ontario, California, on Saturday night, at the conclusion of a speech to what was estimated as a crowd of 50,000, I said, ""This is the last time I will ever be addressing a campaign rally as a candidate."" It may be that that was the last campaign rally as a candidate, but this means tonight we still have a rally right here.', 'Now, let me briefly touch upon several significant things about this election. First--and this for me is rather unusual-I have never known a national election when I would be able to go to bed earlier than tonight.', 'Second, I want to say here to this great audience and to all of those who will be listening on television and radio, that I know from having been a candidate for Vice President, and a Vice President for 8 years, that this is always a team campaigning for office.', 'I want you to know that during the period of the last several weeks since the convention when I have had to be in Washington, for reasons that all of you could well understand, that I watched the Vice President as he carried the major burden of campaigning.', 'I watched with no concern, and considerable amusement, the attempts that were being made by some rather vicious heckling to get under his skin and get him to blow his cool. Let me say, the real test of a campaigner is to go through the fire of a campaign when he is taking all the heat. The Vice President has proved he is a great campaigner. I was going to say he can take it and be can dish it out, too.', 'I also would like to pay tribute to all of the other members of the team. I refer of course to our campaign chairman, Clark MacGregor, to John Mitchell, his predecessor, to Maurice Stans, our finance chairman, to all of the members of the Cabinet team who did such a magnificent job traveling through this country, to Representatives from the Congress, the House, the Senate, and the national Administration, who carried the story that we wanted to tell throughout the land. They were a great team.', 'I think they have been a great team over the past 4 years, and in this campaign, when you add up those States to what has been called a rather significant victory, they get a great deal of the credit, I can assure you.', 'I also want to pay tribute to another group that too often is overlooked. I wrote a book after the election defeat of 1960, and one of the chapters of that book dealt with the campaign of 1960. When you write a book, you are supposed to dedicate it to somebody, and, not being an expert at this sort of thing, I just put on the flyleaf of the dedication page in this book about the campaign of 1960--I dedicated it, ""To Pat. She also ran.""', 'I want all of you to know tonight how very grateful we should be to the wives of our Cabinet members, to the distaff members, as sometimes--I guess, we can still call them that in these days when you have to be very careful about how you describe people--but in any event, at least shall we say to our First Ladies, and they are always our First Ladies in our own families. I am simply very, very proud of all of them.', 'I can summarize how I feel about all of our campaign in this way: Our speakers throughout campaigned hard. Our speakers throughout campaigned clean. They campaigned on the issues. I am proud of the campaign they have put on, and it showed in the results.', 'Something else was new in this campaign. All of us know, of course, about those young voters. I recall at the convention that we were told by some of the enthusiasts there at our convention that the predictions were wrong that because of the overwhelming youth vote that was going to go against us that we had a very, very hard row to hoe if we were to win this election.', 'Let me say, based on the results I have seen today, we have accomplished what was thought to be the impossible. We not only won a majority of the votes of America, but we won a majority of the votes of young Americans.', 'All of you should know that one who stands in this position with 4 years ahead must think of what he wants for those 4 years. We want, of course, many things. We want to do the very best job we can for all the country, for all people in our society. We want to have in mind, too, the fact that in this election it was very unusual in another respect. It was not region against region. It was not one age group against another age group. It was not party against party. I think we can be proud of the fact that as we look at our majority, which is a very large majority, it comes from all of America.', 'Let us remember that in these next 4 years we are not going to work for one group against another. We are dedicated to work for all Americans to make this a greater country.', 'To those millions of Democrats and independents who supported us as well as, of course, to the Republicans who supported us in overwhelming numbers, they have, you have, our deep appreciation. To all those who worked so hard-our appreciation. I will never be able to thank all of you personally, not even get all the letters out that I would like. But I know what you did and I know how much you contributed.', 'I would simply like to leave one final thought with you, perhaps in a personal sense. No one knows before the votes are counted how it is going to come out. No one really would have predicted after our convention that we were going to win this kind of a victory. Now, at the present time I noticed some of the commentators are referring to the fact that it may be the greatest victory in American political history. Let me tell you, I have two reactions to that. Of course, it is great on election night to think that we have won a victory, but this will be a great victory depending upon what we do with it. In other words, we win elections not simply for the purpose of beating the other party or the other person, but to get the opportunity to do good things for our country. The next 4 years will be the time that we will try to make ourselves worthy of this victory.', 'I will simply say in that connection, it was a great victory but the greater the victory, the greater the responsibility, the greater the opportunity. We are going to try to meet it, dedicating ourselves to those great goals that I have discussed at such great length throughout this campaign and will in the next 4 years--building that world of peace, of real peace with honor throughout the world, and building at home, not only peace at home but the new prosperity and the progress for all Americans that is so close to our hearts.', 'Finally, on that personal note, about 30 days ago, when I was sitting in the Lincoln Sitting Room late at night trying to get some materials ready for a National Security Council meeting the next morning, Tricia dropped into the room around 10:30 or 11:00. She was going out to dedicate a dam or something at a nonpolitical affair. She was trying to get some suggestions about remarks. I find that whenever I make suggestions of remarks to Tricia or Julie or Eddie Cox they always can do better without any suggestions, but I made a couple. Then, before she left the room, she turned and said, ""You know, Daddy, did you ever stop to think that this is your last campaign?"" I said, ""Yes, I have.""', 'As I think of what she said that night, I simply want to say from the bottom of my heart, thanks for making our last campaign the very best one of all.Thank you.']",1
