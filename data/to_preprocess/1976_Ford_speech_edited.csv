0,Gerald R. Ford ,"November 01, 1976","['We are nearly at the end of a long campaign. As I have moved about our country during the past few weeks, many people have told me, ""Mr. President, we know where you stand on jobs, and we think you are right. We know where you stand on inflation, and we agree with you. We know where you stand on foreign policy, and we agree with you there, too. But we are not quite sure what it all adds up to. We are not quite clear where you are aiming to lead America.""', 'So today, I want to talk with you about my concerns and my hopes for America as we enter our third century.', 'My vision of America is a nation that is strong and good, a nation that feels the need for constant improvement, a nation whose people care about each other and want to retain their own special sense of identity. Beyond that--a nation in which basic human rights are respected and maintained: the right to speak our minds; the right to choose the men and women who enact and enforce our laws; the right to stand equal before the law, regardless of sex, race, or religion; the right to bargain freely in the economic marketplace; the right to worship as we choose.', ""We have been through a lot in recent years--a war, a recession, runaway inflation, riots, scandals--a collection of troubles that shook America's confidence and left our people exhausted. In the past 2 years, I have done my best to put America back on even keel, to chart a steady course for the future."", ""America has had its heart broken too many times when grand promises went unfulfilled. We have learned through painful experience that when those frustrations cannot be held inside any more, our society explodes in violence and fear. That is why it is so important that those who would lead this country be honest enough to promise only what they know they can deliver, to admit that some problems can't be solved by waving a magic wand, or creating still another government program, or even by changing an administration. The answer lies not in making government bigger, but in making it serve us better in assuming more responsibilities for ourselves."", 'This Nation was not built on comfort, but on sacrifice; not on a maze of government programs, but on the strength and vitality of a free, self-reliant people.', 'We can improve the quality of life in America. We can improve education and health care. We can have comfortable, affordable homes in safe, decent neighborhoods. We can have clean air and water. We can create more parks and recreational facilities. We can care for those who need our help. We can keep America strong and at peace.', ""These are all worthy goals, and the government can help reach them all. But the government can't do everything. If it tries to do too much, it ends up doing nothing very well. If it assumes too much power and control, we will have sown the seeds of our own destruction as a free people. I would never let government grow so big or so strong that it can take away our freedom. I would not allow our people to grow so dependent on government that they would lose the incentive to develop their own creativity, generosity, and initiative. When a government solution is needed, I would make government respond at the level closest to the problem."", 'That is my vision of America: a vision of limited government and unlimited opportunity; a commitment to common sense and common progress.', ""On July 4, we celebrated the first 200 years of America's history. On November 2, with your help, we will begin a new generation of freedom for all Americans.""]",0
1,Gerald R. Ford ,"November 01, 1976","['Gee, it is nice to be back. It is nice to be back in Michigan.', 'Within hours after I received the nomination in Kansas City, I told Betty that I would open this campaign at home. It is the best way that I could say to my friends and the citizens of my home State, thank you. Thank you for all that you have done for me the past 28 years.', 'I said in my acceptance speech, the speech to the American people, it is from your ranks that I come and on your side that I stand. There is no place on the Earth where that statement is more true than among all of you here in Michigan today.', 'I am the first son of Michigan to serve as President of the United States. I am part of this great State, its people, and its belief in America. You first sent me to Congress 28 years ago, and in those 28 years my deep feelings for Michigan have matured into a total loyalty as well as a deep love.', 'I come to you now to seek your support for my election to the highest office in the land. I know you will support me as you always have. May I tell you how important that really is? Someone once said you can tell a lot about a man by the way his family feels about him. Michigan is my family.', 'From the kids--Mike, Jack, Steve, Susan--from Betty and of course from myself, thanks from the bottom of my heart, for your wonderful support, your continued prayers, and your belief in Jerry Ford.', 'Thank you very much.']",0
2,Gerald R. Ford ,"November 01, 1976","['Let me ask you to be very quiet for just a few minutes, because the issues and decisions you make between now and tomorrow when the polls close are very, very crucial for America.', ""First, I want to thank your great Governor, Jim Rhodes, who has been with President Ford from the very beginning. Jim, I can't express deeply enough my gratitude and appreciation for your loyalty. But let me add this one feature. We have on the stage with me today the two greatest Governors in the history of Ohio."", 'But it is great to be in Akron, Canton, Massillon, and Alliance. What an area in the great State of Ohio.', ""I am honored to be on the team in Ohio with Bob Taft. Send him back to Washington for your good and for the country's good. Bob, you have got to win. And then you have your own Congressman in this area. He has done a super job, a fantastic job on your behalf, but a job for America. Send Ralph Regula back to help us."", 'And now let me speak straight from the shoulder. You have a chance to improve the quality of Congress by sending one of your own, Jim Houston, down to the House of Representatives.', ""But it is great to be here with Mayor Ballard, with Mayor Cmich.1 And then I want to thank somebody else who has taken time, along with others of equal prominence. Wayne,2 thank you very, very much. All over the country we have had outstanding people like Wayne participate voluntarily. We have had Peter Graves, Hugh O'Brien, Rod McKuen. We have had quality people who on their own have come out and said it is important for America that President Ford win. Wayne, I thank you very much."", 'Now there is one fellow that came down here along with his beautiful wife, and I want to thank Bill Stanton. Send Bill back to Congress.', 'But I mentioned a moment ago when I was speaking about your great Governor--and I said there were two great Governors on the platform this morning. And now it is my privilege to introduce to you a man who was a judge in Cleveland, a mayor of Cleveland, a Governor of Ohio, and an outstanding United States Senator, Frank Lausche.', ""You know I come from that State up north, but since 1963 I have been in the State of Ohio 56 times. That's not a bad record. I have been down to Canton on three occasions to the Football Hall of Fame, the football center of the United States. I never made it as a participant, but I respect and admire those outstanding men who have given us a great American sport. Congratulations, Jim."", 'With the help of Bob Taft, Ralph Regula, Bill Stanton, they got through the Cuyahoga National Park, the first national park in the history of the State of Ohio, and I was honored and pleased to sign that legislation.', 'As I said a moment ago, this is a crucial election. It will determine the course of events of this country, not only for the next 4 years but maybe, undoubtedly as I see it, the next century, our third century of American history. You know where I stand. I stand for lower taxes, a balanced budget, lower Federal spending, beating inflation, and peace and liberty for the United States of America. And in the last 2 years America has made incredible progress, and we are on our way, and we are going to make more in the next 4 years under Jerry Ford.', 'In Kansas City, I said we would not concede a single vote, we would not concede a single State. We want Ohio, and we are going to win Ohio.', 'And now let me extend a personal invitation from Betty and from me. We would love to have every one of you down to Inauguration Day on January 20, when Jerry Ford and Bob Dole are sworn in as President and Vice President.', 'There are many issues at stake in this election, but let me take two--one that means whether we have peace or a lack of security in this country; the other involves the health of our economy.', 'In the first debate, Mr. Carter said he would anticipate a $60 billion surplus in the Federal Treasury. He said that he would spend that $60 billion for a whole raft of new Federal programs. In that same debate, I said if there is a $60 billion surplus, I want a tax reduction for the American people.', 'President Ford is for the little taxpayer and President Ford is against the big tax spender. I have been firm; I have been consistent. The best tax reform is tax reduction. The middle-income taxpayer in this country--over 50 percent of us--have been shortchanged in the last 10 years by the actions of the Congress, and we are going to change it in the next session.', 'Mr. Carter, in the last 2 or 3 days, in discussing tax reduction, has said: Perhaps we will have a tax reduction--if we have a tax reduction. It is a clear distinction between him and President Ford. I have consistently, firmly, said the American people should and will have a tax reduction so we can stimulate the economy, so we can give you a better chance to spend that hard-earned cash that you deserve in your pocket and not in the Federal Treasury.', 'In January of this year, 1976, I submitted to the Congress a $28 billion tax reduction package. I said in order to do it honestly and conscientiously, the Congress had to go along with a $28 billion restraint in Federal spending. Included in my tax reduction proposal is the kind of tax reduction that is meaningful to the middle-income taxpayer. I recommended that we increase the personal exemption from $750--which it is today--to $1,000.', 'Let me tell you what that means. The other day I went through a plant and I was talking to some working men on a production line. And one of them said, ""President Ford, what does your tax reduction proposal mean to me and my family?"" I said, ""How many children do you have?"" He said, ""I have got three kids."" It turned out that he had himself, a wife, and three children. I said, ""Get out your pencil."" It means that if Congress had acted responsibly, we would have had for that man and millions and millions and millions of other taxpayers the opportunity next April to sit down and figure out in his case that he would have gotten $1,250 more in personal exemption, money that he could have spent for himself and his lovely family.', ""That's our tax proposal--tax reduction. And on January 3, when Congress reconvenes, they are going to have that tax reduction proposal on their desk, and if they don't pass it in 1977, we will send it right back up in 1978. And if that Congress doesn't pass it in 1978, you and I will go out and beat them in the next election in 1978."", 'But, there is another big difference. I am proud to stand before you and say that I am the first President since Dwight D. Eisenhower who can go to the American people to seek their support and say America is at peace. Under our administration--yours and mine--we have the finest Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines, and we are going to keep them number one.', ""Mr. Carter wants to cut the defense budget by $5 to $15 billion. That is too big a gamble for America's security. And I want to pledge to you that in the next 4 years we are going to keep America number one so we can preserve the peace, deter aggression, meet any challenge. That is the kind of defense program I stand for and you stand for and America stands for."", 'On August 9, 1974, I stood in the East Room of the White House and took an oath of office to be your President. I had not sought this high office. Betty held the Bible, and I placed my hand on it and I said afterwards--because America was troubled, we were divided, there was anger, there was division-after having taken the oath of office, I said, ""I know that you have not elected me by your ballots. I ask you that you confirm me with your prayers.""', 'And with the help of your prayers in the last 2 years, we have gone from inflation of over 12 percent to under 6 percent. With your help and support, we have come out of the worst recession in 40 years. With your help, we have restored trust and confidence in the White House, because I can look each and every one of you in the eye and say I have been candid, straightforward.', 'But most of all, I can stand here with pride and say with your help and, yes, your prayers, America is at peace, not a single young American is fighting or dying on any foreign soil today, and we will keep it that way for the next 4 years.', ""But now we come to the crucial 24 hours. How many of you can remember, I'm sure, in either Canton or Akron or Alliance or Massilion that on July 4 you had a wonderful celebration in honor of our 200th birthday? Our forefathers gave us the greatest document for the governing of people in the history of mankind. Our forefathers have given us the kind of a government that is good for freedom and liberty."", ""We celebrated what they gave to us, but now--beginning tomorrow--we have an opportunity not only to read history but to make history. So, we come down to the bottom line. I know America is on the move. America has a new fresh look. We are together. We are united. So tomorrow, when you make that fateful decision, I ask you not only to confirm me with your prayers but I ask you to confirm me with your ballots. I won't let you down."", 'Thank you very much.']",0
3,Gerald R. Ford ,"November 01, 1976","['Thank you very, very much, Governor Jim Rhodes, Mayor Moody.', 'Let me express my deep appreciation to Congressman Sam Devine, Congressman Chalmers Wylie, Congressmen Clarence Brown, John Ashbrook, and Bill Harsha. I want you to make sure you elect them and reelect them for the benefit of Ohio and the United States.', 'But I want also, for the benefit of this great Buckeye State and for the benefit of our great country--you send Bob Taft back to Washington as your next United States Senator.', 'You know this all began right here, right in front of the Capitol, and local and State government is vital, and so I urge you--elect Bill Brown field to the State senate.', 'It is great to be in Columbus, the home of two of my good friends who represent excellence. First, Jack Nicklaus, a great supporter of mine--I thank him for that help and assistance. And then, also, one of my best friends, the kind of a person who represents excellence not only in coaching but excellence in character. He believes in winning, and that is what we are going to do. Thank you very much, Woody Hayes.1', ""You know, I come from that State up north. [Laughter] But since 1963 I have visited the Buckeye State 56 times, and I love you. I had the honor and the great privilege of speaking at a commencement at Ohio State in the fall of 1974--it was a great experience--but I have also come to Columbus and all of the other places. And you know what? Columbus likes to be, along with the great State of Ohio, on the side of a winner. So let's make it a home run, a touchdown tomorrow for the winning team, Jerry Ford and Bob Dole."", 'But there are several other people that I would like to recognize and indicate to them and to all of you my appreciation. First, we have on this platform one of the three greatest Governors in the State of Ohio, John Bricker.', 'And may I say, incidentally, from the appearance here of this great crowd and from the wonderful rally that we had in the Akron, Canton, Alliance, Massilion area earlier this morning, I am going to issue all of you an invitation. Betty and I want all of you to come down to that inauguration on January 20 when Jerry Ford and Bob Dole are sworn in as President and Vice President.', 'Now let me introduce to you, for some remarks, a person well known to you, who was a judge here in the State of Ohio and Cleveland, who was your Governor-and one of the three greatest Governors in the history of Ohio--who was a United States Senator. And now it is my privilege to introduce a close, personal friend whose support I really appreciate--your former Senator, your former Governor, Frank Lausche.', '[At this point, Frank Lausche announced his support of President Ford. The President then resumed speaking.]', ""An endorsement like that from one of Ohio's great, great citizens means a great deal to Jerry Ford, and I promise you, Frank, I won't let you down."", 'As we enter this critical last 24 hours--and this is one of the most critical elections in the history of the united States; it is the election that will set our course for the first 4 years of our third century--I want you to know where I stand. I stand for lower taxes, more jobs, a balanced budget, lower Federal spending, beating inflation, a clean environment, peace and liberty for the United States of America. From your ranks I come, and with you I stand.', 'In the last 2 years our great country, faced with adversity, has made an incredible comeback. When I spoke to you and to the American people in Kansas City, I said I would not concede a single vote, I would not concede a single State.', ""Ohio is going to be on the right side. We are counting on that Buckeye State to be with us tomorrow. With our momentum, let's do it, a home run."", ""I love that enthusiasm and applause, but take just a minute--let's hear a pin drop--because I want to talk about some of these, or at least two of the critical issues where I strongly differ with my opponent."", 'First, taxes. In the first debate my opponent said that we could anticipate a $60 billion surplus in the Federal Treasury. He said in that debate that he would spend that $60 billion for more programs, piling one on top of another. In that debate I said if there is a $60 billion surplus, I think it ought to go for a tax reduction to the middle-income taxpayer.', 'I can stand here and say with good conscience that President Ford stands for the little taxpayer and President Ford is against the big tax spender. Within the last several days Mr. Carter has been pressed. Does he want a tax reduction or not? He says, if, perhaps. President Ford has been on the line, talking straight from the shoulder saying, yes, the middle-income taxpayer has been shortchanged.', ""I recommended to the Congress in January that we ought to have a $28 billion tax reduction along side of a $28 billion restraint on Federal spending-for every tax dollar in reduction, a dollar reduced in the rate of growth of Federal spending. The Congress gave you half a loaf. They didn't go along with my proposal to increase the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000."", 'Now let me tell you what that means. It means that the middle-income taxpayer--50 percent of those that pay our taxes--would get, and let me illustrate it with an incident that happened: I was in a factory the other day, down a production line, and one of the men said to me, ""President Ford, where do you stand on taxes?"" I told him how I wanted to increase the personal exemption. I said, ""How many children do you have?"" He said, ""I have got three."" I said, ""If you have a wife, three children, and yourself, if Congress had acted responsibly, next April when you made out that income tax return, you would have had, under President Ford\'s tax reduction program, $1,250 more in personal exemption for you to spend and not have in the Federal Treasury.""', ""Now Congress didn't do it. But on January 3, when that next Congress convenes--and I want all of this good Ohio delegation back there to help me-I will have on their desk a tax reduction proposal that will include the increase in the personal exemption; it will increase jobs incentive legislation to help industry expand, to modernize. And if that Congress doesn't pass it in 1977, they will have it on their desk in January of 1978, and if they don't give that kind of decent, equitable tax reduction in 1978, I will join every one of you trying to beat them in that election in 1978."", ""But now let's talk about defense. Today the United States, with our Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines--we are number one. And under President Ford we are going to keep them number one. I have recommended appropriations so they will have the best weapons, the best leadership, the best training. That' is the way to keep the peace. And under President Ford, with the strength that we have, we will strengthen our alliances. We will be able to look our adversaries straight in the eye, and they will respect us."", ""But let me say, you make a great contribution in the city of Columbus, because in the recommendations that I made for a strong defense--and that is the way you keep the peace--that we have a B-1 bomber to replace those aging B-52's that are now 20 and 25 years old. If we don't get the B-1 bomber as an instrument of peace, the President in the next 5, the next 10 years, if we continue to rely on the B-52's, will be sending our young combat pilots to protect us in aircraft older than they are, and that is not going to happen under President Ford."", 'I am proud to stand before you and say that I am the first President since Dwight D. Eisenhower who can tell the American people that America is at peace. I am proud of the fact that not a single young American is fighting or dying on any foreign soil today. And we are at peace because the United States is strong. We are not at war because the United States is strong.', 'And let me say, wasn\'t it a great, great celebration on the Fourth of July when America celebrated its 200th birthday? I happened to have the privilege to fly over New York Harbor and see those ""Tall Ships"" coming in, representing many, many countries. And why did they come to the United States? Because they respect America. And we are proud of America, and we will continue to be proud of America.', 'But now as this great campaign comes to a conclusion, I have the feeling that we have reunited as a people. When I became President, people were angry, divided, disillusioned. I will never forget that day in the East Room of the White House when I put my hand on the Bible held by my wife, Betty, and took the oath of office when America was troubled.', 'Yes, we were in trouble. Inflation was over 12 percent. We were still involved in Vietnam. There was a loss of confidence in the White House itself. We were on the brink of the worst recession in 40 years. And after having taken the oath of office to be your President, I said, since you have not elected me by your ballots, I ask you to confirm me with your prayers.', 'With those prayers we put the ship of state on a steady keel. I had a firm, commonsense hand on the tiller, and we have made incredible progress in the last 2 years. We have cut inflation by better than 50 percent. We have added 4 million jobs; we have 88 million people working today, the most in the history of the United States. We are at peace, and we are going to keep the peace.', 'And I can say with pride to all of you and to my former colleagues in the Congress--Bob Taft, Sam Devine, Chalmers Wylie, Clarence Miller, Bud Brown, Bill Harsha, Willis Gradison--that we have restored that confidence in the White House. I have been open, candid, frank.', ""And now, as we come to the final quarter--in fact, the final minutes--of this great campaign, you have a critical decision to make tomorrow. It couldn't have been put better than the way Frank Lausche put it."", 'But let me add, I have been proud to be your President during troubled times. I want the opportunity to build on that firm foundation, to keep America moving.', ""Therefore, I ask when you go to the polls tomorrow that you not only confirm me with your prayers but you also confirm me with your ballots. And I won't let you down.""]",0
4,Gerald R. Ford ,"November 01, 1976","['[Recorded October 30, 1976. Released November 1, 1976]', 'Tomorrow is a very crucial election. But tonight America is strong, America is free, America is on the move. But 2 years ago America was in deep trouble. When I became President, inflation was over 12 percent. We were on the brink of a serious recession, the worst in 40 years. There had been a loss of trust in the White House itself. We were still involved in Vietnam.', 'When I took the oath of office in August of 1974, I said I had not been elected by your ballots, but I asked that you confirm me by your prayers. Those prayers really helped.', 'In the meantime America has turned around. I put the ship of state on an even keel. I held a firm hand on the tiller for a steady course. Today we are doing much, much better. The rate of inflation has been cut by more than 50 percent. The job picture is getting better. We have added 4 million more jobs in the last 18 months. Eighty-eight million people are working today. We have restored confidence and trust in the White House itself, and America is at peace. Not a single young American is fighting or dying on any foreign soil tonight, and I will keep it that way for the next 4 years.', 'We have two major problems: One, to keep America strong, to meet the challenge of any adversary, to strengthen our alliances. And I pledge to you that the United States will remain number one. Our Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines will be the best, as they are today. Some people have wanted to cut the defense budget. That would be a big gamble. I believe that the way to keep the peace is to keep strong, but in order to keep our domestic economy strong, we need additional tax reduction.', ""Last January I told the Congress they should cut your personal taxes. I think the best tax reform is tax reduction. I recommended that your personal exemption be increased from $750 to $1,000. Congress didn't do its job, but on January 3, when Congress comes back, I will have the tax reduction proposal on their desks so that they can give the middle-income taxpayer, who has been shortchanged, the kind of tax reduction that that group in our society so badly needs."", 'But, in addition, we have some other problems. We will do a better job in the next 4 years in making certain that the victims of crime are protected and that the criminal goes to jail. We will do a better job to help our older people, who have earned our respect and our support. We will do a better job in meeting some of the problems of our major metropolitan areas.', 'We have a lot of things to do, but we are in shape to do it now that we are over the hump of the tough last 2 years.', 'So, we come to the final round in this election. I want your prayers, as you gave them to me 2 years ago. But I would hope that you would confirm me this time by your ballots. I promise you, I pledge you, that I will not let you down.', 'Thank you, and good night.']",0

Ford ,"November 01, 1976","['Thank you very, very much, Governor Bill Milliken, Bob Griffin, Congressman Mary Esch, Lieutenant Governor Dammen and, of course, my wonderful wife, who I have just met at the Detroit airport, Betty Ford.', ""Let me take just a minute before saying something about the election. It is just great, of course, to be home in Michigan and to see some of the Michigan football greats--Ron Kramer, Bill Freehan--and Johnny Orr, the great basketball coach. But there are some other people that I would like to express my appreciation to, individuals who in their own business or their own area of talent have contributed significantly to this momentum that we have going. You have, I guess, been introduced to them: Hugh O'Brien, Wayne Rogers, they are great. Of course, when I came off the plane and Betty was at the stairs meeting me, there was the great Chuck Connors, and I thank Chuck, too."", 'But we have had some others who have traveled the length and the breadth of this country, because they believed in what I stood for: Peter Graves--you have known him from ""Mission: Impossible""--and then one of those fabulous people on television, also from sports, Joe Garagiola. He has been fighting for Jerry Ford for the last 10 days. Thank you.', ""I want to say two things to you: You are going to lose a great Congressman in Marv Esch, but he is going to be a great Senator, and you send him back to Washington, D.C. But you can't leave a void. You have got to have a good replacement, and I hope and trust that you will send Chuck Pursell to replace him."", ""I can't express deeply enough--I hope you will be quiet enough to hear a pin drop--between now and 8 o'clock tomorrow night, when the polls close in Michigan, you and millions like you in the great State of Michigan are going to help make a basic decision that could well turn the tide as to where this country goes in the next 4 years. And, yes, it could be a decision that would affect the next 100 years."", 'So, I ask you to listen to where I stand: I stand for lower taxes. I stand for more jobs. I stand for a balanced budget. I stand for less Federal spending. I stand for winning the battle against inflation. I stand for a clean environment. I stand for less crime. I stand for peace and liberty all over the world, and that is where we are today.', 'Let me phrase it this way: From your ranks I come, and with you I stand-and will--for the next 4 years.', ""In the last 2 years America has made incredible progress. In Kansas City I told the American people I would not concede a single vote, I would not concede a single State. I don't intend to concede Michigan. We are going to win it in Michigan."", 'And now, listen carefully. You may miss something. On the way over here from the airport, Betty and I had a little conference. We decided that all of you wonderful people had our personal invitation to come to the inauguration of Jerry Ford and Bob Dole on January 20.', 'There are many, many issues that I could discuss, but let me take just two. In the first debate my opponent said there would be a $60 billion surplus in the Federal Treasury. He made a commitment. He said if we have a $60 billion surplus, we are going to spend it on program after program after program. That is his point of view. You know what I said in that first debate? I said if there is a $60 billion surplus, I am going to give it back to the American people in a tax reduction.', 'On taxes--I believe the best tax reform is tax reduction. The middle-income taxpayer in America has been shortchanged, and we are going to change it in the next Congress. Jerry Ford is for the little taxpayer, and he is opposed to the big tax spender. On taxes--the last couple of days my opponent has said perhaps we can have a tax reduction. My opponent has said if, if, if, if we can have a tax reduction.', 'I will tell you where I stand. I have been consistent. I have been firm. The American people, the middle-class people, the middle-class taxpayers need tax relief, and they are going to get it under Jerry Ford. As a matter of fact--again, listen now, listen, because this affects you--last January, as Bob Griffin, Marv Esch, and all the other fine Members of Congress know, I recommended to the Congress that the Congress, in order to give equity and fairness to the middle-income taxpayer, we should increase the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000.', 'The other day I was walking through a plant, talking to people on the production line, and one of the men said, ""President Ford, what will you do for me and my family?"" I said, ""Well, how many kids you got?"" He said three. I said, ""You got a wife?"" He said, ""Sure, and I love her."" Then I said, ""All right."" I said, ""If the Congress had been responsible in the last session and done what I recommended they do, you, next April, when you made out that income tax return, could have taken $1,250 more in personal exemption, and you could have spent it instead of having some bureaucrat spend it out of Washington, D.C.""', ""Listen to this--you are a great audience, I love you--when Congress reconvenes next January 3, I am going to have that tax reduction proposal on their desk. Now, if they don't pass it in 1977, we will have it on their desk in 1978. But if they don't pass it in 1978, you and I are going to go out and beat them in the 1978 election."", ""Let's talk about one other big issue. I am the first President--and I am proud to say it--who can stand before the American people since Dwight D. Eisenhower and say America is at peace. But we are at peace in America because America is strong. Our Army, our Navy, our Air Force, our Marines are number one, and we are going to keep them number one."", ""Now, my opponent, he wants to cut the defense budget by $5 billion or maybe $15 billion. Let me tell you, that is too big a gamble for the security of the United States, and President Ford won't take that gamble. One of the greatest accomplishments of this administration is that because we are strong, strong internally and strong externally, there is not a single young American fighting or dying on any foreign soil tonight, and we are going to keep it that way."", 'On August 9, 1974, I stood in the East Room of the White House and took the oath of office. Betty held the Bible. After that was over and as I \'realized the troubled times we were in--with inflation over 12 percent, with America still involved in Vietnam, with us on the brink of the worst recession in 40 years, and trust and confidence in the White House gone--I made a few remarks to the American people. I said, among other things, ""I know that you have not confirmed me by your ballots, but I ask you to confirm me by your prayers.""', 'In those 2 tough years since August 9, we have made incredible progress in this great country. Reflect for a minute on our 200th birthday. It was a great occasion, where all over America we found that there was a new togetherness. We could disagree without being disagreeable. We could move forward as we have, shoulder to shoulder and arm in arm. That spirit is infectious, and America is on the move. I thought then--as I did on August 9--how wonderful the people of Michigan have been to give me the chance to serve not only Michigan but to serve the people of 50 States. Everything I have in politics comes from you, and I express my deepest appreciation and gratitude.', 'But now we have that crucial decision to make. America is respected. Some of you may have seen those ""Tall Ships"" in the harbor of New York. Ship after ship, from country after country, had come to pay respect to the greatest country in the history of mankind, the United States of America.', 'Now, between right this minute and 8 tomorrow night, you have that critical decision to make. Tomorrow, yes, you can confirm me by your prayers--and your prayers truly help--but now you have the opportunity to confirm me with your ballots. I ask for your support, and I promise you from the bottom of my heart I will not let you down.', 'Thank you very much.']",0
6,Gerald R. Ford ,"November 01, 1976","['Would you please be very quiet for just a minute? I would hope that we might even hear a pin drop.', ""I don't think that I can adequately express in words tonight Betty's appreciation and mine for this tremendous welcome to the home that we love so much, Grand Rapids."", 'I have made a lot of speeches, and this is the hardest one to make, because as I look out in this audience and as I saw so many people as we came down Monroe Avenue--Democrats, Independents, Republicans--people that Betty and I lived with, that Betty and I love, that I tried to help over the years when I had the honor of representing this great congressional district, I could tell you some stories about how the tough problems came to our office. And we never asked the person that walked in that office whether he or she was a Democrat or a Republican. We said, what can we do to help you, and that is the way I want to be your President.', 'You know, those wonderful experiences over a period of time, of taking that trailer down through Ottawa County, Ionia County, Kent County, and sitting and listening to wonderful people who had a problem, who wanted to give me a little trouble, give me a hard time--and they did--but also we had a couple of friends that might come in and say nice things about us. But the wonderful experience of representing the Fifth Congressional District will be something that I will never forget, and I thank you for the opportunity.', 'You know, I had a speech I was going to make, but I threw it away. [Laughter]', 'But I have got a couple of friends that I would like to introduce to you and to suggest that you can help me if you help them. First, I would like to recommend, because I know him, because I know the job he has done in Congress, I would like to recommend to you that you vote tomorrow for Mary Esch for the United States Senate. Then I would equally say it would be very helpful to me as your next President if you would send Hal Sawyer to represent you here in the Fifth District.', 'As we came off the expressway, we went down College Avenue and Betty said, ""I went to Fountain School."" We went right by it. Then we went by Central High School, but then, you know, I said to her, ""Well, South High, that was a great school, too."" [Laughter]', 'But anyhow, Grand Rapids, Kent County, Ottawa County, Ionia, well, all of them--western Michigan can make the difference and this is what I want you to know and what I think it is all about tomorrow.', 'You know, on August 9, 1974, I was sworn in as your President. You know better than anybody in this country, I never sought the office, but circumstances put me in the position where I stood in the East Room of the White House. Betty held the Bible open; I put my hand on it. I took the oath of office at a tough time, when there had been a great loss of trust in the White House itself. We had high inflation. We were on the brink of a recession. We were still involved in Vietnam. But with some apprehension I walked over to the Oval Office. But before doing so, I said to all Americans, not just to you from here, that you had not elected me by your ballots, but I prayed that you would confirm me with your prayers. And you did.', ""We went through troubled times for the last 2 years. But because you stood with me, because you prayed with me, because you believed in America, because you had strength and faith--and 215 million other Americans--we have turned things around, and we see brighter skies, and we see greater opportunity. We see, as we saw on July 4, when there was a great spirit that was expressed in America, our 200th birthday, all of a sudden, Americans--Democrats, Independents, and Republicans--came to the conclusion that we not only could read history--and it was a great history--but more importantly, together, regardless of our political persuasion, we could write history for the third century of America's great history, and we will."", ""It is so nice to be back here where I see Bill Milliken, I see Bob Griffin, I see Bob VanderLaan,1 I see all the people that I grew up with, that Betty grew up with. You know, it is hard to express one's deep sentiments about a community and an area that has been so good to us."", 'So, as I conclude these totally prepared remarks--[laughter]--tomorrow each and every one of you have a great decision to make. I suspect it might be the right one.', 'Let me conclude with just this final comment: Betty and I have been honored to represent this part of the country--but all America--in the White House during the last 2 years, and they have been troubled, and they have been tough. But we kept the ship of state on the right course, and I tried to keep a firm, commonsense hand at the tiller. And the net result is, things have turned around. America has made incredible progress in the last 2 years. But we are just moving. We are going to get better. We are going to make America what our forefathers said it would be.', ""When I was sworn in, I asked for your prayers. I said you hadn't elected me. But tomorrow all of you in this great area of western Michigan can really decide the election. You can decide the election in Michigan."", ""In Kansas City I said I wouldn't concede a single vote, I wouldn't concede a single State--and I don't concede Michigan to the opposition. Western Michigan can turn the tide. Western Michigan can decide the fate of the next 4 years in this country. It will make the difference in Michigan. It will make the difference in the election."", ""And so, I say to you calmly, from the depth of my appreciation: Tomorrow, yes, I want your prayers for confirmation, but tomorrow I ask that you confirm me with your votes, and I won't let you down. I promise that."", 'Thank you.']",0
7,Gerald R. Ford ,"November 02, 1976","[""In these last hours I'd like to share with you some personal thoughts about today's election. To all of us, the outcome is important, because the choice is final."", ""I believe I offer experienced leadership; you will have to decide whether my opponent can make the same claim. I think my approach could properly be called steady and dependable; it is my opinion that, even as I speak to you, his claims are unclear and untested. To single out just one issue, my course promises a lid on spending and a tax cut for every American family; Mr. Carter's approach shifts with the wind, leaving me with the feeling that we, the American people, could be left high and dry."", 'To stay on our steady and dependable course, I need your help; I need your vote. To me it is more than a choice between different approaches to government; it is the test of our political system, a test of the qualities we Americans seek in our leadership.', ""For these past 2 years I have been careful never to promise what I could not deliver. It has been my goal to inspire your confidence in America through solid performance rather than through mere words. And in these past 2 years I think America has come a long way back: We're at peace in our world, we have peace of mind here at home, inflation has been cut in half, we've set a peacetime record of 4 million new jobs in 17 months, and honor has been restored to the White House. I'm proud of that extraordinary comeback, and I think America should be too. You all did it. And I think we can be proud."", 'So now that our comeback has brought us to the threshold of a better quality of life, the choice is yours to make. I hope you will choose continued leadership. This is my fondest hope: to continue to serve the people of this country that has blessed me in so many ways.', 'The White House has affected every person ever to serve in it. Many have added to its wisdom. Some have succumbed to its power. Most have risen to its challenge. In my own case perhaps it is the unique conditions of my service that have most influenced my thoughts. Perhaps only one who came to the Presidency without being elected can care as deeply as I do to use that power without ever abusing your trust. Perhaps only one who has served as your President without your mandate can desire as strongly as I do to serve as your President with your mandate.', 'This election comes at the end of our second century and also at the beginning of what can be a new generation of freedom where individual Americans can know the blessings of freedom without the intrusions of a government trying to be all things to all people.']",0

But I did want Betty, Mike, Jack, Steve, Susan, and Gayle to come down with me and to listen while Betty read a statement that I have sent to Governor Carter. I guess Ron1 has told you that I called him."", 'But I do want to express on a personal basis my appreciation and that of my family for the friendship that all of us have had. And after Betty reads the statement that was sent to Governor Carter by me, I think all of us--Betty, the children, and myself--would like to just come down and shake hands and express our appreciation personally.', 'Let me call on the real spokesman for the family. Betty.', 'Mrs. Ford. The President asked me to tell you that he telephoned President elect Carter a short time ago and congratulated him on his victory.', ""The President also wants to thank all those thousands of people who worked so hard on his behalf and the millions who supported him with their votes.
