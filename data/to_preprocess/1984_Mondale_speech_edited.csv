0,Walter F. Mondale ,"February 21, 1983","['Today I declare my candidacy for President of the United States.', 'I do so with thanks to the people of Minnesota. Because of you, for twenty years I have been privileged to serve in this Capitol, in the United States Senate, and in the second highest office in the land. Today I ask your help again.', ""In the small communities of southern Minnesota where I grew up, we believed in some old American value's that don't need any updating."", 'When I look back on all the troubles my parents had losing the farm, the Depression, sickness--what strikes me is how our beliefs pulled us through. My dad was a minister. And my mother filled our home and our church with love and music.', 'We were rural people: we knew that hard work was the only way to make it. And we knew, as O. E. Rolvaag put it, ""No matter where we\'ve come from, we all have the same job--to push together for the goal that mankind has been seeking ever since it was the first day ""We\'re here to build for a greater justice among men and women.""', ""That's what Minnesota is all about."", 'Our country, too, is built on community. We depend on one another--children on parents; cities on farmers; civilians on soldiers; seniors on workers; citizens on public servants; the sick, the handicapped, and the unemployed on us all.', ""With these values, we've accomplished miracles. Each new challenge--rebuilding Europe, conquering space, defeating hunger--we've met"", 'But now we in this generation must meet our own challenges.', ""A generation ago, this country stocked the shelves of the world. Now it's hard to find a basic American industry in shape for the future."", 'Once we were building the most ambitious highway system on earth. Now our economy is dodging potholes.', 'Once our scientists were sending us to the moon. Now there are fewer physics teachers than school districts.', 'Once this abundant country was nearly self-sufficient. Now our energy supply depends too much on a foreign cartel.', 'Once we were rich, and our allies were poor. Now they are strong, too, and to lead them, we must persuade them.', 'Once the nuclear age was dominated by us. Now the arms race threatens the fate of the earth.', 'We know we can\'t solve our own problems by repeating our parents\' answers. As John Gardner once said, ""A nation is never finished. You can\'t build it and then leave it standing like the pharoahs did the pyramids. It has to be built and rebuilt. It has to be re-created in each generation by believing, caring men and women. It is our turn now. If we don\'t believe or don\'t care, nothing can save the nation. If we believe and care, nothing can stop us.', ""Nothing will stop us. Because the future is made for America--Name an advantage that the future requires, and you'll see an asset we already have."", 'In the years ahead, everything will depend on economic growth: our jobs, our defense, our fight for social justice.', 'To get our economy growing again will take people--the skills, discoveries, creativity, and the spirit of all Americans.', 'We must become an America where children master basic skills again; whose parents are partners with schools again; whose teachers are rewarded and raise standards again; whose students get the financial aid they need again; whose graduates have tools for a lifetime of learning; whose employers invest in a lifetime of training; and whose educators steer this generation toward excellence.', 'We must become an America where students speak the language of science; whose engineers invent the future; where the arts and humanities enrich our spirit; where libraries and laboratories are the best in the world; and where scientists train the next generation of genius.', 'We must have an America whose schools teach the languages of the globe; whose colleges teach the cultures of the world; whose diplomats speak the languages of their hosts; whose exporters speak the languages of their markets; and whose fluency launches a new generation of growth.', 'Next, the future will require international competitiveness. And our nation has the capacity to compete again.', 'The heart of competitiveness must be a strong new national policy to strengthen entrepreneurship, small business, and free enterprise.', 'We must have an America where entrepreneurs have the capital to get going; inventors have the risk-takers to back them; businesses have the talent to staff them; products have the foreign markets they need; and capitalists create a new generation of jobs.', 'I offer a Presidency that promotes exports aggressively, tears down barriers to the sales of our services, and insists that our trading partners open their markets as wide to us as we open ours to them.', 'I propose an era when harbors are being deepened, bridges strengthened, highways repaved, and railroads rebuilt.', 'I propose a nation whose factories are the most efficient in the world; whose merger barons stop shuffling assets, and start modernizing equipment; and whose short-term profits become long-term investments.', 'I propose an America where labor and management put the old bitterness behind them; workers are retrained for the jobs of the future; quality is rising, and absenteeism is falling; and government is a force for restructuring and renewal.', 'Next, I seek the Presidency to restore our global leadership.', 'Our President must understand and bolster all our real advantages: military effectiveness, economic strength, energy independence, moral authority, alliances that no enemy can weaken, and defenses that no nation dare challenge.', 'We must be an America whose social justice at home attracts friendship abroad, and whose voice condemns repression--from the camps of the Russian Gulag to the jails of the Latin generals.', 'We must see the world as it really is--an arena for a competition America can win, where our freedom, our values, and our achievements are a magnet for all the world.', 'Finally, I enter this race not just to seek a victory, but to point toward sanity.', 'Our determination to reduce the nuclear risk must be unquestioned in Europe and around the world again.', 'We must stand by the ABM treaty, resubmit the SALT treaty, and negotiate a comprehensive test ban treaty.', 'We must block the spread of nuclear weapons to new nations, and control exports that can be turned into bomb factories.', 'We must have a President who masters the arms control process, does the hard bargaining with the Soviets, negotiates a mutual and verifiable nuclear freeze, and at long last reverses this mindless, wasteful madness.', ""This is the nation's agenda--and mine. I ask for your mandate to seize the American advantage--to invest in our values, our talent, our competitiveness, our strength, and our survival."", 'No President can do that alone, and so I ask for something more: I ask the American people to give their best.', ""I call for stronger families. There isn't a single problem that can be solved without the values we learn at home: to work hard, tell the truth, obey the law, and cherish our faith."", ""I call for tougher discipline. You can't become a biochemist by osmosis: it takes excellence. You can't deter crime by ignoring it: it takes punishment."", 'I call for cooperation. Everyone must contribute; all must sacrifice.', 'And I call for realism. There is a long haul ahead. Politicians must stop peddling quick fixes, and all of us must remember that education, training, research, enterprise, and all things that count take time.', 'Americans have not lost their knack for greatness. As Barbara Tuchman has written, ""The urge for the best is an element of humankind as inherent as the heartbeat.""', 'But when people do their best, their effort must be rewarded. Today that bargain is not being honored enough.', 'Too many families are suffering the consequences of high deficits--record real interest rates, rising taxes, unemployment, and bankruptcy. All across the nation, our states are being cruelly forced to raise taxes and slash services, weakening our federal system.', ""We must have an America where working people don't have to pay more so that the privileged can pay less. I call on Congress to chop those deficits down, scale the defense budget to reality, repeal the scheduled tax cuts for the wealthy, repeal indexing, and keep our tax system progressive."", 'Too many Americans are losing their trust in government. They expect their President to faithfully execute the laws of the land. Yet they see this Administration cynically undermining and betraying the laws protecting our air, our water, and our land.', 'To earn public trust, our government must be on the side of the vulnerable. We must continue the long American march to broader liberties. Before this decade is over, I want to go to an inauguration where a President swears to ""preserve, protect, and defend"" a Constitution that contains the Equal Rights Amendment.', 'Too many people tell me they feel swept away by the tidal wave of special interest money that is swamping our political system. And I agree.', 'To dramatize the need for change, my campaign will accept no contributions from political action committees. And I will work to slap controls on PACs, clamp ceilings on campaign spending, close the independent committee loopholes and finance Congressional campaigns publicly.', 'Ours must be a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. I say it is time to declare that the government of the United States is not up for sale. It belongs to the American people, and we want it back.', 'If we restore trust, government can act.', 'While government can be a problem, it is not the problem. Human suffering, a faltering economy, a dangerous arms race, a divided America: these are the problems.', 'Today, there are American families sleeping in cars, searching for work, and lasting the grapes of wrath: these are our true problems. I believe in social decency, not social Darwinism.', 'What I am saying is this: If we are to pursue the goals that strengthen our nation, we must have a strong, effective, caring government, worthy of public trust.', ""I know I do not begin this journey alone. I begin it here with you, my friends who started me in public life and who have sustained me over the years. I start it with my wife, Joan, and our children, and my family. You've helped me before; please help me once again."", ""I know we will win. We have a plan for the future. We have everything we need to renew our country. But the American people understand that we also need a President who knows what he's doing."", 'I do--thanks to you. I served as Attorney-General for four years, and I know state government. I served in the United States Senate for twelve years. Thanks to you, and the American people, I was proud to serve under President Carter as Vice President.', ""I have the experience. I know where the talent is. I know the White House. I know how to shape a government. I know how to manage. I know the Congress. I know how to defend this country. I know how to search for peace. I know who our friends are. I'm on to our enemies. I know our people. And I know myself: I am ready. I am ready to be President of the United States."", 'I am ready, and so are the American people.', ""I've travelled this country more than any living American. I know what our people want. They want to get on with it."", ""We've had Vietnam; it's over. We've had Watergate; it's behind us. We've tried quick fixes; they don't work. We want our edge back. Schools must teach again. Americans must work again. Convicted criminals must go to jail again. Our nation must lead the world again."", ""Americans want to get going. They're confident. They're ready. And so am I."", 'Thank you very much.', 'I am ready, and so are the American people.']",0
1,Walter F. Mondale ,"July 12, 1984","[""A year and a half ago, in this chamber, I announced my candidacy for President of the United States. One week from today, I expect to be nominated for President of the United States. And today, I'm delighted to announce that I will ask the Democratic convention to nominate Geraldine Ferraro of New York to run with me for the White House."", ""I know what it takes to be a good Vice President; I was once one myself. I looked for the best Vice President and I found her in Gerry Ferraro. It was a difficult choice at first, but over the last week or so, as I've worked on my acceptance speech, as I prepared our message to the country, the choice became clear. My campaign, my Presidency, will honor basic American values and those who embody them. We must go into the future together as one indivisible community."", 'America is not just for some of us. History speaks to us today. Our Founders said in the Constitution, ""We the people"" - not just the rich, or men, or white, but all of us. Our message is that America is for everyone who works hard and contributes to our blessed country. That\'s what my choice is about and that\'s what Gerry\'s about. The story Of her road from the Ferraro home to this moment is really the story of a classic American dream. She\'s earned her way here today. Like most Americans, she\'s worked hard for everything that she\'s achieved. She has a strong family life, deep religious conviction and working Americans of average income will find in her a Vice President who knows them and who will fight for them.', ""'Excelled in Everything'"", ""She believes in a strong America that sees our adversaries through clear eyes, and an America that uses its strength and its values to keep the peace. Gerry has excelled in everything she's tried, from law school at night to being a tough prosecutor, to winning a difficult election, to winning positions of leadership and respect in the Congress, and to her role as chair of the Democratic platform committee."", ""As I've worked on my acceptance speech, I've been thinking about our platform because it says something about our party, our country's future and about Gerry. That platform breaks with the past but abandons nothing that matters. It strikes the right balance between compassion and practicality. It took a gifted negotiator with an eye on the American people to accomplish that, and Gerry made it look easy."", 'One last point. This is an exciting choice. I want to build a future -- let me say that again: This is an exciting choice! Geraldine Ferraro and I have one vision, one message and two voices to tell it. Tomorrow we begin our campaign together in Elmore Minnesota. From there to the convention, then to the nation, and then to the White House.', 'Thank you very much.', ""Rep. Ferraro's Remarks:"", 'Thank you, Vice President Mondale. Vice President - it has such a nice ring to it. I want to thank Fritz Mondale for asking the convention to nominate me as his running mate. This choice says a lot about him, about where the country has come, and about where we want to lead it.', ""Fritz called my road here the classic American dream. He's right. My father came to America from a little town in Italy called Marcianise. Like millions of other immigrants, he loved our country passionately. But what he loved most about it was that in America, anyting is possible if you work for it. I grew up among working people, straightforward solid Americans trying to make ends meet, trying to bring up their families and leave their country a little bit better off than when they moved here and found it. Those are my values, too."", 'I have a strong, loving family, my husband, John, and Laura, who are here with me today, and Don and John Jr., who will be joining us soon, and our neighborhood and our faith are important parts of our lives. So is our work, in school and business and in the Congress.', ""'Big Stake' for New York"", ""The people of New York, whom I represent, have a big stake in this election; I believe it today just as I have since 1980. As recently as Monday, I visited two senior centers in my district before I ran out to San Francisco. My people told me they were worried about Social Security and they're terrified about what might happen to the Medicare system. I've talked to parents who can't get student loans for their kids, and I know how unemployment has ripped through some of the families in my district. And I know their fears about the future."", ""They love America and support a strong, sensible defense. But they want nothing to do with reckless adventures in Latin America, and they want to get some talks going and stop this nuclear arms race before it destroys us all. My constituents in Queens are not alone; you know people just like them in Minnesota and throughout our country. They're your neighbors, they're your friends. In fact, I think they're you. And they're the people the Democratic Party has always fought for."", ""In this campaign, I'm going to take our case for a better future to those Americans. I've won their support in Queens because they know I'll fight for them, and I'm eager now to win their support throughout the nation."", ""When Fritz Mondale asked me to be his running mate, he sent a powerful signal about the direction he wants to lead our country. American history is about doors being opened, doors of opportunity for everyone no matter who you are, as long as you're willing to earn it. These last few hours, I've got to tell you, I've been on the phone talking with friends and supporters around the country. There's an electricity in the air, an excitement, a sense of new possibilities and of pride."", 'My good friend, Charlie Rangel, the Congressman from Harlem, said to me, ""Gerry, my heart is full."" So is mine. Fritz Mondale knows what America is really about, and I\'m honored to join him in this campaign for the future.', 'Thank you.']",0
2,Walter F. Mondale ,"July 19, 1984","['My fellow Democrats, my fellow Americans:', 'I accept your nomination. Behind us now is the most wide open race in political history.', 'It was noisy - but our voices were heard. It was long - but our stamina was tested. It was hot - but the heat was passion, and not anger. It was a roller coaster - but it made me a better candidate, and it will make me a stronger president of the United States.', 'I do not envy the drowsy harmony of the Republican Party. They squelch debate; we welcome it. They deny differences; we bridge them. The are uniform; we are united. They are a portrait of privilege; we are a mirror of America.', ""Just look at us at here tonight: Black and white, Asian and Hispanic, Native and immigrant, young and old, urban and rural, male and female - from yuppie to lunchpail, from sea to shining sea. We're all here tonight in this convention speaking for America. And when we in this hall speak for America, it is America speaking."", ""When we speak of family, the voice is Mario Cuomo's."", ""When we speak of change, the words are Gary Hart's."", ""When we speak of hope, the fire is Jesse Jackson's."", ""When we speak of caring, the spirit is Ted Kennedy's."", ""When we speak of patriotism, the strength is John Glenn's."", 'When we speak of the future, the message is Geraldine Ferraro.', 'And now we leave San Francisco - together.', 'And over the next hundred days, in every word we say, and every life we touch, we will be fighting for the future of America.', ""Joan and I are parents of three wonderful children who will live much of their lives in the twenty-first century. This election is a referendum on their future - and on ours. So tonight I'd like to speak to the young people of America - and to their parents and to their grandparents."", ""I'm Walter Mondale. You may have heard of me - but you may not really know me. I grew up in the farm towns of southern Minnesota. My dad was a preacher, and my mom was a music teacher. We never had a dime. But we were rich in the values that were important; and I've carried those values with me ever since."", 'They taught me to work hard; to stand on my own; to play by the rules; to tell the truth; to obey the law; to care for others; to love our country; to cherish our faith.', ""My story isn't unique."", ""In the last few weeks, I've deepened my admiration for someone who shares those same values. Her immigrant father loved our country. Her widowed mother sacrificed for her family. And her own career is an American classic: Doing your work. Earning your way. Paying your dues. Rising on merit."", 'My presidency will be about those values. My vice president will be Geraldine Ferraro.', 'Tonight, we open a new door to the future. Mr. Reagan calls it ""tokenism."" We call it America.', ""Ever since I graduated from Elmore High, I've been a Democrat. I was attorney general of my state; then a U.S. senator. Then, an honest, caring man - Jimmy Carter - picked me as his running mate and in 1976 I was elected vice president. And in 1980, Ronald Reagan beat the pants off us."", 'So tonight, I want to say something to those of you across our country who voted for Mr. Reagan - Republicans, Independents, and yes, some Democrats: I heard you. And our party heard you.', ""After we lost we didn't tell the American people that they were wrong. Instead, we began asking you what our mistakes had been. And for four years, I listened to all of the people of our country. I traveled everywhere. It seemed like I had visited every acre of America."", 'It wasn\'t easy. I remember late one night, as I headed from a speech in one city to a hotel a thousand miles away, someone said to me, ""Fritz, I saw you on TV. Are those bags under your eyes natural?"" And I said, ""No, I got them the old-fashioned way. I earned them.""', 'To the thousands of Americans who welcomed me into your homes and into your businesses, your churches and synagogues: I thank you.', ""You confirmed my belief in our country's values. And you helped me learn and grow."", 'So, tonight we come to you with a new realism: Ready for the future, and recapturing the best in our tradition.', 'We know that America must have a strong defense, and a sober view of the Soviets.', 'We know that government must be as well-managed as it is well-meaning.', 'We know that a healthy, growing private economy is the key to the future.', 'We know that Harry Truman spoke the truth when he said: ""A President . . . has to be able to say yes and no, but mostly no.""', 'Look at our platform. There are no defense cuts that weaken our security; no business taxes that weaken our economy; no laundry lists that raid our Treasury.', ""We are wiser, stronger, and focused on the future. If Mr. Reagan wants to re-run the 1980 campaign: Fine. Let them fight over the past. We're fighting for the American future - and that's why we're going to win this campaign."", 'One last word to those who voted for Mr. Reagan.', 'I know what you were saying. But I also know what you were not saying.', 'You did not vote for a $200 billion deficit.', 'You did not vote for an arms race.', 'You did not vote to turn the heavens into a battleground.', 'You did not vote to savage Social Security and Medicare.', 'You did not vote to destroy family farming.', 'You did not vote to trash the civil rights laws.', 'You did not vote to poison the environment.', 'You did not vote to assault the poor, the sick, and the disabled.', 'And you did not vote to pay fifty bucks for a fifty-cent light bulb.', ""Four years ago, many of you voted for Mr. Reagan because he promised you'd be better off. And today, the rich are better off. But working Americans are worse off, and the middle class is standing on a trap door."", ""Lincoln once said that ours is to be a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. What we have today is a government of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich. And we're going to make a change in November. Look at the record."", ""First, there was Mr. Reagan's tax program. What happened was, he gave each of his rich friends enough tax relief to buy a Rolls Royce - and then he asked your family to pay for the hub caps."", 'Then they looked the other way at the rip-offs, soaring utility bills, phone bills, medical bills.', 'Then they crimped our future. They let us be routed in international competition, and now the help-wanted ads are full of listings for executives, and for dishwashers - but not much in between.', 'Then they socked it to workers. They encouraged executives to vote themselves huge bonuses - while using King Kong tactics to make workers take Hong Kong wages.', 'Mr. Reagan believes that the genius of America is in the boardrooms and exclusive country clubs. I believe that the greatness can be found in the men and women who built our nation; do its work; and defend our freedom.', ""If this administration has a plan for a better future, they're keeping it a secret."", 'Here is the truth about the future: We are living on borrowed money and borrowed time. These deficits hike interest rates, clobber exports, stunt investment, kill jobs, undermine growth, cheat our kids, and shrink our future.', ""Whoever is inaugurated in January, the American people will have to pay Mr. Reagan's bills. The budget will be squeezed. Taxes will go up. And anyone who says they won't is not telling the truth to the American people."", 'I mean business. By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two-thirds.', ""Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did."", ""There's another difference. When he raises taxes, it won't be done fairly. He will sock it to average-income families again, and leave his rich friends alone. And I won't stand for it. And neither will you and neither will the American people."", 'To the corporations and freeloaders who play the loopholes or pay no taxes, my message is: Your free ride is over.', ""To the Congress, my message is: We must cut spending and pay as we go. If you don't hold the line, I will: That's what the veto is for."", ""Now that's my plan to cut the deficit. Mr. Reagan is keeping his plan secret until after the election. That's not leadership; that's salesmanship. And I think the American people know the difference."", ""I challenge tonight, I challenge Mr. Reagan to put his plan on the table next to mine - and then let's debate it on national television before the American people. Americans want the truth about the future - not after the election."", ""When the American economy leads the world, the jobs are here, the prosperity is here for our children. But that's not what's happening today. This is the worst trade year in American history. Three million of our best jobs have gone overseas."", 'Mr. Reagan has done nothing about it. They have no plan to get our competitive edge back. But we do. We will cut the deficits, reduce interest rates, make our exports affordable, and make America number one again in the world economy.', 'We will launch a renaissance in education, in science, and learning. A mind is a terrible thing to waste. And this must be the best-educated, best-trained generation in American history. And I will lead our nation forward to the best system that this nation has ever seen. We must do it, we must do it.', ""It is time for America to have a season of excellence. Parents must turn off that television; students must do their homework; teachers must teach; and America compete. We'll be number one if we follow those rules; let's get with it in America again."", ""To big companies that send our jobs overseas, my message is: We need those jobs here at home. And our country won't help your business - unless your business helps our country."", 'To countries that close their markets to us, my message is: We will not be pushed around any more. We will have a president who stands up for American workers and American businesses and American farmers in international trade.', 'When I grew up, and people asked us to imagine the future we were full of dreams. But a few months ago, when I visited a grade school class in Texas and asked the children to imagine the future, they talked to me about nuclear war.', ""As we've neared the election, this administration has begun to talk about a safer world.

And in my first hundred days, I will stop the illegal war in Nicaragua."", 'We know the deep differences with the Soviets. And America condemns their repression of dissidents and Jews; their suppression of Solidarity; their invasion of Afghanistan; their meddling around the world.', ""But the truth is that between us, we have the capacity to destroy the planet.

Why can't they understand the cry of Americans and human beings for sense and sanity in control of these God awful weapons? Why, why?"", ""Why can't we meet in summit conferences with the Soviet Union at least once a year? Why can't we reach agreements to save this earth?

He has won. We are all Americans. He is our President, and we honor him tonight.', 'Again tonight, the American people, in town halls, in homes, in fire houses, in libraries, chose the occupant of the most powerful office on earth. Their choice was made peacefully, with dignity and with majesty, and although I would have rather won, tonight we rejoice in our democracy, we rejoice in the freedom of a wonderful people, and we accept their verdict. I thank the people of America for hearing my case.', ""I have traveled this nation, I believe, more than any living American, and wherever I've gone, the American people have heard me out. They've listened to me. They've treated me fairly. They've lifted my spirits and they've added to my strength, and if there is one thing I'm certain of, it is that this is a magnificent nation, with the finest people on earth."", ""I thank, above all, my family. How lucky I am. Joan has campaigned with class all over this nation. And we're very, very proud of our kids — Ted and Eleanor, Jane and William. Everywhere they went they got us support."", ""And I thank Geraldine Ferraro. We're very proud of Gerry — very proud of Gerry."", ""We didn't win, but we made history, and that fight has just begun. And once again, here I am in Minnesota. In over 24 years, never once have the people of Minnesota turned me down. They voted tonight. Minnesotans, this is a special state — a remarkable state with a special spirit.
