0,            John F. Kerry          ,"August 05, 2004","[""Thank you for that gracious introduction. As you know, right after our convention, John Edwards and I set off on a journey to meet face to face with people all across this country – to share our plan for a stronger America at home, and a more respected America in the world. But more importantly, to listen to what people have to say. And today I'm honored to take a little bit of a detour on our westward journey -- because I want to hear your ideas, your concerns and your hopes for the future."", ""As Americans, we are living in a time transformed by 9/11. Ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan – and repeated increases in threat levels – are constant reminders that our soldiers and our homeland are still in harm's way. As journalists, you are operating in that new world. Yet I also believe enduring principles apply here: We won't win this struggle by hiding or ignoring the facts. You have a part to play – not as partisans, but as truth-tellers. Because the key to victory in the war on terror is not just the power of our arms, but the power of our ideals."", 'The information, the commentary, the debate that you bring to the eyes and ears of America – and the world – are critical to an informed public, critical to making the right decisions, and critical to correcting the wrong ones.', 'We are in this fight because we are a democracy. We must win it as a democracy. And one of the most powerful weapons in the arsenal of our democracy is the freedom of the press.', 'You have another great power and privilege in this decisive time. As Americans prepare to decide the direction of our free society – not just for the next four years, but perhaps for decades to come, you will report and referee the arena of a great national campaign. You know the questions people are asking because you hear them everyday:', 'Who has the right plan to win the war on terror and make America safe? Who has a real plan for a stronger America that will create new good paying jobs? Who has a realistic plan to hold down health care costs – and open up access to health care for all Americans? Who is being straightforward about taxes – about the need to cut taxes for the middle class, and rollback an unaffordable tax cut for individuals who make over $200,000 a year – so we can invest in health care and education, and cut the deficit in half in four years? And, above all, who is truly committed to bridging the divides in this country that continue to separate race from race, group from group, region from region?', 'These are questions that are important to communities of color and to every American. As the motto of Frederick Douglas\' North Star newspaper proclaimed in 1848, ""Right is of no sex--Truth is of no color--God is the Father of us all, and we are all Brethen.""', ""We're really going to unite the country -- we're going to put in place the policies that will bring us together and move America forward."", ""We're being told this week, again and again, that we've turned corner. We're being told to look at the results. I agree. Let's look at the record. Have we turned the corner when forty-four million Americans don't even have basic health care coverage? Have we turned the corner when we've lost nearly 1.8 million private sector jobs? Have we turned the corner when we're told that outsourcing is good for America – and the new jobs that are being created pay $9,000 less than the jobs that have been lost?"", ""My friends, just saying you've turned the corner, doesn't make it so. Slogans don't matter. Results matter. Results are what make the difference in people's lives."", 'We believe America, and all Americans, can do better.', 'Our plans for America embrace all Americans. Of course, I am also all too aware – how could you live in America and not be aware? – of the special challenges facing people of color. Fifty years after Brown v Board of Education, in too many painful ways, America is still a house divided; too many Americans continue to be separate and unequal in health status, educational achievement, and living standards.', ""Despite all the legal gains – and that journey isn't finished yet either – America can't be fully America when millions still face barriers to living up to their God-given potential. How, for example, can we accept a situation where 50% of African American men in New York City are without a job? How can we accept the fact that one of every five Asian Americans attempting to buy or rent a home faces discrimination?"", 'This is unworthy of a nation that values equality, and we have to change it.', 'I believe with all my heart that America can do better and we will. And the best way to lift up those who have been left out is to honor the shared values that unite us and show the true face of America: Faith and family. Hard work and responsibility. Opportunity for all – so that every child, every parent, every worker, has an equal shot at living up to their God-given potential.', ""That is the heart and soul of my plan for a stronger America. The details of that plan were just released in book form earlier this week. The book is detailed and clear. I hope everything about it is straightforward; I know the title is. It's simply called, Our Plan for America. And you can download the entire volume at JohnKerry.com."", ""Now, I am not going to turn this into a John Kerry book reading, but let me highlight just some of what's in the book."", 'Our plan has three basic parts:', ""The first part focuses on our security. It lays out a strategy to strengthen our military, build and lead strong alliances, and reform our intelligence system. It sets out a path to win the peace in Iraq – and to get the terrorists before they get us. To strengthen our homeland security, we will protect our ports, secure our chemical and nuclear power plants, and support our police officers, firefighters and EMT's. You know, color coded warnings aren't enough if we continue to let 95% of container ships come into our ports without ever being physically inspected."", 'The second part of the book focuses on expanding economic opportunity. It offers a real plan to keep and create good paying jobs in America. To end tax breaks that reward companies for shipping American jobs overseas. To revitalize manufacturing – and encourage investment in the new industries of the future.', 'At the same time, we will restore fiscal discipline not only by rolling back the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, but by closing tax loopholes that are nothing more than corporate welfare – and making government live by the same rule that our families do: pay as you go.', ""Third, our plan focuses on strengthening families. John and I don't want working families to just get by. We want them to get ahead. That's why 98 percent of Americans will pay lower taxes under our plan -- with additional tax breaks to help them cover health care, child care, and college."", ""In the past week, our opponents haven't offered a plan of their own, or a defense of their record. Instead, after four long years, all we've been given is a new slogan. In the past week, we've suddenly been told again and again that America has turned the corner. Well, you know, the last president who used that slogan – who told us prosperity was just around the corner was Herbert Hoover during the Great Depression."", ""We've been called pessimists for pointing out the facts, and being honest about the struggles of hard-working families. Here's my answer to that: there is nothing more pessimistic than saying that America can't do better."", ""You know and I know that just saying we're turning the corner on the war on terror, on jobs and opportunity and on building one America doesn't make it so. We have a lot of work to do."", ""The vision and values that John Edwards and I have set out in Our Plan for America can bring our country together again. We can build stronger communities. We can secure equality and strengthen opportunity. We can demand and support responsibility from all. For us, these values are not just words. They're about results. They're about the causes we champion and the people we fight for. Los valores son mas que palabras. Values are more than just words."", ""They're about good jobs for our families...good schools for our children...good prescription drug coverage for our parents and a nation that is coming together, not splitting apart."", 'John Edwards and I have a record to stand on and we have a real agenda to make America better.', 'Let me tell you what values mean to me and John Edwards:', 'Values mean having an opportunity agenda for America. That means bringing capital, small business opportunities and job creation to all of our communities – especially our central cities and the surrounding metropolitan areas. It means providing adequate funding for homeland security and port security so that the people in our metropolitan areas are able move about freely, get to good jobs and live without fear.', 'Creating opportunity also means creating good-paying jobs. More than a million Americans who were working three years ago have lost their jobs. African-American unemployment is now at 10 percent – double the rate for whites. And the new jobs finally being created pay an average of $9,000 less a year.', 'We have a plan to keep and create good paying jobs here at home. When I am president, no longer will American workers have to subsidize the loss of their own jobs.', ""We'll close tax loopholes that pay companies to move our jobs overseas – and we'll reward companies that create jobs right here in the good old USA. And we'll bring fairness back to the American workplace."", 'Values also mean giving all our children a first-rate education. Today, we see two school systems in America: one for the well off and one for the left out. Too many children of color are being told they have to lift themselves up in schools that are literally falling down. For us, values mean opening the doors of opportunity to all our children.', ""Values mean making health care affordable and accessible for all Americans. In the last four years, four million people have lost their health insurance. 44 million Americans don't have health insurance."", 'The truth is that nearly 60 percent of Hispanics and 43 percent of African Americans went without health coverage for all or part of the last two years. Today people of color are significantly more likely to suffer and die from diseases like cancer and asthma and AIDS and diabetes. And the life expectancy for Native Americans is 17 years shorter than it is for other Americans, largely because of poor health. America can do better than that.', ""When I am in the White House we are going to stop being the only industrial nation on the face of the earth that doesn't understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected or the elected. Health care is a right for all Americans."", ""We've got a plan to get the waste and greed out of our health care system and help families save up to $1,000 on their premiums."", 'And it means reaffirming the truth that America is now, and has always been, a nation of immigrants. Within the first 100 days of my administration, I will send Congress a reform bill that lets immigrants earn legalization and encourages family reunification, while protecting our borders in ways that are fairer and more effective.', 'As president, I will also restore respect for tribal sovereignty throughout the Executive Branch and re-open the doors to the White House to the first Americans. We understand the struggles our Native American brothers and sisters face. In addition to the health care crisis facing tribes, we also know that poverty is rising in America, and nowhere is it worse than on our reservations. To ensure that your voice is heard on these and other vital issues, I will appoint Native Americans to key positions in the White House and throughout my administration.', ""And I will do my part to bring more diversity into the media. Right now people of color make up 32 percent of the nation's population but only 13 percent of daily newspaper staffs. And people of color represent only a tiny fraction of the number of editors, anchors, and executives at our nation's premier news organizations. Right now only 4.2 percent of radio stations and 1.5 percent of TV stations are owned by minorities."", 'I look around at all the talent in this room and say to the management of these organizations, we can do better.', 'As president, I will expand opportunities for people of color in the media, by appointing FCC commissioners committed to enforcing equal employment and insuring that small and minority-owned broadcasters are not consolidated into extinction.', 'Thirty-nine years ago tomorrow, when Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law, he said: ""Every American citizen must have an equal right to vote. Yet the harsh fact is that in many places in this country, men and women are kept from voting simply because they are Negroes."" My friends, the harsh fact now is that in the last election, more than one million African Americans were disenfranchised in one of the most tainted election in history. We can do better – and we have to. We have to see to it in November that every vote counts – and every vote is counted.', ""Along with shared opportunity we must also demand shared responsibility. All of us, from the President in the White House to people in their homes and schools and workplaces, have to be responsible for our actions. And we owe it to all the people who follow the law to hold accountable those who don't."", ""That begins with having a president who tells the truth to the American people. It means staying vigilant to ensure that every American company plays by the rules and does right by its workers and customers. And it means giving young people alternatives to gangs and gang violence by first sending them a strong message that the violence must stop, and if it doesn't, police and prosecutors will hold them accountable, period. But second, by sending young people a strong, clear message that there is another path, and if they are willing to take that path, we will be there with them – with job training, job opportunities, and drug treatment."", 'Shared opportunity. Shared responsibility. That is how we really make our country stronger and bring real hope, real help and real opportunity to all Americans.', 'I want to thank you for doing your part every single day. No one in public life doesn\'t have some complaint, at some time, about the ""fourth estate."" But your persistent vigilance makes us all better – and it makes you watchmen on the walls of liberty.', 'I believe that this is the most important election of our lifetime. Everything is at stake. Your role in the next months is as important as any point in our shared history.', 'Your questioning, your demands for honest answers, your reporting on our progress, and your holding us accountable for our promises, are an indispensable force in moving America forward. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to measure me by my results, not just my rhetoric, by my actions, not just my words. Results matter.', ""Let's not forget the role that so many of your brothers and sisters in the media have played in exposing historic wrongs, lifting up communities of color and building one America."", 'Where would we be today if it were not for the stirring images of the civil rights movement captured for Life Magazine by the camera of Gordon Parks; or the searing war-time photojournalism of Nick Ut?', 'Where would we be without the pioneering word pictures painted by Ruben Salazar for the El Paso Herald Post and Los Angeles Times.', 'Where would we be without Carol Simpson, Frank del Olmo, Bernard Shaw, Ed Bradley or Max Robinson? Where would we be without the famed Native American historian and journalist, Arthur Caswell Parker, founder of American Indian Magazine, or Ignacio Lozano, founder of La Opinion?', 'Where would we be today without Unity 2004 and all of you?', 'So above all today, I thank you for all that you have done and all that you will do to help us become the America we were truly meant to be – the America whose best days are still to come. Thank you and now I will be happy to take questions...']",0
1,            John F. Kerry          ,"August 07, 2004","['Good morning, this is John Kerry.', 'Three years ago, the President enacted a far-reaching ban on stem cell research, shutting down some of the most promising work to prevent, treat and cure Alzheimers, Parkinsons, diabetes, AIDS and so many other life-threatening diseases.', ""Those affected by this decision already mark so many hard anniversaries of their own. The day you get a call from a doctor when he brings you the results of a diagnosis and it makes your heart sink. Or the day that people told you that they tried everything possible to make you better – and now, you were all out of options. The day you said goodbye to someone you loved, and all the days that followed that were never quite the same. Marking today's anniversary only adds to the loss and the pain."", ""Right now, more than 100 million Americans suffer from illnesses that one day could be wiped away with stem-cell therapy. Stem cells could replace damaged heart cells or cells destroyed by cancer, offering a new lease on life to those with a diagnosis that once came with an inevitable death sentence. Stem cells have the power to slow the loss of a grandmother's memory, calm the hand of an uncle with Parkinson's, save a child from a lifetime of daily insulin shots, or permanently lift a best friend from his or her wheelchair."", 'At this very moment, some of the most pioneering cures and treatments are right at our fingertips, but because of the stem cell ban, they remain beyond our reach.', ""This is not the way we do things in America. Here in America, we don't sacrifice science for ideology. We are a land of discovery – a place where innovators and optimists are free to dream and explore. Where government encourages creativity and entrepreneurship instead of stifling it. Where we're always searching for the next breakthrough, always pushing the boundaries of our knowledge. And that's why we must lift the ban on stem cell research – and do so immediately. Every day that we wait, more than 3,000 Americans lose their lives to diseases that may someday be treatable because of stem cell research."", 'We must make funding for this research and other important scientific work a priority in our universities and our medical community. And we must secure more funding for it at agencies like the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.', 'Above all, we must look to the future not with fear, but with the hope and the faith that advances in science will advance our highest ideals.', 'We know that progress has always brought with it the worry that this time, we have gone too far. Believe it or not, there was a time when some questioned the morality of heart transplants. Not too long ago, we heard the same kind of arguments against the biotechnology research that now saves stroke victims and those with leukemia.', 'People of good will and good sense can resolve the ethical issues without stopping life-saving research. America has long led the world in great discoveries, always upholding the highest standards, with our breakthroughs and our beliefs always going hand-in-hand. And when it comes to stem cell research, we will demand no less.', ""So to all of you who sit by the bedside of someone you love, losing hope about what the future holds. To those who lie awake at night, wondering whether you'll be around for a best friend's wedding, a daughter's graduation, a grandson's first steps. To those who pray each day for cures that are now beyond our reach – I want you to know that help is on the way."", ""I want you to hold on, and keep faith, because come next January, when John Edwards and I are sworn into office, we're going to create a new anniversary – one that will be a cause for celebration. We're going to lift the ban on stem cell research. We're going to listen to our scientists and stand up for science. We're going to say yes to knowledge, yes to discovery, and yes to a new era of hope for all Americans."", 'Thanks for listening.']",0
2,            John F. Kerry          ,"August 12, 2004","['Over the last few weeks, John Edwards and I have made our way across this country we love, from sea to shining sea, because we believe in America and we believe we can do better.', ""And at every stop we've made, from great cities to the great Southwest, from the flag-draped front porches of Main Street America to the small family farms that dot the Midwest, we've met Americans who believe that too."", 'While millions are struggling to find work, and millions more are struggling to pay the bills, these folks hold on to an optimism that is both courageous and classically American. They know we can do better. They know our best days lie ahead. And they still believe in an America where a willingness to work hard is rewarded with the opportunity to earn a decent living and the chance to get ahead.', ""John Edwards and I think it's time we built an economy that honors those values. And we think it's time the American people had a government that lives by them."", 'We believe a stronger America at home is built on a strong middle-class.', ""That's why today, after days of listening and learning about the hopes and concerns of hardworking people from every corner of America, and after more bad economic news for middle-class families, I'd like to talk about our real economic plan to build a stronger America."", ""It's a plan that makes us stronger by creating good-paying jobs here instead of shipping jobs overseas. A plan that makes us stronger by giving middle-class families tax breaks, not bigger bills. A plan that makes us stronger by revitalizing American manufacturing, helping our businesses become more competitive, and investing in the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow. And it's a plan that is our answer to the everyday Americans who have shared their dreams with us every moment of this journey. Theirs are the concerns we share. Theirs are the hopes we hold. And theirs are the stories that are the heart of our campaign to build a stronger America."", ""The road to this America takes us in a new and better direction. It's based on telling the American people the truth – not selling them shop-worn slogans. But, in the last week, we've been told over and over again that America has turned the corner."", ""When we've had four years of disappearing manufacturing jobs that have put millions out of work, the Americans I've met don't think we've turned the corner."", ""When we've had four years of falling wages, rising health care costs, and a shrinking middle-class, the Americans I've met don't think we've turned the corner."", ""When we've had four years of people working harder and harder and still not getting ahead, the Americans I've met don't think we've turned the corner."", ""Too many of the Americans I've met over the last few weeks not only don't think we've turned the corner – they feel like they've been backed into a corner by the policies of the last four years – rising unemployment...exploding deficits...falling wages....American jobs shipped overseas."", ""The sad fact is: Too many of our fellow citizens don't have to read about how disappointing last month's job numbers were, because they're living the disappointment. They don't need to be told about the rising costs of health care, because they're the ones who can't afford to take their child to the doctor. And they don't need to open the paper to find out that the new jobs being created pay $9,000 less than the ones we've lost, because they're the ones who open their paychecks and wonder how they'll pay the bills."", ""The response of this Administration – of those in charge -- is to tell us that this is the best economy we've ever had. And we're told anyone who thinks otherwise is a pessimist. Well, here is our answer: There is nothing more pessimistic than saying America can't do better."", ""There's a very simple reason we've gone four years without a plan to fix our economy: no one in the White House thought anything was broken. And they still don't. They're just fine with the same old failed policies of the past. That's why, like Herbert Hoover, they say prosperity is still just around the corner. And that's why we're still waiting to hear a plan for the next four years."", ""We can do better and we will. We're the optimists. For us, this is a country of the future. We're the can do people. And let's not forget what we did in the 1990s. We balanced the budget. We paid down the debt. We created 23 million new jobs. We lifted millions out of poverty and we lifted the standard of living for the middle class. We just need to believe in ourselves – and have the right leadership and the right policies -- and we can do it again."", 'We can make choices that widen the circle of opportunity for all Americans, not just the select few. We can build an economy with a growing middle-class where everyone has the chance to succeed. And we can finally create jobs and bring tax relief to all of our families.', ""Over the last four years, again and again, we were promised that tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals would create millions of new jobs. Instead, we've lost jobs, and these unaffordable tax cuts have led America into deficits as far as the eye can see. This Administration is the first since Herbert Hoover's to actually lose jobs on its watch – 1.8 million jobs. Just last month, there were only 32,000 jobs created in the entire country – a pace far behind what is needed to keep up with the 2 million college graduates who will enter the workforce this spring."", ""And now, to add insult to injury, just yesterday the other side talked about a national sales tax. At least that's what they call it. I call it one of the largest tax increases on the middle class in American history. This is from an Administration that has offered almost no new ideas for our economy – and the few they have proposed have only hurt middle class families. This one is no different. It's a twenty to thirty percent national sales tax -- on top of the state and local sales taxes that Americans already pay. This tax will hurt small business, it will hurt jobs, and it will hit the pocketbooks of those who need tax relief the most."", ""Middle-class families can't afford four more years of a tax plan that drives up unemployment, drives up the deficit, and drives up their tax burden and the costs of health care, child care, and college tuition. When tax cuts for the very wealthiest Americans are your first, second, and only priority, you don't have anything left to take care of health care premiums that have risen over $2,600. You don't have anything left to take care of skyrocketing property taxes in states struggling to pay for these deficits. And you don't have anything left to take care of the cost of child care and college tuition that has risen over $1,200."", ""When tax cuts for the wealthiest are your only priority, you don't have anything left for middle-class Americans – and it's middle-class Americans who end up paying the largest share."", 'I will be a president who stands with the middle class and stands for fairness', ""We believe it's time America had tax cuts that work for all Americans. We believe it's time we had tax cuts that help create good-paying jobs – right here in America. And, after four years of shifting the tax burden from those with the most to those most struggling to make ends meet, we believe it's time that America's tax code reflected America's moral code. And when I'm President, it will."", 'I have a comprehensive economic plan for a stronger America that will allow us to create jobs and keep more good jobs here in America. It offers a long-term strategy to win our economic future, and it gives our workers the skills and the training they need to compete and succeed in a new economy. And, most importantly, it includes tax cuts that will create jobs and provide relief for middle-class families struggling to make ends meet – tax cuts that are paid for without increasing the deficit one single dime.', 'First, we start with a Jobs First Tax Cut strategy that will replace deficit-expanding tax cuts for the few with job-creating tax cuts for every American.', ""Let me tell you precisely what this Jobs First Tax Cut strategy includes. It starts by closing tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping our jobs overseas. Instead of supporting an economic policy that thinks sending jobs overseas is good for America, we will provide tax incentives for companies that create and keep jobs where they belong – in the good ol' U.S.A."", 'We value an America that exports products, not jobs – and we believe American workers should never have to subsidize the loss of their own job.', 'To the taxpaying businesses of America out there, our Jobs First Tax Cut strategy takes the savings from closing these loopholes to cut taxes for 99% of you. To the small businesses and manufacturers who decide to add more employees to the payroll, we will provide a New Jobs Tax Credit for every person you hire.', ""We will completely eliminate capital gains taxes for those who make long-term investments in the small businesses and entrepreneurs who have always been America's engine for innovation and job creation. And to those small business owners who want to hire more employees but cannot afford to insure them, we will give you up to a 50% tax cut on your health care contributions when you cover your workers."", 'My plan focuses on the rising cost of health care for families and small businesses, because I know that no working parent ever feels they are turning the corner unless they have a job that not only provides a decent wage, but the heath care that every family needs and deserves.', 'We need a president who understands that the health of our economy is tied to the health of our citizens.', ""Finally, my tax plan will make our tax code fair. You know, our tax code has gone from 14 pages to 17,000 pages. It's time to crack down on tax shelters, taking Enron's page out of the tax code so we can add another page for working families."", 'Second, our middle-class tax cuts will raise middle-class incomes.', ""We're tired of people just getting by; we want people to get ahead. So to help you pay for health care, we'll offer a tax break and health care reform to lower your premiums up to $1,000. To help you cover the rising costs of child care, we'll offer a tax credit up to $1,000 to cover those costs so your kids have a safe place to go while you work. And to give your child the chance to go to college, we'll offer a tax break on up to $4,000 in tuition."", 'To pay for all this, we make sure that 98 percent of all Americans keep their tax cuts, while rolling back only the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals who make over $200,000 a year so that we can invest in health care, education, and job-creation. They will go back to paying the same taxes they paid when Bill Clinton was president – a time when the rich got richer, and so did everyone else.', 'And to help folks in states where these unaffordable tax cuts for the wealthy have driven up deficits and killed jobs, we will offer $25 billion in relief to lower tuition costs, keep property taxes down, and make sure we can afford to defend our homeland.', ""Third, we believe it's time for Washington to lives within a budget just like you do. We will make sure that these tax cuts don't add one dime to the deficit so that we can protect Social Security and so that our children aren't paying for them for the rest of their lives. Four years ago, this Administration was handed a record surplus. Today, we have record deficits. Passing or proposing $6 trillion in spending over the last four years without paying for a dime of it has jeopardized job creation and the foundation of economic strength in America."", ""Our plan will cut the deficit in half in four years by ending tax giveaways that are nothing more than corporate welfare – and we will make government go back to a simple rule: pay as you go. And we will cut the waste from our government – cutting 100,000 contractors we don't need, cutting the top-level bureaucracy that has grown over the last four years, cutting government agencies that have outlived their purposes."", ""Finally, our economic plan is not just about economic relief today, it's also about making the long-term investments in our nation's future. If we want America to thrive in the long run, we must invest more in our people and their ideas, in science and technology, so that we can create high-tech, high-wage jobs in industries that are already improving the quality of our lives. We will offer tax credits to help us seize the possibilities of the Broadband Revolution and make Internet access available to all of America's families. We will offer tax credits to buy and produce the fuel-efficient cars of the future, so that we can finally build an Energy Independent America. And we will give our workers the education and the job training that the jobs of tomorrow require today."", 'Our economic plan for America is based on the values we hold as Americans: that we should reward work, make sure Americans have a chance to work, and give them a chance to get ahead when they do.', ""We value jobs that pay you more not less than you earned before. We value jobs where, when you put in a week's work, you can actually pay your bills, provide for your children, and lift up the quality of your life. We value an America where the middle class is not being squeezed, but doing better."", ""These aren't Democratic values. These aren't Republican values. They're American values. We believe in them. They're who we are. And if we honor them, if we believe in ourselves, we can build an America that's stronger at home and respected in the world."", 'You know, the last time a campaign took a cross-country trip across America was when Harry Truman ran for President in 1948. Their whistle-stop tour steamed through many of the small towns ours has, and when it reached the coasts of California, the man from Missouri who had spent a lifetime given ‘em hell told the crowd, ""I wish I were 18 instead of 64. I would like to see the next 50 years because I think the greatest age in the history of the world is in front of us, and that age depends entirely on the proper leadership in the United States of America.""', 'My friends, we can do more than turn corners. We can take a new path that will lead America to a better place and greater times.', 'We can do more than turn corners. We can turn our economy around, and build one that works for every American.', ""John Edwards and I are ready to lead, and we have a plan to get us there – a plan to build a better America. Like Franklin Roosevelt, my test is not whether an idea is Democrat or Republican, but whether it will work. My tax plan to create jobs for the middle class will work. And it's going to put our economy back on track."", 'We can do this. We can reach for the next dream. We can look to the next horizon. For America, the hope is there. The sun is rising.

I am proud to be a lifetime member of this organization and grateful for your continued deep commitment to veterans and to the defense and security of our nation. For more than 100 years now, you have had many distinguished veterans come before you – some Republican, some Democrat, some presidents. But as a fellow veteran, I can proudly say that there is one title that is more important than all, and that is patriot. You have all earned that title and I am proud to stand with you today.', 'A few weeks ago, at the Democratic National Convention, I told the American people that I was reporting for duty. I did not say that lightly. I said it paying homage to and drawing strength from my crewmates on stage, the more than 500 delegates who were veterans in the Fleet Center and especially all of you -- every man and woman who has ever worn the uniform of the United States armed forces. We understand that the duty to serve goes on throughout our lives. That is what really brings us here today: our continued resolve to defend America so that all can share in the blessings of freedom. And let there be no doubt – when I am president, you will have a true brother in arms in the White House who understands that those who fought for their country abroad should never have to fight for what they were promised at home.', ""In the spirit of all the men and women in uniform who we honor here, let me offer this pledge: As president, I will always remember that America's security begins and ends with the soldier, sailor, airman, Marine and Coastguardsman – with every man and every woman in our armed services who has ever stood guard at the gates of freedom. Today, I salute each and every one of you for your commitment, strength and extraordinary courage. America says thank you – and we all join in a special salute to Greatest Generation vets whose memorial finally stands proudly in a place of honor on the Mall in Washington. Thank you for your extraordinary example as citizen soldiers."", ""I also want to speak directly for a moment to those currently risking their lives as faraway as Iraq and Afghanistan. America's prayers are with you. We honor your service, thank you for your sacrifice and pledge to stand with your families as you stand for ours."", ""Like veterans of all wars past, today's fighting men and women, deserve our prayers and support and then, when they come home, they deserve the respect and welcome of a grateful nation. After all, the first definition of patriotism is to keep faith with those who have worn the uniform of the United States of America."", 'One of the best ways to do that is to make sure that those who have served us on the frontlines return to an America that gives them the tools to build strong families and strong communities here at home. This means transitional assistance to help all those returning from war, struggling to readjust to civilian life, and coping with the scars of battle, those both seen and unseen. This is about keeping a sacred promise. It is about love of country. And it is about protecting those who have risked their lives to protect ours.', ""In recent days, you have heard from some who have claimed that the job is getting done for veterans. Well, just saying the job is getting done doesn't make it so. My friends, let me tell you when the job will be done. The job will be done when 500,000 veterans are not excluded from the VA healthcare system. The job will be done when we're not closing VA hospitals, so that veterans can't reach the care they need. The job will be done when veterans are not asked for increasing co-payments, enrollment fees, and other charges to shift the burden of care to other veterans and drive more than a million veterans out of the system."", 'The job will be done when 400,000 military retirees get real concurrent receipt. The job will be done when there are no homeless veterans on the streets of America. The job will be done when more than 320,000 veterans no longer are waiting for decisions on disability claims and another 100,000 are not awaiting appeals decisions. The job will be done when the VA Secretary does not have to complain that he needs more than the White House wanted to give him. And the job will be done when the family of 21-year-old Jay Briseno, a veteran facing a lifetime of disability, doesn\'t have to sleep at his bedside because the VA can\'t afford to give him the round-the-clock nursing care he needs. It is clear: when it comes to protecting America\'s 26 million veterans and their families we are far from being able to claim, ""mission accomplished.""', ""As President, I will stand with you to complete that mission. The sacrifices that you have made on the battlefield are well known. But what is not as well known is how hard we have fought after we returned from service to keep faith with our fellow soldiers. How we fought to get additional funds for VA hospitals that couldn't provide adequate care. How we put together the first outreach groups to help deal with post traumatic stress disorder. How we pushed to get the GI Bill extended so that no vet lost their chance for a better future. And how we won increases for veteran's allowances and living expenses."", 'We kept faith. Together, with the help from the leadership of the VFW we can be proud that we put in place the most thorough, the most exhaustive, the most extensive effort to account for missing, captured or dead in all the history of human warfare. We made that happen – we veterans and we should all be proud of keeping faith. I am especially proud that together with Bob Smith and John McCain we led and won this fight.', 'When I got involved in this issue, there were hundreds of individuals whose fates were unknown. Today that number has been reduced to 35. That means that families now have the peace of mind and the comfort of knowing that their loved ones are resting in peace. I went back to Vietnam to search for our POWs and missing because I believe, as you do, that a soldier never leaves anyone behind.', 'That is why I fought for the legislation that allowed veterans to be treated in VA hospitals for devastating Agent Orange conditions like cancer and neurological disorders. Again, we kept faith.', 'I will continue to stand with you as president, leading the fight for a Military Family Bill of Rights and leading the fight for full, mandatory funding for Veterans health care.', 'Military families are going through difficult times these days. Many of their loved ones are in faraway places, leaving them to care for their families alone. The last thing our servicemen and women need on their minds is the stress of wondering if their loved ones back home will be okay. What they need is a president who protects their families while they are putting their lives on the line protecting the American family. That means making sure families have competitive pay, good housing, decent health care and quality education for their children.', ""Keeping faith with our veterans also means making sure they get full concurrent receipt. Today, we have only partially met this obligation. I'm not going to come to the VFW to tell you the job is done when it is not done. If you earned a pension – it's yours – just like in the private sector. If you get a disability payment, it is because you have suffered. I don't believe you subtract what you suffered from what you earned. As president, I won't stop fighting until our veterans get the full disability payments they deserve."", ""You and I who once left our families and our shores to defend the principles that make America great, understand more than most the cost of keeping our country free. When you hear that more than 940 American troops have been lost on the battlefield of Iraq and that more than 6,200 of our troops have been wounded, some disabled for a lifetime ... these are more than numbers to you and me. These are our brothers and sisters ... our sons and daughters ... America's heroes."", 'They testify to the truth that we will never back down in defense of freedom. We will use superior military force to overcome any enemy. Let me be clear: like you, I defended this country as a young man. And I will defend it as president. I will never hesitate to use force when it is required. Any attack will be met with a swift and certain response. Any imminent threat to our security will be dealt with swiftly and severely. I will never give any nation or international institution a veto over our national security. And I will build a stronger American military.', 'But, in these dangerous times, there is a right way and a wrong way to be strong. Strength is more than tough words.', ""After September 11th, I am proud that all our people rallied to the President's call for unity to meet the danger. There were no Democrats, there were no Republicans there were only Americans."", 'How we wish it had stayed that way.', ""But since then, we have become a country divided over Iraq – and it didn't have to be that way."", ""As veterans, we know what kids go through when they are carrying an M-16 in a dangerous place and they can't tell friend from foe. We know what they go through when they're out on patrol at night and they don't know what's coming around the next bend. We know what it's like to write letters home telling your family that everything's all right when you're not sure that's true."", ""I know what we have to do in Iraq. We need a President who has the credibility to bring our allies to our side because that's the right way to get the job done in Iraq and bring our troops home."", 'We need to bring in NATO and other nations to share the cost and burdens. Right now, the United States is shouldering the lions share of this effort. Ninety percent of all coalition forces and nearly ninety percent of coalition coffins are draped with American flags. The American taxpayers are also paying the vast share of the cost of this war.', ""We also need to massively improve and accelerate our training of Iraqi police and security forces so they can defend their own country; and we need ensure that there is far greater security to provide the credible elections in 2005 critical to advance Iraq's transition to stable, representative democracy."", 'As President, I will always ask hard questions and I will demand hard evidence. I will immediately reform the intelligence system – so policy is guided by facts, and facts are never distorted by politics.', ""As president, I will wage war with the lessons I learned in war. Before you go to battle, you have to be able to look a parent or family member in the eye and truthfully say: We tried everything possible to avoid sending your son or daughter into harm's way. But we had no choice."", 'And now, with so much at stake in the struggle against Al Qaeda the American people want to hear, in plain words the answer to a simple question. How are we going to get the terrorists before they get us? Just what is our strategy – not just for striking back against the terrorists, but for defeating their aims, destroying their movement, discrediting their cause, and bringing old and new friends to our side? What is our long-term strategy for making America safer?', ""Over the course of this campaign, I have laid out my plans to reshape and rebuild the American military so that it is ready to fight tomorrow's wars, not yesterday's. As a combat veteran who has walked in your shoes, I know that the first duty of a commander in chief is to make sure that our troops are the best trained, best equipped fighting force in the world. And to never send them into battle without a plan to win the peace."", ""That is why I have called for adding 40,000 new troops, not in Iraq, but to relieve the pressure on our overstretched forces. The fact is, the war in Iraq has taken a real toll on our armed services. Ninety percent of the Army's active duty combat divisions are either in Iraq, have been to Iraq, or are on their way."", 'I will also double our Army Special Forces so we can find and get the terrorists before they get us.', ""And we must end the stop-loss and involuntary recall of troops that amounts to nothing more than a back-door draft. To fight this war, we have called up our Guard and Reserves at historic levels. And many of these units are being pushed to the limit. The Administration has extended tours of duty, delayed retirements, and prevented enlisted personnel from leaving the service. And when these troops come home, many have lost the job they left. We're going to see to it that everyone who fought for this country has a good job when they come back to this country."", ""At the same time, we must strengthen our homeland security and do everything we can to prevent another 9/11. We shouldn't be letting ninety-five percent of container ships come into our ports without ever being physically inspected. We shouldn't be leaving our nuclear and chemical plants without enough protection. And we must make sure first responders have the training and equipment they need."", ""But, as you know, winning the war on terror demands a team effort. We all know that the best intelligence comes from working cooperatively with other nations – through real intelligence sharing and joint operations. That's why for months now, I have been calling for the creation of a National Director of Intelligence with the authority to oversee all of our intelligence agencies."", 'Last month, the 9/11 Commission embraced many of these ideas. I have urged the President and the Congress to act – and act now – to implement them. But if we are going to win this war, we will have to listen to another profoundly important recommendation made by the Commission. ""Long term success demands the use of all elements of national power: diplomacy, intelligence, covert action, law enforcement, economic policy, foreign aid, public diplomacy and homeland defense.""', 'As President, I will fight a smarter, more effective war on terror. We will deploy every tool in our arsenal: our economic as well as our military might; our principles as well as our firepower. Only then will be able to tell the terrorists: You will lose and we will win.', 'Finally, I want to say something about the plan that the President announced on Monday to withdraw 70,000 troops from Asia and Europe. Nobody wants to bring troops home more than those of us who have fought in foreign wars. But it needs to be done at the right time and in a sensible way. This is not that time or that way.', ""Let's be clear: the President's vaguely stated plan does not strengthen our hand in the war against terror. And in no way relieves the strain on our overextended military personnel. And this hastily announced plan raises more doubts about our intentions and our commitments than it provides real answers."", 'For example, why are we unilaterally withdrawing 12,000 troops from the Korean Peninsula at the very time we are negotiating with North Korea – a country thatreally has nuclear weapons? As Senator John McCain said, ""I\'m particularly concerned about moving troops out of South Korea when North Korea has probably never been more dangerous than any time since the end of the Korean War."" This is clearly the wrong signal to send at the wrong time.', ""With al Qaeda operating in 60 countries, we need closer alliances in every part of the world to fight and win the war on terrorism. So, as president, I will be a commander in chief who renews our alliances based on shared interests and a common vision for a safer world. For more than 50 years, our allies have joined with us to say: the future doesn't belong to fear; it belongs to freedom."", 'As veterans, we know we can win the war on terror. As men and women who have worn the uniform of our country, you know better than most that we can make our nation stronger at home and respected in the world.', 'And so, whether the issue is standing by our vets and their families or standing up for our principles, our values and our freedom, the big question before us is not just who will lead America. It is whether America will continue to lead in the world.', 'I am running for President because I believe that if we honor our highest values and do right by our men and women in uniform, America will continue to be a beacon of hope and freedom for all the world.', 'Thank you for your service to our country and God bless you and God bless the United States of America.']",0
4,            John F. Kerry          ,"August 19, 2004","[""Talk about a warm welcome! It's great to see my good friend, Harold Schaitberger. As you know, Harold and I spent a lot of time together in Iowa and New Hampshire. He's a terrific campaigner, and an outstanding leader. And I want to congratulate him and Vinnie – I can only hope that our re-election in 2008 goes as well as theirs did yesterday."", ""I'd also like to take a moment to honor a young man whose courage, compassion, and love for life were an inspiration to us all. Mattie Stepanek was a poet, a philosopher, and a peacemaker – and he was also your number one fan. As hard as it is to lose him, he will never be forgotten."", ""I'd also like to remember the brothers of Local 1009. It's hard to believe it's been five years since that warehouse in Worcester went up in flames. Six brave men went in. None of them came out alive. And as I stood with those families, I looked them in the eyes, and promised that their brothers, fathers, sons and husbands would never be forgotten. And I know they haven't been."", ""And neither have those who gave their lives on September 11th, the day that so many of America's finest rushed into burning towers so that others could rush out. They didn't ask questions. They didn't look back. And three hundred and forty-three of them made the ultimate sacrifice. Their courage lifted our nation."", 'Finally, I want to pay tribute to your brothers and sisters who, at this very moment, are on the frontlines in Iraq and Afghanistan. May God protect them and bring them home safely to their families and our country.', 'Now, as you all know, it\'s been a pretty exciting couple of months for our campaign. Back in early July, I was talking with an old friend of mine, and he asked me what I\'d been up to. I told him, ""Well, I\'ve been gearing up for that big event in Boston, working on my big speech, practicing every day."" And he said, ""Yup, I\'ll bet you have."" And I said, ""This is one of the most important speeches of my career."" And he said, ""It sure is."" And I said, ""I really want to hit this one out of the park."" And he said, ""John, don\'t you worry, I\'m sure you\'ll do just fine at the Democratic Convention.""', 'And I said, ""Democratic Convention? Who\'s talking about the Democratic convention? I was talking about the IAFF Convention!""', ""In all seriousness, I'm so proud to be here with all of you today. Every day, you keep our families and communities safe. Every day you risk your lives to protect ours. Every day you give so much to this country we love. Today, I want to talk about how we can give back – about how we can give you the support you need, and the respect you deserve."", ""It's been a long journey to this moment. Since I entered this race a year and a half ago, I've traveled from one end of this country to the other – from great cities to the great Southwest, from the flag-draped front porches of Main Street America to the small family farms that dot the Midwest. I'm proud that we've made this great journey together."", 'All of you here today stood with me right from the beginning – and you never left my side. In those long days in Iowa, you were there. In those cold days in New Hampshire, you were there. When the polls were down, and they counted us out, you never gave up hope. And today, wherever I go, I look up, and the first thing I see are those gold and black T-shirts, and those gold and black signs – and I know that once again, my friends are by my side.', 'Through these long months, you have shown what we always knew was true: Firefighters never give up. Firefighters never leave a brother or sister behind. And no matter how tough it gets, firefighters can take the heat.', ""These are the values you live by, day in and day out, when you kiss your families goodbye, and head to the station – knowing full well that with the sound of an alarm, you might be called into harms way. I know what that's like. And more than thirty years ago, I learned an important lesson – when you're under attack, the best thing to do is turn your boat into the attacker. That's what I intend to do today."", ""Over the last week or so, a group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth has been attacking me. Of course, this group isn't interested in the truth – and they're not telling the truth. They didn't even exist until I won the nomination for president."", ""But here's what you really need to know about them. They're funded by hundreds of thousands of dollars from a Republican contributor out of Texas. They're a front for the Bush campaign. And the fact that the President won't denounce what they're up to tells you everything you need to know – he wants them to do his dirty work."", 'Thirty years ago, official Navy reports documented my service in Vietnam and awarded me the Silver Star, the Bronze Star and three Purple Hearts. Thirty years ago, this was the plain truth. It still is. And I still carry the shrapnel in my leg from a wound in Vietnam.', ""As firefighters you risk your lives everyday. You know what it's like to see the truth in the moment. You're proud of what you've done – and so am I."", 'Of course, the President keeps telling people he would never question my service to our country. Instead, he watches as a Republican-funded attack group does just that. Well, if he wants to have a debate about our service in Vietnam, here is my answer: ""Bring it on.""', ""I'm not going to let anyone question my commitment to defending America – then, now, or ever. And I'm not going to let anyone attack the sacrifice and courage of the men who saw battle with me."", 'And let me make this commitment today: their lies about my record will not stop me from fighting for jobs, health care, and our security – the issues that really matter to the American people.', ""The situation in Iraq is a mess. That is the President's responsibility and he owes the American people an answer."", ""America is on track to lose more jobs than it's gained under George Bush and he supports a tax code that rewards companies for shipping jobs overseas. He owes the American people an answer."", 'Health care costs have exploded out of control. The President has done nothing and he owes the American people an answer.', ""The middle class is paying a bigger share of America's tax burden. The President needs to answer to the American people why that is fair."", ""Unfortunately, those in the White House are coming from a different place than you and I. They see things a little differently than you and I. They tell us that today, when it comes to the issues that matter most, we're getting the job done."", ""Well, just saying the job is getting done doesn't make it so. My friends, let me tell you when the job will be done."", ""The job will be done when every firehouse in America has the firefighters and the equipment they need to protect our communities. Right now, two-thirds of firehouses are understaffed, and we're not spending one dime to fund the SAFER Act."", 'The job will be done when all our firefighters have the resources to fight the war on terror here at home. Right now, in too many places, your budgets are being cut to cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans.', 'And, my friends, the job will be done when we stop opening firehouses in Baghdad while closing them down here in the United States of America.', ""For four years, we've heard a lot of talk about values. But values are not just words. They're what we live by. They're about the choices we make, the causes we champion, and the people we fight for."", ""Let me tell you about my values. The way I see it, all of you are full-time heroes, and you deserve nothing less than America's full-time support."", ""That's why, for nineteen years in the Senate, I've fought for better equipment and training, for tracking technology and workplace protections. I sponsored the Federal Presumptive Disability legislation, because when federal firefighters get sick because of their job, they deserve our help. And I've fought for collective bargaining for all employees – including federal employees – and I'll take on anyone who tries to take it away."", ""And that's just the beginning. When John Edwards and I are in the White House, we're going to fund the FIRE Act and the SAFER Act. We're going to create the Father Mychal Judge fund to hire 100,000 new firefighters all across America. And we're going to be an Administration that stands with labor. Let us never forget that every single one of the firefighters who went up the stairs of those burning towers, and through the doors of that warehouse in Worcester – all of them were members of organized labor. They believed in the right to organize...the right to overtime pay...the right to have a Secretary of Labor who comes from labor. And we do too. Those are our values, and we're going to live and lead by them every day that we're in the White House. And that's how we're going to get the job done."", ""Finally, we're going to really get the job done by creating an economy that works for you and your families, where when you work hard, you can pay your bills and create a better life for your children."", ""Right now, middle class Americans are being squeezed like never before. In the last three years, we've lost 1.8 million private sector jobs. And the new jobs being created pay $9,000 less than the ones we've lost. At the same time, gas prices are up, childcare costs are up, tuition is up, and family income has fallen $1,500. As a result, today, we've got people working two jobs, three jobs, just to get by. That's not the American way."", 'To make matters worse, health care costs are through the roof. The average American family has seen their premiums increase by more than $2,600 in just the last three years. And I know that some of you have seen the results at the bargaining table, where you win an increase in wages only to see it disappear to pay for health care.', ""This is bad news for our families and even worse news for our economy. Studies show that rising costs have forced many employers – especially those in industries that pay high wages – to slow their hiring. And many have begun hiring more part-time and temporary workers, who often don't get health insurance at all. So we're losing good jobs and replacing them with ones that just don't pay the bills."", ""When I'm President, America will stop being the only advanced country that doesn't understand that health care is not a privilege for the elected or the connected or the wealthy – but a right for all Americans. John Edwards and I have a plan to reduce health care costs and turn our economy around. We're going to provide tax credits to make health insurance more affordable. And we're going to let all Americans buy into the same plan available to members of Congress. In total, we'll cut the average family's premium by $1,000."", ""The issues I've been talking about today – these aren't Republican issues or Democratic issues. They're American values. And frankly, it doesn't make one bit of difference to me what party you belong to or who you've voted for in the past. That's not what this election is about."", ""This election is about building an America that's stronger at home and respected around the world. Where families sleep soundly at night knowing you have what you need to do your jobs. An America where we once again honor those who serve our communities and protect our families."", ""There's a simple rule you follow in every fire you fight: You never go in alone – you always have a brother or sister by your side. Well, today, I want you to know that come next January, you will have a brother in the White House who stands with you every hour of every day. I will be a president who goes into the Oval Office every morning knowing that my job is to help you do yours. I will work my heart out for you, and I will never let you down."", ""But once again, I can't get there without your help. In the closing weeks of this campaign, I'm going to be traveling all across this country, talking to Americans about our values and our vision for the future. And I need you to do the same. I need you to go back to your states and knock on every door, make every call, and register every voter you can. Tell people about who we are, what we stand for, and what we're going to do for America. And on election day, you make sure that every single person you've reached goes to the polls and makes their voice heard. In a race like this, we can't afford to lose a single vote."", ""This isn't going to be easy, but firefighters are no strangers to tough challenges. I know that working together, we can take back America for its heroes. We can reach for the next dream. We can look to the next horizon. For America, the hope is there. The sun is rising.

And I can't help but noting that at least five presidents – Grant, Cleveland, Taft, Teddy Roosevelt, and, of course, Lincoln spoke here as candidates. So I've been kind of looking forward to this speech."", 'But to me, this contest this year is not just about winning a campaign.

That is what this election should be about. But from the other side, we have seen a calculated effort to evade that debate. The Bush campaign and its allies have turned to the tactics of fear and smear because they can't talk about jobs, health care, energy independence, and rebuilding our alliances – the real issues that matter to the American people. They have no plans, no positive vision and no understanding of an urgent and undeniable truth -- a stronger America begins at home."", 'Next week, the Republicans will hold their convention here in New York.

But words, slogans, and personal attacks cannot disguise what they have done – and left undone. They are going to say that we've turned the corner; that the job is getting done. They are even going to claim, as they already have, that this is the best economy of our lifetimes. They have obviously decided that some people will believe anything, no matter how fictional or how far-fetched, if they just repeat it often enough. That's how they have run their administration; that's how they're running their campaign and that's how they will run their convention. I believe the American people are smarter than that. You can't cover up reality with a few empty slogans. You can't lead America by misleading the American people."", ""I don't believe that four years of lost jobs, lower wages, higher health care costs, higher tuitions and tax cuts for the few are the best we can do.

Bush has put the narrow interests of the few ahead of the interests of most Americans.', ""The middle class has always been the moral and economic backbone of this nation. That's why Franklin Roosevelt signed the G.I. Bill to help people go to college, buy a house, and build their wealth. Under Bill Clinton, we created 23 million new jobs, lifted 7 million Americans out of poverty, and sent millions more Americans to college. The middle class built this nation. They work hard, pay their bills, and do right by their families. Our country ought to do right by them."", 'Today, there is no more powerful example of the fundamental choice we face in this election than the issue of the economy.', 'The Bush administration blamed a weak economy on events out of their control.', 'Then they made a big promise of six million new jobs by the middle of 2004. They, in fact, have lost 1.8 million jobs. So now they offer another strategy: denial and attack. And as we will hear at their convention – the pretense that they finally have a plan for jobs.', ""But this is the reality: No jobs. No record they're willing to run on. And no real plans for the future."", ""And you can't make up for four years in a few days of a convention and a few weeks of campaigning."", ""They say our economy has turned a corner. That's not what John Edwards and I are hearing from people from one end of this country to the other."", 'America can do better. And the fundamental choice voters face is this: do we accept an economy that benefits the special interests or do we want an economy that works for the middle class?', ""It is a choice between an administration that says it's right to reward companies for shipping American jobs overseas – and a new leadership that will close those tax loopholes and provide incentives to create the good paying jobs of the future here in the United States of America."", ""It is a choice between the first Administration since Herbert Hoover to preside over a net loss of jobs – or new leadership with a plan to create jobs that pay people more, not $9,000 less than they earned before.

We will do it by passing the reforms John McCain and I have fought for to end corporate welfare – and by making government live by the same rules our families have to follow: pay as you go.', 'And both fairness and fiscal responsibility depend on another fundamental choice -- between tax cuts for the few and tax cuts for the middle class. Should we continue a failed fiscal policy that says to middle class families: Tax cuts for Halliburton and Enron and those who make more than $200,000 a year are more important than tax cuts for you?', 'As President, I will put the middle class first. John Edwards and I have a plan to cut taxes for the middle class and working families – to help them pay for health care, child care, and sending a son or daughter to college.', 'When we talk about the economy, we talk about jobs. But there is another side to the economy where there is a fundamental choice – and that is health care. When health care is more expensive...when co-pays and deductibles go through the roof...businesses, especially small businesses, are burdened by staggering health care costs. And that makes it harder to hire workers, harder to grow and harder to expand.', 'In the last four years, four million people have lost their health insurance. 44 million Americans are now without any health coverage at all. And middle class families are struggling to afford health costs that are going through the roof. Today, we have an administration that puts the interests of HMOs and big drug companies over the interests of patients and seniors and health care providers.', ""In a Kerry-Edwards Administration, we will see to it that that America is no longer the only industrialized nation in the world that doesn't understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected and the elected – it is a right for every single American."", ""We have a plan to get the greed and waste out of the system – and save the average family up to $1,000 a year in their premiums. At the same time, we will make health care affordable and accessible for all. Under our plan, you will get to pick your own doctors – and doctors and patients, not insurance company bureaucrats, will make medical decisions. You will be able to buy less expensive medicines from countries like Canada. And instead of this Administration's multi-billion dollar windfall for the big drug companies, we will pass a real prescription drug benefit for all seniors."", 'This election is also a choice between a country where men and women who work and save all their lives suddenly find their pensions disappearing into thin air and the executives who looted them bailing out on golden parachutes. Or leadership that says everybody in America – from the White House to the boardroom to Main Street – has a responsibility to play by the rules, obey the law and treat people with dignity.', 'On almost every issue before us, we face the same fundamental choice – between the narrow interests of the few and the future of the vast majority of Americans. It is a choice between an anti-science policy that gives in to right-wing pressures – or new leadership that believes in science and the stem cell research that can treat and cure disease and save millions of lives. It is a choice between holding secret meetings with polluters in the White House to rewrite our environmental laws – or protecting the air our children breathe and the water they drink.', ""It is a choice between siding with big oil and making America independent of Mideast oil. When we only have 3 percent of the world's oil reserves and we depend on foreign nations for 61 percent of what we consume, we can't drill our way out of an energy crisis. We have to invent our way out of it."", 'John Edwards and I have a plan to invest in new technologies, alternative fuels, and the vehicles of the future so we can achieve energy independence of Middle East oil in ten years. This is our choice: We want an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation, not the Saudi Royal family.', ""I have spoken often in this campaign about national security – about rebuilding and leading strong alliances to find and get the terrorists before they get us. I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as President. But I also know that we can't be strong abroad unless we're strong at home."", 'And that depends not only on new policies – as important as they are – but on the most basic choice we will make this year about what kind of country we are. We have to decide between a leadership that seeks to divide us and a leadership that brings people together. It is a choice between a White House that only talks with those it agrees with...that sees us only as red states and blue states and a leadership that honors the rich diversity of all of our people and sees us as One America – red, white and blue.', 'When Abraham Lincoln was here at Cooper Union in 1860 to decry the continued spread of slavery, he spoke in tones of strength and humility.

A president who puts the middle class first puts their values first: hard work, respect for the truth and a commitment to what is right for Americans.', ""That is the kind of President I intend to be. And that is what I have fought for all my public life. As a prosecutor, I fought for victim's rights. As a Senator, I was a leader in the fight to put 100,000 new police on our streets. I broke with many in my own party to support a balanced budget. I stood with John McCain to find out the truth about what happened to our POWs and MIAs in Vietnam."", ""And I've always stood up for our veterans who stood on the frontlines for us. I am proud that I wrote the legislation that finally provided help and health care to the victims of Agent Orange."", 'I am also proud of the role I played in the landmark law that provides health care to the children of working families.', ""So, if people want to know the real choice in this election, just look at the record. For more than 20 years, I've fought for the middle class and those struggling to join it. But time after time, President Bush has sided with the narrow interests of the few."", ""Next week at Madison Square Garden, the Republican convention will focus on slogans, excuses, and attack politics. And mark my words, they'll bend over backwards with last minute proposals and last minute promises to make up for all they haven't done and to pretend they're not who they are. In fact, pretending to be something they're not may be the single most consistent thing about them, because that's what they've been doing all along."", ""But the American people want truthful answers and real plans. They want leadership that will really put the middle class first. And that's why this is the most important election of our lifetime."", 'America must do better and we will.', ""My fellow citizens, we're the optimists. We're the can do people.

Some people want to take credit for the faith-based service that you've been doing for years. They want to turn it into a political issue.

And on this eve of the third anniversary of September the 11th, 2001, I want to offer a special thanks to Rev. Shaw and the entire membership of the National Baptist Convention for your amazing deeds in the aftermath of that tragedy.

A moment when we finally acknowledged God's truth that we are each made in His image and likeness – that separate but equal is not just unequal – but immoral."", 'I will never forget the lessons I learned from the Reverend John Walker, the first African-American teacher at my high school. He taught me that the real gift of the civil rights movement was not progress for African Americans because of the benevolence of white Americans, but progress for all Americans because of the courageous efforts of a multi-racial coalition of conscience -- led by Black ministers and white ministers, young and old, South and North -- countless unsung heroes determined to bring about a better day.', ""In the hardest passages of the long march for civil rights -- amid lynchings and beatings and unyielding discrimination, the stalwart foot soldiers of justice did not look around and say, as we have heard so often from Washington these days, that we've turned the corner or that the job was getting done or that this was the best that we could do. Like us, they were a generation of optimists. They believed that America's best days lay ahead...that America could always do better. Against all odds, they saw a new dawn of liberty. They had a dream of a more perfect union – a dream of one America."", 'But that dream – our dream – is dim and denied in the Washington of today. 140 years after President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, it is time to again emancipate this land, to live up to our ideals; it is time for a new moment of conscience in America.', 'The fact is, the wrong choices of the Bush Administration – reduced taxes for the few and reduced opportunities for the middle class and those struggling to join it – are taking us back to two Americas -- separate and unequal.

But to keep the faith, we also have to set a new direction for America's leadership in the world. The U.S. and the UN Security Council now face a testing moment of truth – they must decide whether to take action to halt the killing in Darfur or remain idle in the face of the second African genocide in 10 years. If I were president, I would act now. As I've said for months, I would not sit idly by. We simply cannot accept another Rwanda. The United States should ensure the immediate deployment of an effective international force to disarm militia, protect civilians, and facilitate delivery of humanitarian assistance in Darfur. The Sudanese government has thus far rejected such force. The US should lead the United Nations to impose tough sanctions now and make plain, we will not accept Khartoum continuing to block its deployment. And the President should immediately appoint an American Ambassador to the African Union, as we have long had an Ambassador to the European Union. The United States should not treat Africa as a second-class continent."", 'I also know that George Bush has asked the question, ""Does the Democratic Party take African American voters for granted?"" Well, here is my answer. The Book of Matthew reminds us, ""Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep\'s clothing."" [Matthew 7:15]. The president who in the last four years couldn\'t even find time to meet with NAACP... the Black Caucus ... or the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. The president who turns away from African American needs...who scorns economic justice and affirmative action...who traffics in the politics of division – and then claims he is a friend of Black America can not conceal his identity no matter what clothes he wears. And here is the other part of my answer: We will march with you every step of the way to full equality for all Americans. This November we\'re going to have a new march on Washington to bring your voice and our concerns right to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I\'m ready to march with you. Will you march with me?', 'Together, we can close the gaps of inequality that impede the progress of our nation. Together, we can stop being what W.E.B. DuBois called, ""a nation within a nation,"" and what John Edwards and I have called two Americas. Some have questioned this idea. But, Mr. President, I ask you to spend time with struggling families in the hills of Appalachia ... or in public housing in Detroit ... or in the barrios of East LA and then tell me our journey to build one America is finished. Our job, between now and November is to end the division between the fortunate America and the forgotten America. We must come to together to build one America.', ""On issue after issue, the other side has been trying to muddy the waters to keep you from seeing the real differences and the real choices in this election. The Bible tells us that we must sometimes see through a glass darkly. But on every issue, from Iraq to health care, from jobs to education to America's role in the world, the choice is clear. If you believe that this country is heading in the right direction, you should support George Bush. But if you believe a vote for W is a vote for the wrong choices, wrong direction, and the wrong leadership for America, then join with us. If you believe we need good jobs, health care for all, energy independence, and a new direction in Iraq, then I ask you to stand with us for an America that's stronger at home and respected in the world."", ""My friends, this is the most important election of our lifetime. Everything is on the line: our jobs, our health care, our role in the world, the character of our country – the Supreme Court of the United States.

We can't afford to sit this one out or leave it up to our neighbor – and we won't."", 'We have 54 days left until the election. The clock is ticking. Together, we can make the right choices. We can come together. We can fulfill the promise of a better America. There are those who want to divide us into red states and blue states. Not me.

That terrible day has renewed our sense of purpose. And in the years ahead we will share its lessons with our children and grandchildren.

We will tell them that we were strong because we took care of each other – and so can you. We will tell them that we came together in tragedy, chose confidence over fear, and that our love for America far outshone the darkness of those who hate us."", 'Finally, we will tell them that on September 11th and the days that followed, we learned in the hardest way possible that the American spirit endures.

The Sudanese Government has thus far rejected such a force. The U.S. should lead the United Nations to impose tough sanctions now.

On that morning, a man from a tiny town just west of here, reported for work in the World Trade Center. He had just gotten a promotion. He had just married the love of his life.

Do we want four more years of lost jobs and falling wages ... four more years of rising health care costs ... four more years of raiding Social Security to give tax cuts to the wealthy ... four more years of schools being shortchanged, leaving millions of children behind ... four more years of shipping jobs overseas and replacing them with jobs that pay you less ... four more years of a go-it-alone foreign policy. If you do, then you should vote for George W. Bush."", ""But if you want health care for all Americans ... if you want schools that work ... if you want jobs that pay more ... if you want Social Security that's there for the future .... then we need to move America in a new direction with John Edwards and me. And that's the choice in this election."", ""Of all George Bush's wrong choices, the most catastrophic choice is the mess he's made in Iraq. It's not that I would have done one thing differently in Iraq, I would have done almost everything differently. It was wrong to rush to war without a plan to win the peace. It was wrong not to build a strong international coalition of our allies. And it was wrong to put our young men and women into harm's way without a clear mission and the support to get it done."", ""It was wrong for America to go it alone. And now every American is paying the price. Almost all the casualties are the sons and daughters of America. And nearly 90 percent of the cost is coming out of your pocket. The price-tag so far: $200 billion and rising every day. That's $200 billion we're not investing in health care and education. That's $200 billion we're not investing to make sure no child is left behind. That's $200 billion we're not investing in new and better jobs. That's $200 billion we're not investing in homeland security, to protect our airports, our subways, our bridges and tunnels. That's W. Wrong choices, wrong direction, and wrong leadership for America."", ""When it comes to our economy, George W. Bush has made the wrong choices again and again. Over the last three years, we've lost 2.7 million manufacturing jobs here in America. In fact, George Bush is the first president in 72 years -- since the Great Depression -- to actually lose jobs."", ""At that convention last week, the Bush administration said that outsourcing jobs is good for America. That's what they've done for four years and they want to do it for another four. That's W.

Bush has made all the wrong choices. The result is that the members of our greatest generation are still making the greatest sacrifices."", ""On everything from prescription drugs to retirement security to Medicare and Social Security, George W. Bush has made the wrong choices and seniors are paying the price. He's driving them right out of the middle class. So seniors are getting squeezed like never before – but for big drug companies, these truly are the golden years."", ""Just look at George Bush's Medicare drug plan. That plan gives drug companies a $139 billion payoff – instead of making drugs more affordable. That's wrong. It's wrong for him to force seniors into HMO's and to let drug companies set higher prices – instead of trying to get a better deal for our seniors. And it's wrong for him to stop seniors from getting the drugs they need – instead of letting them buy safe, FDA-approved drugs from Canada."", ""That's W. Wrong choices, wrong direction, wrong leadership for America."", 'Once again, this Administration has not been honest with the American people. Today, we found out that they are hiding the truth about your Social Security and Medicare prescription drug benefit. Each year, the Bush Administration has reported to you on how much of your Social Security benefit is eaten up by your Medicare costs. This year, they left that crucial bit of information out.', ""Why? Because they don't want you to know the truth: the Bush Administration has let costs get so high, that you're using more and more of your Social Security to pay for Medicare. Prescription drug costs are way up. Medicare costs are way up. And George Bush hasn't done a thing to stop it. But this shouldn't come as a surprise to any of us."", ""The same Medicare officials who tried to hide the real cost of the failed prescription drug plan are now hiding the skyrocketing costs to you for your health care. That's W. Wrong choices, wrong direction, wrong leadership for America."", ""And with health care costs pushing seniors to the brink, George W. Bush has done nothing to help. Recently, at that convention in New York, the President said he finally had a plan to get costs under control. Now we know what he had in mind. The very next day the Bush administration announced that Medicare premiums will go up 17 percent next year alone – the biggest increase in Medicare premiums in the history of the program. And on George Bush's watch, Medicare premiums have gone up 56 percent."", ""To make matters worse, many seniors are finding that their Social Security checks aren't even getting them through the month. Health care costs are so high, they're cutting right into the cost of living adjustment you get from Social Security. But George W. Bush doesn't just want to eat away at your Social Security paycheck – he wants to privatize the whole program and cut your benefits. When it comes to our seniors, George Bush has a simple four-word answer: slash Social Security first."", ""That's W and that's wrong – wrong choices, wrong direction, wrong leadership for America."", ""John Edwards and I will set a new direction. We'll strengthen Social Security to give you the financial security you've earned. When it comes to health care and Medicare, we're going to put you first. Medicare doesn't belong to the special interests, it belongs to you. You paid for it."", ""And John Edwards and I have a plan for a real prescription drug benefit for seniors and to cut the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. We'll make health care more affordable by cutting the waste and greed out of our health care system, by saving the average family up to $1,000 a year on their premiums, and by letting seniors buy safe and affordable drugs from Canada. We believe that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected – it's a right for all Americans."", 'So this election comes down to a fundamental choice: if you believe that this country is heading in the right direction, you should support George Bush.

If you believe we need good jobs, health care for all, energy independence, and a new direction in Iraq, then I ask you to stand with us.', 'We have 49 days until the election. The clock is ticking.

In a few months, Mr. Sheldon may lose his job. This story was hard for Lori to tell, but what she had the courage to say next will stay with me always. With tears in her eyes, she asked, ""You see those two young ladies over there? Those are my daughters. I\'m tired of saying no to them. We say no all the time.""', ""That's what this election is really about. I want an America where Lori Sheldon and parents like her can start saying yes to her children. An America where people are optimistic about their future, and believe, as we always have, that next generation will do better than that the last. That's what this country has always been built on."", ""And after four years of hearing no from this President – no, it's not our fault; no, there's nothing wrong; no, we can't do better; no, we haven't made a single mistake – it's time for a president who will start saying yes. Yes to good jobs with higher wages; yes to affordable health care and middle-class tax cuts; yes to a government that lives within a budget and businesses that can out-compete anyone in the world."", ""Today, I'm here to tell you we can do this with an economic plan based on a simple principle: a stronger America means a growing middle-class where every American has the chance to work and the opportunity to get ahead."", 'And let me be clear: our plan is pro-worker and pro-business. I\'m an entrepreneurial Democrat, and I don\'t believe you can love jobs but bash the people who create them. I chaired the Small Business Committee for years and I started my own small business. I know that the private sector will always be the engine of good jobs and new ideas. And I also know that the right economic policy can create the conditions for new businesses to grow and succeed. It can also help more businesses say ""yes"" to investing more in America and ""yes"" to lifting up middle-class families with good jobs that pay good wages.', ""The middle class is the moral and economic backbone of this nation. But for four years, the Bush Administration hasn't honored that truth, and it certainly hasn't lived up to it."", ""George Bush's record speaks for itself. 1.6 million lost jobs. The first president in 72 years to actually lose jobs on his watch. 8 million Americans are now looking for work. 45 million have no health insurance – 5 million more than the day he took office. 4.3 million Americans have slipped into poverty over the last four years – 1.3 million are children. The average family saw their income fall $1,500, while they saw the cost of health care, child care, gasoline, and tuition rise faster than ever before. 220,000 more Americans did not attend college last year for the simple reason that they could not afford it. This President turned a $5.6 trillion surplus into trillions of debt for our children. George Bush accomplished all this in only four years. Imagine what he could do in another four. I want to be clear: I'm not saying that president wanted these consequences. But I am saying that by his judgments, by his priorities, he has caused these things to happen. And he can't see the error of his ways."", 'At that convention in New York the other week, President Bush talked about his ownership society. Well Mr. President, when it comes to your record, we agree – you own it.', ""Of course, the President would have us believe that his record is the result of bad luck, not bad decisions. That he's faced the wrong circumstances, not made the wrong choices. In fact, this President has created more excuses than jobs. His is the Excuse Presidency: Never wrong, Never Responsible, Never to Blame. President Bush's desk isn't where the buck stops – it's where the blame begins. He's blamed just about everyone but himself and his administration for America's economic problems. And if he's missed you, don't worry – he's still got 48 days left until the election."", 'He sure has a lot of excuses, but you know what? Of the last eleven presidents – many who faced war and recession – George Bush is the only one to actually lose jobs on his watch.', 'We know the truth. George Bush\'s failed record is the result of George Bush\'s failed policies. And he chose time and again to do nothing to improve our economy or ease the burden on middle class families. In fact, nearly every choice has made it worse. You can even say that George Bush is proud of the fact that not even failure can cause him to change his mind. This is the man who promised his tax cuts would create 6 million new jobs. Today, three tax cuts later, we\'ve lost a million -- seven million jobs short of his prediction. To George Bush, stubborn leadership is steady leadership. But as far as I\'m concerned, George Bush\'s failures are the result of misplaced values and wrong choices that always give more and more to those with the most and tells the middle-class ""you are not the priority.""', 'President Bush inherited record employment, record homeownership, record surpluses; an America of higher incomes, less poverty, and more families with health care.', ""And when the economy faced some rough waters, and we could have put tax cuts into the pockets of families most likely to need the money and spend it, George Bush chose massive tax giveaways for the wealthiest individuals that blew the surplus and did next to nothing to get our economy moving. If anything helped ease the recession, it was the strong income growth of the 90s and historic rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, not George Bush's unaffordable tax cuts. They were the wrong choices, and middle-class families paid the price."", ""When Republican and Democratic governors all across the country were asking Washington for help so that they didn't have to raise tuition, raise local taxes, take cops off the street, and shut down our schools, George Bush chose more deficits and more tax giveaways to the wealthy instead. That was the wrong choice, and middle-class families paid the price."", 'When George Bush saw job after job being shipped overseas, he chose to sit back and protect the tax cuts that rewarded companies who were doing so.', 'When China and Japan were manipulating their currency and violating our trade agreements, and he saw America lose 2.7 million manufacturing jobs, George Bush chose to say and do nothing for workers in Michigan and Ohio and all over the country.', 'When he saw the cost of energy rising, he chose secret meetings the oil industry and special friendships with the Saudis over an energy independent America.', 'And when he saw millions lose their health care and millions more struggling with record premiums, he chose a $139 billion giveaway to the drug companies instead.', 'He chose and he chose and he chose and every single time it was middle-class Americans who paid the price.', ""If you like that choice, then you're in luck, because George Bush and Dick Cheney are promising four more years of the same. Four more years of the same choices from an administration that says we should celebrate an economy of job loss, says that incentives for outsourcing is good for America, and even tells us that this is the best economy of our lifetime."", ""John Edwards and I believe that the measure of a strong economy is a growing middle-class where everyone has the chance to work hard and get ahead. And that's why we are determined to set a new direction for America."", ""Our opponents see an America where power and wealth stay in the hands of a few at the top, while everyone else is left to fend for themselves. We believe in an America where we widen the circle of opportunity for every American. An America where anyone with a good idea who's willing to work hard and take a risk can start a business and build success."", 'Our opponents see an America where more of the tax burden is paid by those who work the hardest and not those who have the most – where a fireman who works overtime to save lives pays higher tax rates than a billionaire who just inherited a fortune. We believe in an America that rewards work with lower taxes and higher incomes.', 'Our opponents see an America where the powerful and well-connected are the first priority. We believe in an America where the first priority is the great middle-class and those struggling to join it – to be able to save money, create wealth, create the businesses of tomorrow. We want all Americans to have the chance to be millionaires and billionaires.', ""These are our values and these are the principles of our economic plan for a stronger America. It's a plan that creates good jobs here in America; a plan that gives relief to middle-class families struggling to pay the bills; and a plan that puts our fiscal house in order and makes our economy more competitive so that we can invest in the high-wage, middle-class jobs of tomorrow."", ""First, we will create good-paying, middle-class jobs right here in America. Today, if a company is torn between creating jobs in Michigan or Malaysia, we now have a tax code that encourages you to go overseas. George Bush thinks that's right. I believe it's wrong. And as President, I will end it."", ""I will close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas. Instead, we're going to use that revenue to reward companies that create and keep good jobs here in the United States of America. Under my plan, we'll cut the corporate tax rate by five percent, giving 99 percent of businesses a tax break."", 'We value an America that exports products, not jobs – and we believe American workers should never have to subsidize the loss of their own job.', 'To the small businesses and manufacturers who decide to add more employees to the payroll, we will provide a New Jobs Tax Credit for every person you hire. And to those small business owners who want to hire more employees but cannot afford to insure them, we will give you up to a 50% tax cut on your health care contributions when you cover your workers.', ""And finally, we will show that a smart trade policy can both open markets and stand up for American workers. We will never succeed in the global economy if we don't open markets and compete in the world. But we'll never get ahead if other countries aren't living up to their part of the bargain. This Administration hasn't enforced our trade deals – I will, because if you give the American worker a fair playing field to compete on, there's nobody in the world the American worker can't compete against."", 'Second, we will make sure that we reward the hard work of our middle-class families by cutting their taxes and lowering their health care costs -- so they can raise the quality of their lives and get our economy moving.', ""So to help them cover the rising costs of child care, we'll offer a tax credit of $1,000. To give more young Americans the chance to go to college, we'll offer a tax break on up to $4,000 in tuition for four years of college. And to help middle-class families pay for health care, we'll offer a health plan that will lower premiums up to $1,000 a year."", ""Spiraling health care costs have been enemy number one for job creation in the United States. They've made our manufacturing sector less competitive and made it that much harder for small businesses to succeed. When the health care costs are so high – up 50 percent in the last four years -- too many businesses have simply decided they can't afford to hire full-time workers with good benefits."", ""My health care plan gets the waste and the greed out of the system to bring down the cost of health care and make your businesses more competitive. We're going to make you the following deal: if you have a health wellness program, we'll pay for 75 percent of your catastrophic costs. We'll improve technology in the system to bring down premiums. And we'll let you buy into the same health care program that senators and congressmen can."", ""Under our plan, you will get to pick you own doctors – and doctors and patients, not insurance company bureaucrats will make medical decisions. My plan is not a government plan. It's based on incentives and the marketplace."", 'To pay for all this, we make sure that 98 percent of all Americans get a tax cut, while rolling back only the tax cuts for those who make more than $200,000 a year. Those Americans will go back to paying the same taxes you paid when Bill Clinton was president. And the rest of America will get a tax cut.', ""Third, we'll restore America's competitive edge to lift up our economy and invest in the middle-class jobs of tomorrow."", ""Never has American competitiveness fallen so far and so fast as it has under George W. Bush. We have a $500 billion trade deficit, and we're borrowing money from the same countries we're competing with for good jobs. Our plan stands up for American companies and American workers by lowering the cost of doing business."", ""But if we want America to thrive in the long run, we must invest more in our people and their ideas so that we can create high-tech, high-wage jobs in industries that are already improving the quality of our lives. We will push the boundaries of science, and never let ideology get in the way of life-saving research or cutting-edge technology. We will offer tax credits to help us seize the possibilities of the Broadband Revolution and make Internet access available to all of America's families. And we will offer tax credits to buy and produce the fuel-efficient cars of the future."", ""Here in Detroit, you know what we're talking about. We have the opportunity to build these cars right here. And for our energy future, I'd rather depend on your innovation and the ingenuity of America's workers than on the Saudi Royal family. So when I am President, you will have a partner and a champion in your fight to create the cutting-edge manufacturing jobs of the future."", ""And we will give our workers the education and the job training that the jobs of tomorrow require today. We'll encourage more young women and minorities to enter the fields of math and science so we can close that gap and compete with the rest of the world. And we'll make lifelong learning a reality so that workers can learn new skills for the new jobs of tomorrow."", ""Finally, our plan is paid for while cutting the deficit in half, because we believe it's time for Washington to live within a budget just like you do."", ""Four years ago, America's fiscal discipline was the envy of the world. Today, we have to go hat in hand to countries like China and Japan to borrow money because George Bush chose to pass and propose trillions of dollars in spending without paying for a dime of it. Now, his election year promises will add $3 trillion to the already record-breaking deficits he created on his watch. $3 trillion of taxpayer money. This president has added more to the deficit than every president from George Washington to Ronald Reagan combined."", 'When you are running the type of massive deficits that they are, Bob Rubin and other experts will tell you that you are jeopardizing job creation and putting the stability of our economic future at risk.', ""Our plan will cut the deficit in half in four years by ending tax giveaways that are nothing more than corporate welfare. We will make government go back to a simple rule: pay as you go. We will cut the waste from our government – cutting 100,000 contractors we don't need, cutting more bureaucrats that have been added over the last four years, and cutting government agencies that have outlived their purposes. And we will impose caps so that spending doesn't go faster than inflation."", ""I will hold my own priorities to the same standard, because I have always believed that fiscal discipline leads to a strong economic future. That's why when I first came to the Senate, I broke with my own party to support a balanced budget plan, which President Ronald Reagan signed into law."", 'Since this campaign began, so many Americans have come up to me and said, this is the most important election of our lifetime. If there were ever any doubt that this is true, you only need to look around our country and see for yourself what the last four years have done to middle-class America.', ""Right now, another factory worker just suffered the indignity of having lifelong loyalty rewarded with a pink slip and a final paycheck that won't cover his family's rent. Right now, another young woman is watching her friends begin the college year without her because she couldn't afford to go. Right now, another boarded-up business is leaving for China, and leaving a community of devastated families behind. And right now, Lori Sheldon is wondering when she'll be able to start saying yes to her daughters."", ""Everyone in this room and everyone in this country has an interest in building that kind of America. As Henry Ford understood, those who run companies can't prosper unless we raise the incomes and the standard of living for the great middle-class."", ""We can do this. We can have an America where that factory worker goes back to school and will learn the new skills to build the cars of the future right here in Detroit. We can have an America where that young woman's family can afford to send her to college, keep their health care, and have a little left over at the end of the month. We can have an America where big ideas and bold entrepreneurs fill that community with new jobs and new hope for better days ahead."", ""That's what America was built on – from Ford Motors and the first Model T to IBM and the first computer. We are a country of innovators and optimists. There are possibilities waiting for us and ideas yet to be imagined -- but only if we make the right choices today. This is our challenge. And it's what this race is all about."", 'Thank you, God Bless you, and God Bless America.']",0
15,            John F. Kerry          ,"September 16, 2004","[""I'm honored to be here today at your 126th Convention. I can't tell you how proud I am to stand before you – and how grateful I am to have the opportunity to talk with you today."", 'I came out here because I wanted to look you in the eye and say thank you. Thank you for your service; thank you for caring; thank you for the sacrifices you and your families make for our country.', ""I come from a state with a great tradition of service and a great understanding of who you are. You can't live in the shadow of Bunker Hill, Lexington Green, the Bridge at Concord, and not know the meaning of Minutemen and citizen service to country."", ""For more than three centuries, as you know better than anyone, our National Guard has stood on the frontlines of freedom. The Guard fought in that first great revolution, and has defended our country ever since, here in America and around the world. Like those who came before you, you joined the Guard because for you, threats to our ideals were a call to action. You joined because for you, sitting on the sidelines in a time of peril simply wasn't an option. And you joined because for you, patriotism isn't just about saying you love your country – it's about living it every single day. Please join me in sending our respect, our admiration, and the thanks of a nation to your brothers and sisters in arms who are standing up for freedom around the world."", 'There\'s something going on right here at home, too. Every time you open the newspaper or turn on the evening news, you read those heartbreaking stories about floods, and fires, and hurricanes – when you see the indelible images of September 11th –the National Guard is there, often risking your lives to save ours. In the past few weeks, thousands of you have been in the eye of the storm, preparing for Hurricane Charlie, Hurricane Frances, and Hurricane Ivan – and afterwards, helping our citizens rebuild their lives. Behind the headlines, through countless acts of courage, honor and quiet sacrifice, all of you keep America safe – reporting for duty on a moment\'s notice: ""Ready, Reliable, Essential and Accessible."" Nothing could make us more proud.', ""The reach of today's Guard is unlike anytime before. In Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Balkans, you have been mobilized in record numbers for extended lengths of time. Gone are the days when you could tell your family that it would be just 6 months, just 9 months, just a year. Today, we've got people doing multiple deployments – serving 18, 20, even 22 months. We've got young kids here at home sending letters to their parents asking: When are you coming home? When will I see you again? And week after week, those mothers and fathers can only write back the same frustrating answer: I just don't know."", ""Last week, we reached a tragic milestone in Iraq: More than 1,000 American servicemen and women have been killed in the line of duty – and more than 100 of them were members of the National Guard. Thousands more have been injured – many of them seriously so. I have visited with some of them in our military hospitals – and let me tell you, I cannot overstate their patriotism, their courageous spirit, and their commitment to our country and to their brothers and sisters still in harm's way. We honor every last one of them for their proud service to our nation, and we pray for their families and loved ones."", ""But honoring your service with our thoughts and prayers is not enough. Especially when right now, in so many ways, we're shortchanging our men and women in the Guard."", 'Those in uniform are duty bound to carry out the orders of the Commander in Chief. And I know that for those of you serving there is a natural affection and a sense of duty. I respect that and it should be that way. But in our democracy, which you defend, it is so important to have a truthful conversation about the choices we face in our nation.', 'Right now, more than 20% of our National Guard and Reserves don\'t have health coverage. And two days ago, our President came before you, and promised that he\'d give you TRICARE for ""up to 90 days before [you] report, and 180 days after de-activation."" That\'s a welcome change in their policy, but frankly, I believe that\'s simply not good enough. I believe we can make better choices. When you sign up for the Guard, you should be eligible for TRICARE every day that you serve – before, during, and after mobilization – end of story.', ""Right now, thousands in the Guard still aren't getting their paychecks on time -- and some don't get them at all. So people are calling home from the frontlines, and instead of talking about how the kids are doing in school, they're talking about how to cut through the red tape, and how to pay the bills. That's wrong, and we have to change it."", ""Right now, too many in the Guard still don't have the body armor, night vision goggles, and radios they need to do their jobs. Too many are using outdated equipment and hand-me-downs from regular forces – and they're wondering if today will be the unlucky day when something just doesn't work. That's wrong, and we have to change it."", ""Right now, those who serve in the Guard can't receive retirement benefits until age 60, and this Administration can't find the funding to lower the age to 55, even while we're spending $200 billion to go it alone in Iraq. That's wrong, and for those who've served in active duty in conflicts aboard, we have to change it."", ""Right now, members of the Guard serving overseas are losing their paychecks here at home, passed over for promotions, and returning to find that the jobs they once held are gone. That's wrong, and we have to change it."", 'Right now, our troops over-stretched and over-extended and the Guard and Reserve have been called on to fill the gap. As President, I pledge to you that I will end the backdoor draft of our National Guard.', ""So today, respectfully, I'd like to ask President Bush a simple question. When our Guardsmen and women are fighting the same war as our active duty troops...when they're facing the same dangers, and coming home in the same wheelchairs, stretchers, and flag-draped coffins...how can we refuse to give them the same resources and respect we give our Regular troops? I believe we can make better choices."", ""The way I see it, this is a matter of values and priorities – and on these issues, President Bush and I couldn't be more different. I believe that America's security begins and ends with our men and women in uniform – with every member of our armed forces who stands guard at the gates of freedom. I will be a President who goes into the Oval Office every morning knowing that it is my job to help you do yours. I will fight for you every day, and I will never let you down. General Clark and I were talking on the way out here about the quality of our armed forces. You are America's finest, the most capable, the most skilled troops in our history, led by the best military leaders in the world. And you deserve no less than the best."", ""And there's something else we owe you and all the men and women serving right now in Iraq. We owe you the truth. True leadership is about looking people in the eye and telling the truth – even when it's hard to hear. And two days ago, President Bush came before you and you received him well, as you should. But I believe he failed the fundamental test of leadership. He failed to tell you the truth. You deserve better. The Commander in Chief must level with the troops and the nation. And as president, I will always be straight with you – on the good days, and the bad days."", ""Two days ago, the President stood right where I'm standing and did not even acknowledge that more than 1,000 men and women have lost their lives in Iraq. He did not tell you that with each passing day, we're seeing more chaos, more violence, more indiscriminate killings. He did not tell you that with each passing week, our enemies are getting bolder – that Pentagon officials report that entire regions of Iraq are now in the hands of terrorists and extremists. He did not tell you that with each passing month, stability and security seem farther and farther away."", 'He did not tell you any of this, even though – as the country learned today in the New York Times – his own intelligence officials have warned him for weeks that the mission in Iraq is in serious trouble. But that is the truth – hard as it is to hear. You deserve a president who will not play politics with national security, who will not ignore his own intelligence, while living in a fantasy world of spin, and who will give the American people the truth about the challenge our brave men and women face on the front lines.', ""The hard truth is that our president has made serious mistakes in taking us to war with Iraq. He was wrong to rush to war without giving the inspectors time to do their job. He was wrong to rush to war without understanding and planning for the post-war in Iraq – which itself has become an ongoing conflict. He was wrong to rush to war without the allies we needed by our side. He was wrong to send our troops into battle without the equipment they need to do their jobs. He was wrong to ignore the best advice of America's own military – including his own Army Chief of Staff – about how many troops we needed to accomplish our mission. So when it comes to Iraq, it's not that I would have done one thing differently than President Bush – I would have done almost everything differently."", 'And today, because of his wrong choices, America has borne nearly 90% of the casualties, and paid nearly 90% of the bill in Iraq. Contrast that with the first Gulf War, where our allies paid 95% of the costs.', 'And perhaps worst of all, the mess in Iraq has set us back – way back – in the war on terror. The simple fact is, when it comes to the war on terror, George W. Bush has taken his eye off the ball.', ""In the months after September 11th, our troops were doing a magnificent job in Afghanistan, and they were hot on the trail of Osama bin Laden. But instead of staying the course and letting them finish the job, George W. Bush turned over critical military operations in Tora Bora to a band of warlords. As a result, Osama bin Laden escaped, and we haven't seen him since."", 'And today, three years after September 11th, Al Qaeda is operating in 60 countries, and gaining a whole new generation of recruits. And again and again, on the evening news, we see videotapes from bin Laden or his top lieutenants. This administration has said bluntly: It is not a matter of if al Qaeda attacks here at home – it is a question of when.', ""I believe America can do better than we're doing. We simply cannot afford four more years of wrong choices that undermine our security and our standing in the world."", ""I also believe that despite the miscalculations, it is not too late to turn things around in Iraq and in our global war on terror. But we need a leadership that sees a better set of choices – better options for getting the job done. Who will bring in our allies. Who will train Iraqi forces at the right pace with the right partners, so our troops can finally come home. Who will never mislead you about the realities you face on the battlefield. And when I'm your Commander-in-Chief, that is exactly what I will do."", 'We all know too well that after September 11th, we face a new and mortal threat. Terrorist groups like al Qaeda and its copycat killers are claiming the right to execute the innocent. They confuse murder with martyrdom and fanaticism with faith. They use terror as a sword and religion as a shield.', 'They present the central national security challenge of our generation. But they are unlike any other adversary our nation has ever confronted. They have no president, capital city, territory, army, or national identity. We are not absolutely certain how they are organized or how many operatives they have. But we know the destruction they can inflict. We saw it at the World Trade Center, at the Pentagon, in a field in rural Pennsylvania. We saw the carnage, the unbearable carnage, in a school in Russia. We have seen it in Indonesia, in Bali and Madrid, in Israel and across the Middle East. And just imagine what the terrorists would do if they got their hands on nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.', ""In this new era, it is imperative that we modernize the world's most powerful military – that we build a 21st century military to meet these 21st century threats. Today, we need a stronger, more modern, better-prepared military to meet the challenges of the post-9/11 world."", ""As President, I will start by expanding America's active duty forces. Today, our armed services are stretched far too thin. Nine out of ten active duty Army divisions are committed to Iraq – either currently there, preparing to go, or recently returned."", ""The war has been especially tough on the Army's critical post-war specialists. Civil affairs. Military police. Combat support units. Psychological operations units. All are in short supply. All are nearly exhausted."", ""And since September 11th, we've called on our National Guard like never before. Today, 40 percent of our forces in Iraq are from the Guard and Reserve. Far too many of you have been on the ground for far too long – much longer than was expected or promised. Far too many of you face additional deployments in the months and years ahead. And a new government report warns that soon, we might not even have enough National Guard and Reserve troops to fight the war on terror."", ""That's why, as President, I will add 40,000 new soldiers to our armed forces -- not to increase the number of soldiers in Iraq, but to help prevent and prepare for other possible conflicts."", 'I will also double our Army Special Forces to hunt down the terrorists. In Afghanistan, after September 11th, our Special Forces fought the Taliban with remarkable skill. We saw what they could do during the Iraq war, when two teams of American Green Berets totaling 31 men worked with Kurdish troops to defeat an Iraqi force numbering in the hundreds. The victory at the battle of Debecka Pass is a tribute to the flexibility, training, and courage of our Special Forces.', ""Of course, the battles of today don't just require more manpower. Today, more than ever before, we are facing new threats which require innovative solutions. And that is the third part of my plan – equipping our military with 21st century technology to defeat 21st century enemies."", ""Nowhere is this more important than when it comes to the threat of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. The stark truth is that today, we've got to be prepared for a worst case scenario in which deadly weapons technology falls into the wrong hands. That's why, as president, I will create new forces that specialize in finding, securing, and destroying weapons of mass destruction and the facilities that build them. Failing to do this simply isn't an option."", ""Finally, if there's one thing we've all learned in the war on terror, it's that, even if we have the troops and technology we need, America can't lead abroad unless we're secure at home. And this Administration has mismanaged a key asset in keeping America safe – our National Guard."", ""The National Guard was intended to complement, not be a substitute for, active duty forces. Many of you are our first responders here at home – fire fighters, police officers, and emergency medical technicians. To take you out of your communities is to take down our critical first line of defense. That's no way to protect America."", ""As President, I will recognize that homeland security is a Constitutionally-mandated mission of the National Guard. In addition to their current duties overseas, I will assign Guard units an additional mission to a standing joint task force, commanded by a General from the Guard. This task force will prepare, and execute, a coordinated strategy for homeland security, working with the states and the federal government to react in times of crisis. While our military can't solve the entire homeland security challenge, the National Guard can make a real difference in protecting America from terrorism."", 'More than 200 years ago, when America was little more than a collection of colonies on the edge of a vast continent, your predecessors resolved to fight for our independence. Many were young – not much older than children. They had nowhere near enough weapons or training or supplies. They were just ordinary citizens coming together to fight for the land they loved. And together, they defeated an empire.', 'Their commitment to freedom shines on in all you do for our country and our world every single day.

As President, I will never forget that our security and our strength begins with you – with a single soldier, standing a single post somewhere in the world. And I will always remain grateful to all of you who do this every day with such grace and such courage.', 'Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.']",0
16,            John F. Kerry          ,"September 20, 2004","['I am honored to be here at New York University -- one of the great urban universities, not just in New York, but in the world. You have set a high standard for global dialogue and I hope to live up to that tradition today.', ""This election is about choices. The most important choices a President makes are about protecting America... at home and around the world. A president's first obligation is to make America safer, stronger and truer to our ideals."", 'Only a few blocks from here, three years ago, the events of September 11 reminded every American of that obligation. That day brought to our shores the defining struggle of our times: the struggle between freedom and radical fundamentalism. And it made clear that our most important task is to fight... and to win... the war on terrorism.', 'With us today is a remarkable group of women who lost loved ones on September 11th ... and whose support I am honored to have. Not only did they suffer an unbearable loss – they helped us learn the lessons of that terrible time by insisting on the creation of the 9/11 Commission. I ask them to stand. And I thank them on behalf of our country -- and I pledge to them and to you that I will implement the 9-11 recommendations.', ""In fighting the war on terrorism, my principles are straightforward. The terrorists are beyond reason. We must destroy them. As president, I will do whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat our enemies. But billions of people around the world yearning for a better life are open to America's ideals. We must reach them."", 'To win, America must be strong. And America must be smart. The greatest threat we face is the possibility Al Qaeda or other terrorists will get their hands on a nuclear weapon.', ""To prevent that from happening, we must call on the totality of America's strength. Strong alliances, to help us stop the world's most lethal weapons from falling into the most dangerous hands. A powerful military, transformed to meet the new threats of terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction. And all of America's power – our diplomacy, our intelligence system, our economic power, the appeal of our values – each of which is critical to making America more secure and preventing a new generation of terrorists from emerging."", 'National security is a central issue in this campaign. We owe it to the American people to have a real debate about the choices President Bush has made... and the choices I would make... to fight and win the war on terror.', 'That means we must have a great honest national debate on Iraq. The President claims it is the centerpiece of his war on terror. In fact, Iraq was a profound diversion from that war and the battle against our greatest enemy, Osama bin Laden and the terrorists. Invading Iraq has created a crisis of historic proportions and, if we do not change course, there is the prospect of a war with no end in sight.', ""This month, we passed a cruel milestone: more than 1,000 Americans lost in Iraq. Their sacrifice reminds us that Iraq remains, overwhelmingly, an American burden. Nearly 90 percent of the troops – and nearly 90 percent of the casualties – are American. Despite the President's claims, this is not a grand coalition."", 'Our troops have served with extraordinary bravery, skill and resolve. Their service humbles all of us. When I speak to them... when I look into the eyes of their families, I know this: we owe them the truth about what we have asked them to do... and what is still to be done.', 'In June, the President declared, ""The Iraqi people have their country back."" Just last week, he told us: ""This country is headed toward democracy... Freedom is on the march.""', ""But the administration's own official intelligence estimate, given to the President last July, tells a very different story."", 'According to press reports, the intelligence estimate totally contradicts what the President is saying to the American people.', 'So do the facts on the ground.', 'Security is deteriorating, for us and for the Iraqis.', '42 Americans died in Iraq in June -- the month before the handover. But 54 died in July...66 in August... and already 54 halfway through September.', 'And more than 1,100 Americans were wounded in August – more than in any other month since the invasion.', 'We are fighting a growing insurgency in an ever widening war-zone. In March, insurgents attacked our forces 700 times. In August, they attacked 2,700 times – a 400% increase.', 'Falluja...Ramadi... Samarra ... even parts of Baghdad – are now ""no go zones""... breeding grounds for terrorists who are free to plot and launch attacks against our soldiers. The radical Shi\'a cleric, Moktada al-Sadr, who\'s accused of complicity in the murder of Americans, holds more sway in the suburbs of Baghdad.', 'Violence against Iraqis... from bombings to kidnappings to intimidation ... is on the rise.', 'Basic living conditions are also deteriorating.', 'Residents of Baghdad are suffering electricity blackouts lasting up to 14 hours a day.', 'Raw sewage fills the streets, rising above the hubcaps of our Humvees. Children wade through garbage on their way to school.', 'Unemployment is over 50 percent. Insurgents are able to find plenty of people willing to take $150 for tossing grenades at passing U.S. convoys.', 'Yes, there has been some progress, thanks to the extraordinary efforts of our soldiers and civilians in Iraq. Schools, shops and hospitals have been opened. In parts of Iraq, normalcy actually prevails.', ""But most Iraqis have lost faith in our ability to deliver meaningful improvements to their lives. So they're sitting on the fence... instead of siding with us against the insurgents."", 'That is the truth. The truth that the Commander in Chief owes to our troops and the American people.', ""It is never easy to discuss what has gone wrong while our troops are in constant danger. But it's essential if we want to correct our course and do what's right for our troops instead of repeating the same mistakes over and over again."", 'I know this dilemma first-hand. After serving in war, I returned home to offer my own personal voice of dissent. I did so because I believed strongly that we owed it those risking their lives to speak truth to power. We still do.', 'Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator who deserves his own special place in hell. But that was not, in itself, a reason to go to war. The satisfaction we take in his downfall does not hide this fact: we have traded a dictator for a chaos that has left America less secure.', 'The President has said that he ""miscalculated"" in Iraq and that it was a ""catastrophic success."" In fact, the President has made a series of catastrophic decisions ... from the beginning ... in Iraq. At every fork in the road, he has taken the wrong turn and led us in the wrong direction.', ""The first and most fundamental mistake was the President's failure to tell the truth to the American people."", 'He failed to tell the truth about the rationale for going to war. And he failed to tell the truth about the burden this war would impose on our soldiers and our citizens.', 'By one count, the President offered 23 different rationales for this war. If his purpose was to confuse and mislead the American people, he succeeded.', ""His two main rationales – weapons of mass destruction and the Al Qaeda/September 11 connection – have been proved false... by the President's own weapons inspectors... and by the 9/11 Commission. Just last week, Secretary of State Powell acknowledged the facts. Only Vice President Cheney still insists that the earth is flat."", 'The President also failed to level with the American people about what it would take to prevail in Iraq.', ""He didn't tell us that well over 100,000 troops would be needed, for years, not months. He didn't tell us that he wouldn't take the time to assemble a broad and strong coalition of allies. He didn't tell us that the cost would exceed $200 billion. He didn't tell us that even after paying such a heavy price, success was far from assured."", ""And America will pay an even heavier price for the President's lack of candor."", 'At home, the American people are less likely to trust this administration if it needs to summon their support to meet real and pressing threats to our security.', 'Abroad, other countries will be reluctant to follow America when we seek to rally them against a common menace -- as they are today. Our credibility in the world has plummeted.', 'In the dark days of the Cuban Missile Crisis, President Kennedy sent former Secretary of State Dean Acheson to Europe to build support. Acheson explained the situation to French President de Gaulle. Then he offered to show him highly classified satellite photos, as proof. De Gaulle waved the photos away, saying: ""The word of the President of the United States is good enough for me.""', ""How many world leaders have that same trust in America's president, today?"", ""This President's failure to tell the truth to us before the war has been exceeded by fundamental errors of judgment during and after the war."", 'The President now admits to ""miscalculations"" in Iraq.', 'That is one of the greatest understatements in recent American history. His were not the equivalent of accounting errors. They were colossal failures of judgment – and judgment is what we look for in a president.', ""This is all the more stunning because we're not talking about 20/20 hindsight. Before the war, before he chose to go to war, bi-partisan Congressional hearings... major outside studies... and even some in the administration itself... predicted virtually every problem we now face in Iraq."", 'This President was in denial. He hitched his wagon to the ideologues who surround him, filtering out those who disagreed, including leaders of his own party and the uniformed military. The result is a long litany of misjudgments with terrible consequences.', ""The administration told us we'd be greeted as liberators. They were wrong."", ""They told us not to worry about looting or the sorry state of Iraq's infrastructure. They were wrong."", 'They told us we had enough troops to provide security and stability, defeat the insurgents, guard the borders and secure the arms depots. They were wrong.', 'They told us we could rely on exiles like Ahmed Chalabi to build political legitimacy. They were wrong.', 'They told us we would quickly restore an Iraqi civil service to run the country and a police force and army to secure it. They were wrong.', 'In Iraq, this administration has consistently over-promised and under-performed. This policy has been plagued by a lack of planning, an absence of candor, arrogance and outright incompetence. And the President has held no one accountable, including himself.', 'In fact, the only officials who lost their jobs over Iraq were the ones who told the truth.', ""General Shinseki said it would take several hundred thousand troops to secure Iraq. He was retired. Economic adviser Larry Lindsey said that Iraq would cost as much as $200 billion. He was fired. After the successful entry into Baghdad, George Bush was offered help from the UN -- and he rejected it. He even prohibited any nation from participating in reconstruction efforts that wasn't part of the original coalition – pushing reluctant countries even farther away. As we continue to fight this war almost alone, it is hard to estimate how costly that arrogant decision was. Can anyone seriously say this President has handled Iraq in a way that makes us stronger in the war on terrorism?"", 'By any measure, the answer is no. Nuclear dangers have mounted across the globe. The international terrorist club has expanded. Radicalism in the Middle East is on the rise. We have divided our friends and united our enemies. And our standing in the world is at an all time low.', 'Think about it for a minute. Consider where we were... and where we are. After the events of September 11, we had an opportunity to bring our country and the world together in the struggle against the terrorists. On September 12th, headlines in newspapers abroad declared ""we are all Americans now."" But through his policy in Iraq, the President squandered that moment and rather than isolating the terrorists, left America isolated from the world.', 'We now know that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction and posed no imminent threat to our security. It had not, as the Vice President claimed, ""reconstituted nuclear weapons.""', ""The President's policy in Iraq took our attention and resources away from other, more serious threats to America."", ""Threats like North Korea, which actually has weapons of mass destruction, including a nuclear arsenal, and is building more under this President's watch..."", '... The emerging nuclear danger from Iran...', '... The tons and kilotons of unsecured chemical and nuclear weapons in Russia...', '... And the increasing instability in Afghanistan.', 'Today, warlords again control much of that country, the Taliban is regrouping, opium production is at an all time high and the Al Qaeda leadership still plots and plans, not only there but in 60 other nations. Instead of using U.S. forces, we relied on the warlords to capture Osama bin Laden when he was cornered in the mountains. He slipped away. We then diverted our focus and forces from the hunt for those responsible for September 11th in order to invade Iraq.', 'We know Iraq played no part in September 11 and had no operational ties to Al Qaeda.', ""The President's policy in Iraq precipitated the very problem he said he was trying to prevent. Secretary of State Powell admits that Iraq was not a magnet for international terrorists before the war. Now it is, and they are operating against our troops. Iraq is becoming a sanctuary for a new generation of terrorists who someday could hit the United States."", 'We know that while Iraq was a source of friction, it was not previously a source of serious disagreement with our allies in Europe and countries in the Muslim world.', ""The President's policy in Iraq divided our oldest alliance and sent our standing in the Muslim world into free fall. Three years after 9/11, even in many moderate Muslim countries like Jordan, Morocco and Turkey, Osama bin Laden is more popular than the United States of America."", ""Let me put it plainly: The President's policy in Iraq has not strengthened our national security. It has weakened it."", 'Two years ago, Congress was right to give the President the authority to use force to hold Saddam Hussein accountable. This President... any President... would have needed the threat of force to act effectively. This President misused that authority.', 'The power entrusted to the President gave him a strong hand to play in the international community. The idea was simple. We would get the weapons inspectors back in to verify whether or not Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. And we would convince the world to speak with one voice to Saddam: disarm or be disarmed.', 'A month before the war, President Bush told the nation: ""If we have to act, we will take every precaution that is possible. We will plan carefully. We will act with the full power of the United States military. We will act with allies at our side and we will prevail."" He said that military action wasn\'t ""unavoidable.""', 'Instead, the President rushed to war without letting the weapons inspectors finish their work. He went without a broad and deep coalition of allies. He acted without making sure our troops had enough body armor. And he plunged ahead without understanding or preparing for the consequences of the post-war. None of which I would have done.', ""Yet today, President Bush tells us that he would do everything all over again, the same way. How can he possibly be serious? Is he really saying that if we knew there were no imminent threat, no weapons of mass destruction, no ties to Al Qaeda, the United States should have invaded Iraq? My answer is no – because a Commander-in-Chief's first responsibility is to make a wise and responsible decision to keep America safe."", 'Now the president, in looking for a new reason, tries to hang his hat on the ""capability"" to acquire weapons. But that was not the reason given to the nation; it was not the reason Congress voted on; it\'s not a reason, it\'s an excuse. Thirty-five to forty countries have greater capability to build a nuclear bomb than Iraq did in 2003. Is President Bush saying we should invade them?', 'I would have concentrated our power and resources on defeating global terrorism and capturing or killing Osama bin Laden. I would have tightened the noose and continued to pressure and isolate Saddam Hussein – who was weak and getting weaker -- so that he would pose no threat to the region or America.', ""The President's insistence that he would do the same thing all over again in Iraq is a clear warning for the future. And it makes the choice in this election clear: more of the same with President Bush or a new direction that makes our troops and America safer. It is time, at long last, to ask the questions and insist on the answers from the Commander-in-Chief about his serious misjudgments and what they tell us about his administration and the President himself. If George W. Bush is re-elected, he will cling to the same failed policies in Iraq -- and he will repeat, somewhere else, the same reckless mistakes that have made America less secure than we can or should be."", ""In Iraq, we have a mess on our hands. But we cannot throw up our hands. We cannot afford to see Iraq become a permanent source of terror that will endanger America's security for years to come."", 'All across this country people ask me what we should do now. Every step of the way, from the time I first spoke about this in the Senate, I have set out specific recommendations about how we should and should not proceed. But over and over, when this administration has been presented with a reasonable alternative, they have rejected it and gone their own way. This is stubborn incompetence.', 'Five months ago, in Fulton, Missouri, I said that the President was close to his last chance to get it right. Every day, this President makes it more difficult to deal with Iraq – harder than it was five months ago, harder than it was a year ago. It is time to recognize what is – and what is not – happening in Iraq today. And we must act with urgency.', 'Just this weekend, a leading Republican, Chuck Hagel, said we\'re ""in deep trouble in Iraq ... it doesn\'t add up ... to a pretty picture [and] ... we\'re going to have to look at a recalibration of our policy."" Republican leaders like Dick Lugar and John McCain have offered similar assessments.', 'We need to turn the page and make a fresh start in Iraq.', ""First, the President has to get the promised international support so our men and women in uniform don't have to go it alone. It is late; the President must respond by moving this week to gain and regain international support."", 'Last spring, after too many months of resistance and delay, the President finally went back to the U.N. which passed Resolution 1546. It was the right thing to do – but it was late.', ""That resolution calls on U.N. members to help in Iraq by providing troops... trainers for Iraq's security forces... a special brigade to protect the U.N. mission... more financial assistance... and real debt relief."", ""Three months later, not a single country has answered that call. And the president acts as if it doesn't matter."", 'And of the $13 billion previously pledged to Iraq by other countries, only $1.2 billion has been delivered.', ""The President should convene a summit meeting of the world's major powers and Iraq's neighbors, this week, in New York, where many leaders will attend the U.N. General Assembly. He should insist that they make good on that U.N. resolution. He should offer potential troop contributors specific, but critical roles, in training Iraqi security personnel and securing Iraq's borders. He should give other countries a stake in Iraq's future by encouraging them to help develop Iraq's oil resources and by letting them bid on contracts instead of locking them out of the reconstruction process."", 'This will be difficult. I and others have repeatedly recommended this from the very beginning. Delay has made only made it harder. After insulting allies and shredding alliances, this President may not have the trust and confidence to bring others to our side in Iraq. But we cannot hope to succeed unless we rebuild and lead strong alliances so that other nations share the burden with us. That is the only way to succeed.', 'Second, the President must get serious about training Iraqi security forces.', 'Last February, Secretary Rumsfeld claimed that more than 210,000 Iraqis were in uniform. Two weeks ago, he admitted that claim was exaggerated by more than 50 percent. Iraq, he said, now has 95,000 trained security forces.', ""But guess what? Neither number bears any relationship to the truth. For example, just 5,000 Iraqi soldiers have been fully trained, by the administration's own minimal standards. And of the 35,000 police now in uniform, not one has completed a 24-week field-training program. Is it any wonder that Iraqi security forces can't stop the insurgency or provide basic law and order?"", 'The President should urgently expand the security forces training program inside and outside Iraq. He should strengthen the vetting of recruits, double classroom training time, and require follow-on field training. He should recruit thousands of qualified trainers from our allies, especially those who have no troops in Iraq. He should press our NATO allies to open training centers in their countries. And he should stop misleading the American people with phony, inflated numbers.', 'Third, the President must carry out a reconstruction plan that finally brings tangible benefits to the Iraqi people.', 'Last week, the administration admitted that its plan was a failure when it asked Congress for permission to radically revise spending priorities in Iraq. It took 17 months for them to understand that security is a priority ... 17 months to figure out that boosting oil production is critical ... 17 months to conclude that an Iraqi with a job is less likely to shoot at our soldiers.', ""One year ago, the administration asked for and received $18 billion to help the Iraqis and relieve the conditions that contribute to the insurgency. Today, less than a $1 billion of those funds have actually been spent. I said at the time that we had to rethink our policies and set standards of accountability. Now we're paying the price."", 'Now, the President should look at the whole reconstruction package...draw up a list of high visibility, quick impact projects... and cut through the red tape. He should use more Iraqi contractors and workers, instead of big corporations like Halliburton. He should stop paying companies under investigation for fraud or corruption. And he should fire the civilians in the Pentagon responsible for mismanaging the reconstruction effort.', 'Fourth, the President must take immediate, urgent, essential steps to guarantee the promised elections can be held next year.', 'Credible elections are key to producing an Iraqi government that enjoys the support of the Iraqi people and an assembly to write a Constitution that yields a viable power sharing arrangement.', 'Because Iraqis have no experience holding free and fair elections, the President agreed six months ago that the U.N. must play a central role. Yet today, just four months before Iraqis are supposed to go to the polls, the U.N. Secretary General and administration officials themselves say the elections are in grave doubt. Because the security situation is so bad... and because not a single country has offered troops to protect the U.N. elections mission... the U.N. has less than 25 percent of the staff it needs in Iraq to get the job done.', ""The President should recruit troops from our friends and allies for a U.N. protection force. This won't be easy. But even countries that refused to put boots on the ground in Iraq should still help protect the U.N. We should also intensify the training of Iraqis to manage and guard the polling places that need to be opened. Otherwise, U.S forces would end up bearing those burdens alone."", 'If the President would move in this direction ... if he would bring in more help from other countries to provide resources and forces ... train the Iraqis to provide their own security ...develop a reconstruction plan that brings real benefits to the Iraqi people ... and take the steps necessary to hold credible elections next year ... we could begin to withdraw U.S. forces starting next summer and realistically aim to bring all our troops home within the next four years.', 'This is what has to be done. This is what I would do as President today. But we cannot afford to wait until January. President Bush owes it to the American people to tell the truth and put Iraq on the right track. Even more, he owes it to our troops and their families, whose sacrifice is a testament to the best of America.', ""The principles that should guide American policy in Iraq now and in the future are clear: We must make Iraq the world's responsibility, because the world has a stake in the outcome and others should share the burden. We must effectively train Iraqis, because they should be responsible for their own security. We must move forward with reconstruction, because that's essential to stop the spread of terror. And we must help Iraqis achieve a viable government, because it's up to them to run their own country. That's the right way to get the job done and bring our troops home."", 'On May 1 of last year, President Bush stood in front of a now infamous banner that read ""Mission Accomplished."" He declared to the American people: ""In the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed."" In fact, the worst part of the war was just beginning, with the greatest number of American casualties still to come. The president misled, miscalculated, and mismanaged every aspect of this undertaking and he has made the achievement of our objective – a stable Iraq, secure within its borders, with a representative government, harder to achieve.', ""In Iraq, this administration's record is filled with bad predictions, inaccurate cost estimates, deceptive statements and errors of judgment of historic proportions."", 'At every critical juncture in Iraq, and in the war on terrorism, the President has made the wrong choice. I have a plan to make America stronger.', ""The President often says that in a post 9-11 world, we can't hesitate to act. I agree. But we should not act just for the sake of acting. I believe we have to act wisely and responsibly."", 'George Bush has no strategy for Iraq. I do.', 'George Bush has not told the truth to the American people about why we went to war and how the war is going. I have and I will continue to do so.', 'I believe the invasion of Iraq has made us less secure and weaker in the war against terrorism. I have a plan to fight a smarter, more effective war on terror – and make us safer.', ""Today, because of George Bush's policy in Iraq, the world is a more dangerous place for America and Americans."", 'If you share my conviction that we can not go on as we are ...that we can make America stronger and safer than it is... then November 2 is your chance to speak... and to be heard. It is not a question of staying the course, but of changing the course.', ""I'm convinced that with the right leadership, we can create a fresh start and move more effectively to accomplish our goals. Our troops have served with extraordinary courage and commitment. For their sake, and America's sake, we must get this right. We must do everything in our power to complete the mission and make America stronger at home and respected again in the world."", 'Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.']",0

Like the great Philadelphian Ben Franklin, you have a proud tradition of seeking answers to the defining questions of our time. I hope to follow in that tradition this morning."", 'My fellow Americans, the most urgent national security challenge we face is the war against those who attacked our country on September 11th, the war against Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. As president, I will fight a tougher, smarter, more effective war on terror. My priority will be to find and capture or kill the terrorists before they get us.', 'When we look at the images of children brutalized by remorseless terrorists in Russia, we know that this is not just a political or military struggle – it goes to the very heart of what we value most – our families. It strikes at the bond between a mother and child. As president, I will make it my sacred duty to be able to say to every mother and father in this country, I am doing everything in my power to keep your children safe.', 'We owe the American people a real debate about the choices President Bush has made... and the choices I will make... to fight and win the war against terrorism.', 'President Bush was right to invade Afghanistan and overthrow the Taliban. I supported that decision. So did our country and our allies. So did the world.', 'But since then, again and again, the President has made the wrong choices in the war on terror... around the world and here at home.', 'Instead of using U.S. forces to capture Osama bin Laden... the President outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, who let bin Laden slip away. That was the wrong choice.', 'Instead of finishing the job in Afghanistan... the President rushed to a new war in Iraq. That was the wrong choice.', 'Instead of listening to the uniformed military, his own State Department, Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress, and outside experts about how to win the peace in Iraq... the President hitched his wagon to the ideologues who told him our troops would be welcomed as liberators. That was the wrong choice.', ""Instead of responding to the greatest intelligence failure in our history with a rapid overhaul of our intelligence system ... the President dragged his feet and actually resisted reform. After opposing the 9/11 Commission, after trying to block its extension, after finally agreeing to testify, but only with Vice President Cheney at his side, he still refuses to fully implement the Commission's recommendations. Those were the wrong choices."", 'Instead of proposing a Department of Homeland Security ... the President actually opposed it – and then exploited it for political purposes. That was the wrong choice.', 'Instead of expanding programs to keep weapons of mass destruction in Russia out of terrorist hands... the President first tried to cut the programs... and even after 9/11 did too little to strengthen them. That was the wrong choice.', 'Instead of facing the urgent nuclear dangers in North Korea and Iran... he allowed these dangers to mount on his presidential watch. That was the wrong choice.', 'Instead of speaking forcefully to the Saudis and others about terrorist financing ... the President has said little and done less. That was the wrong choice.', 'Instead of providing our police, firefighters, and ambulance drivers with the equipment they need... instead of protecting ports, trains, subway lines and highways... instead of defending nuclear plants and chemical factories... this President under-funded homeland security. That was the wrong choice.', 'Instead of bringing the world together against the terrorists... the President alienated the countries whose help we need to defeat them. That was the wrong choice.', ""Yet, in the face of all the misjudgments, all the miscalculations, and all the mistakes, the president still says he wouldn't do anything different. I would. I will make very different choices in the war on terrorism. I know what has gone wrong... and what needs to be done."", ""I begin with this belief: The war on terror is as monumental a struggle as the Cold War. Its outcome will determine whether we and our children live in freedom or in fear. It is not, as some people think, a clash of civilizations. Radical Islamic fundamentalism is not the true face of Islam. This is a clash between civilization and the enemies of civilization; between humanity's best hopes and most primitive fears. The danger we face today will become even greater if the terrorists acquire what we know they are seeking – weapons of mass destruction, which they would use to commit mass murder. We are confronting an enemy and an ideology that must be destroyed. We are in a war that must be won."", 'Americans know this. We understand the stakes. On September 11th there were no Democrats, no Republicans. We were only Americans. We all stood together. We all supported the President. We all prayed for victory, because we love our country and despise everything our enemies stand for.', ""But three years after 9/11, we see our enemies striking -- in Spain, in Turkey, in Indonesia, in Kenya, and now every day -- in the most despicable and gruesome ways in Iraq, which was not a terrorist haven before the invasion. In fact, there were more terrorist attacks in the world last year than the year before. And we see an administration in confusion; we hear the president, the commander in chief, proclaiming one day that this war can't be won and then saying something different the next day. And we hear the Secretary of Defense himself wondering whether the radicals are recruiting, training, and deploying more terrorists than we're capturing or killing."", 'Then, yesterday, when asked about conditions in Iraq, Secretary Rumsfeld told Congress, and I quote: ""Let\'s pretend, hypothetically, that you get to election time in January and let\'s pretend that it\'s roughly like it is, or a little worse, which it could be, because you\'ve got to expect it to continue....So be it, nothing is perfect in life."" If there was any doubt that the leaders of the Bush Administration are living in a fantasy world of spin, I think Secretary Rumsfeld put that doubt to rest.', 'We need to end this confusion. We need national leaders who will face reality – not only in Iraq but in the war on terror. And we need a president who has no doubt that the war on terror can and must be won.', ""The invasion of Iraq was a profound diversion from the battle against our greatest enemy – Al Qaeda -- which killed more than three thousand people on 9/11 and which still plots our destruction today. And there's just no question about it: the President's misjudgment, miscalculation and mismanagement of the war in Iraq all make the war on terror harder to win. Iraq is now what it was not before the war – a haven for terrorists. George Bush made Saddam Hussein the priority. I would have made Osama bin Laden the priority. As president, I will finish the job in Iraq and refocus our energies on the real war on terror."", ""I will wage this war relentlessly with a single-minded determination: to capture or kill the terrorists, crush their movement and free the world from fear. To destroy our enemy, we have to know our enemy. We have to understand that we are facing a radical fundamentalist movement with global reach and a very specific plan. They are not just out to kill us for the sake of killing us. They want to provoke a conflict that will radicalize the people of the Muslim world, turning them against the United States and the West. And they hope to transform that anger into a force that will topple the region's governments and pave the way for a new empire, an oppressive, fundamentalist superstate stretching across a vast area from Europe to Africa, from the Middle East to Central Asia."", 'The American people have a right to hear the answer to a fundamental question: How are we going to win this war? What is our strategy for eliminating the terrorists, discrediting their cause, and smashing their forces so that America can actually be safer?', ""Every week too many American families grieve for loved ones killed in Iraq by terrorist forces that weren't even there before the invasion. The jihadist movement that hates us is gaining adherents around the world. An estimated 18,000 al Qaeda trained militants are operating in 60 countries around the world in a dangerous and more elusive network of extremist groups. Al Qaeda shouldn't be hitting us anywhere. They should be losing, everywhere. We should be winning, everywhere."", 'That will take time. It will not be easy. But it can be done. And I have a comprehensive strategy for victory over terrorism.', 'First, I will build a stronger, smarter military and intelligence capability to capture or kill our enemies.', 'As president, I will expand our Army by 40,000 troops so that we have more soldiers to find and fight the enemy. I will double our Army Special Forces capacity. And we will accelerate the development and deployment of new technologies to track down and bring down terrorists.', ""I will strengthen our intelligence system to detect and stop the terrorists before they can strike. By the morning of September 12th, everyone in America knew that our intelligence wasn't as good as it needed to be. But three years later, believe it or not, we read that the CIA unit charged with finding bin Laden has fewer experienced case officers today than it had before 9/11."", 'When I am president, that will change. I will act immediately to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations. I will create a National Intelligence Director with all the budget and personnel authority the Commission says is needed to keep us safe. I will double our overseas clandestine service, train the linguists and Arab experts we need, and make sure the operation – hunting down bin Laden and al Qaeda -- has all the resources it needs.', 'I will make Afghanistan a priority again, because it is still the front line in the war on terror.', 'As president, I will not subcontract the fight to warlords who are out for nothing but power and personal gain. I will help the government of Afghanistan expand its authority beyond Kabul to the rest of the country. I will lead our allies to share the burden, so that NATO finally provides more troops. I will show the world that America finishes what it begins.', 'Second, I will move decisively to deny the terrorists the deadly weapons they seek.', ""Those weapons were not in Iraq. But tons and kilotons of poorly secured chemical and nuclear weapons are spread throughout the former Soviet Union. Twelve years ago, we began a bipartisan program to help these nations secure and destroy those weapons. It is incredible – and unacceptable -- that in the three years after 9/11, President Bush hasn't stepped up our effort to lock down the loose nuclear weapons and materials in the former Soviet Union and elsewhere. More such materials were secured in the two years before 9/11 than in the two years after."", ""When I'm president, denying our most dangerous enemies the world's most dangerous weapons will become the central priority for America."", ""I will secure all nuclear weapons and materials in the former Soviet Union within four years. At President Bush's pace, it will take 13 years."", 'I will seek a verifiable global ban on the production of materials for nuclear weapons.', 'Nowhere is the nuclear danger more urgent than in Iran and North Korea.', 'This week, Iran announced its intention to process enough raw uranium to create five nuclear weapons.', 'I will make it clear to Iran that we will lead an international effort to impose tough sanctions if they do not permanently suspend their uranium enrichment program and provide verifiable assurances that they are not developing nuclear weapons.', 'Yesterday, there were reports that North Korea are preparing to fire an intermediate-range ballistic missile that may be able to carry a nuclear warhead. I will work with our allies to get the six party talks with North Korea back on track -- and I will talk directly with the North Koreans -- to get a verifiable agreement that will eliminate their nuclear weapons program completely and irreversibly. We have to get serious about diplomacy with North Korea now. Only then will we have the support of our allies for action if diplomacy fails.', 'Third, as president, I will wage a war on terrorist finances every bit as total as the war we wage on the terrorists themselves. We will trace terrorist funds to their sources and freeze the assets of anyone -- any person, bank, business or foreign official -- who is financing terrorism. I know how to do this. As Senator, I exposed and helped dismantle an international bank that was one of the early financiers of terrorism. We did it by following the money. We can and must do the same to choke off the dollars that are funding al Qaeda and its allies. On this, I will grant no one a ""free pass.""', 'As president, I will do what President Bush has not: I will hold the Saudis accountable. Since 9/11, there have been no public prosecutions in Saudi Arabia, and few elsewhere, of terrorist financers. I will work with our allies, with the World Bank and international financial institutions to shut down the financial pipeline that keeps terrorism alive. And I will pursue a plan to make this nation energy independent of Mid East oil. I want an America that relies on our own innovation and ingenuity, not the Saudi Royal Family.', 'Fourth, as president, I will make homeland security a real priority by offering a real plan, and backing it with real resources.', 'The first task is to prevent terrorists and their tools of destruction from entering our country.', 'We know that al Qaeda members and other terrorists could cross into America from Mexico and Canada. We are now told that America\'s borders have grown even more porous since September 11. And 9/11 Commission staff report that our border inspectors don\'t even have the ""training"" and ""basic intelligence"" information to keep out terrorists.', ""At our seaports we're physically inspecting only 5% of the cargo coming into America. The Bush Administration is spending more in Iraq in four days than they've spent protecting our ports for all of the last three years."", 'At our airports, there has been some progress, but there is far more to do. According to news accounts, the terrorist aviation list only includes those who are a danger to aviation. This is ridiculous. It should include every suspected terrorist who is a danger to anything, anywhere in our country.', ""Terrorists used explosives to bring down two planes in Russia. Yet here in America, the system for detecting explosives carried by passengers fails to pass our own government's tests. And here's something that makes no sense at all: your luggage is x-rayed when it's put on the plane, but the cargo on the hold underneath seldom is."", ""This has to change. In a Kerry-Edwards Administration, we'll give inspectors at our borders access to the terrorist watch lists. At our ports, we will provide a 600 percent increase in support for the most promising cargo inspection programs. In our airports, we'll install the equipment to check passengers for explosives to screen cargo just like we screen baggage. And across the country, we will make sure our police, firefighters, and ambulance drivers have the latest radios, hazmat suits, decontamination facilities, and emergency operation centers they need to respond effectively in a crisis."", ""This is all common sense; but none of it is a priority for the Bush Administration. Here's what's on their agenda. Costly new nuclear weapons we don't need that risk fueling a new arms race. And committing to a missile defense system that could eventually cost $100 billion doesn't yet work and won't stop likely threats to our security."", 'Near here, in the Philadelphia region, there are eight chemical plants where a terrorist attack could endanger a million people. But this President allowed the chemical industry to derail commonsense measures for chemical plant security. As president, I will protect them.', 'At a time when police officers are more critical than ever to our homeland security, this President gutted the program to put 100,000 new police on our streets. I will restore that funding and make sure the money reaches our first responders.', ""This President has failed to provide even a nickel in his budget to safeguard our railroads and subways – leaving millions of people every day more vulnerable to terrorist attacks. We will invest more than $2 billion in new funding to protect our transit systems, so that what happened in Madrid doesn't happen here."", ""Fifth, as we go after the terrorists and secure our homeland, I will focus on the long-term frontline of this war. To defeat the terrorists' aims, we must deny them recruits and safe havens."", 'For al Qaeda, this war is a struggle for the heart and soul of the Muslim world. We will win this war only if the terrorists lose that struggle. We will win when ordinary people from Nigeria to Egypt to Pakistan to Indonesia know they have more to live for than to die for. We will win when they once again see America as the champion, not the enemy, of their legitimate yearning to live in just and peaceful societies. We will win when we stop isolating ourselves and start isolating our enemies. The world knows the difference between empty promises and genuine commitment.', ""So we will win when we show that America uses its economic power for the common good, doing our share to defeat the abject poverty, hunger, and disease that destroy lives and create failed states in every part of the world. The world's poorest countries, suffering under crushing debt burdens, need particular attention. As president, I will lead the international community to cancel the debt of the most vulnerable nations in return for them living up to goals of social and economic progress."", 'We will win when we work with our allies, to enable children in poor countries to get a quality basic education. More than 50 percent of the population in the Arab and Muslim world is under the age of 25. The future is a race between schools that spark learning and schools that teach hate. We have to preempt the haters. We have to win the war of ideas. New generations must believe there is more to life than salvation through martyrdom.', 'Sixth, we will promote the development of free and democratic societies throughout the Arab and Muslim world. Millions of people there share our values of human rights, and our hopes for a better life for the next generation. They are facing their own struggle at home against the forces of fanaticism and militancy. They are our natural allies. Their lost trust in our intentions must be restored. We must reach out to them and yes we must always promote democracy. I will be clear with repressive governments in the region that we expect to see them change – not just for our sake but for their own survival.', 'As president, I will lead a massive national effort to improve our outreach to the Muslim world. We will train a new generation of American scholars, diplomats, and military officers, who know this region just as we built our knowledge of the Soviet Empire during the Cold War. I will convene a summit with our European partners and leaders from the Muslim world to strengthen mutual understanding, economic growth and the fight against terror.', 'Let it be clear that the issue here is advancing democracy in Arab nations, not yielding to pressure to undermine Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East. Our alliance with Israel – the survival and security of Israel – are non-negotiable. The only solution is a Jewish state of Israel living side by side in security and peace with a democratic Palestinian state.', 'Finally, we will be stronger if we do not go it alone. As president, I will rebuild and lead strong alliances. This is not only critical to our military operations; it is essential to every other measure we must take, from tracking down terrorists, where we need the intelligence cooperation of other nations, to homeland security, where we need their help to stop terrorists and their weapons before they ever reach our shores.', ""We will not succeed in destroying freedom's adversaries if we are divided from freedom's friends. The terrorists certainly understand that. They are making a special effort to set off bombs in Turkey, Morocco and Indonesia. They want to keep other countries from standing with us in the war on terror. They know what the Bush administration has been so reluctant to admit -- that we are weaker when we fight almost alone. We are safer and stronger, in our capacity to capture and kill terrorists when we fight with allies by our side."", ""But the Bush administration would have you believe that when it comes to our allies, it won't make a difference who is president. They say the Europeans won't help us, no matter what. We're not going to get more cooperation in the war on terror, no matter what. Ordinary people around the world will resent us, no matter what. But I have news for President Bush: just because you can't do something, doesn't mean it can't be done."", 'The first President Bush waged the first Gulf War with a real coalition that fought with us on the battlefield and paid virtually the entire cost of that war. President Clinton built a real coalition in Kosovo, and now virtually every soldier on patrol there comes from a foreign country. During the Cold War, every American president understood what is still true today: The strength of our country is vital but so is the character of our country. It is better to be an America that rallies others to our cause than an America that has to go it alone.', 'I believe we can win the war on terror. We can defeat, capture and kill those who commit terror. I have just outlined a strategy for victory.', 'I know this struggle will be waged in many ways and many places. I know that it will be a long and difficult struggle. I know we have to be resolute in confronting the evil that exists in the world. But in the end, one of our greatest strengths, one of our greatest safeguards, is that America can be the ideal that inspires others everywhere. If we again become that beacon of hope, we will discover in ourselves the most powerful and useful weapons in the war against the terrorists. Because if we are true to ourselves, terrorists cannot defeat the values and vision that have made America great.', ""No American mother should have to lie awake at night worrying whether her children will be safe at school the next day. No one should fear visiting our nation's capitol or our greatest cities because they might be attacked."", 'Our hope – our determination – is nothing less than this: to live our lives confident that we are safe at home and secure in our world. And that is the great victory I will fight for as your President.', 'Thank you, God bless you and God bless America.']",0

And I will hunt down, capture and kill the terrorists before they get us.', 'For the next month, I will speak to the America people every single day about the war in Iraq and the war on terror, because, as president, my number one priority will be to protect the American people. There is nothing more important.', ""George Bush made a colossal error of judgment in Iraq. He promised us that the war in Iraq was his last resort. Instead, it was his first option. He promised he'd plan carefully, but instead he rushed to war without a plan to win the peace. He promised us that we'd have our allies on our side. Instead, America's shouldering nearly 90 percent of the coalition casualties and nearly 90 percent of the cost. Today, more than a thousand brave Americans have died in Iraq. And George Bush says that if he had to do it all over again he wouldn't change a thing."", 'The real test of leadership is how you respond if things go wrong. Do you face the facts and fix the problems?

He can't see the problems, so he can't solve them. He confuses staying in place with leadership."", ""But it's not just Iraq. Over the past four years, he has made serious misjudgments here at home. Choices that have hurt middle class families like yours."", ""If you asked President Bush, he'd tell you everything's just fine here at home. That this is the best economy of our lifetime. That this is the best that we can do. Maybe that's true for his friends – for Enron, for Halliburton, for the big oil industry. But that's not true for folks like you that I've met all across America."", 'The other day, after a rally in Ohio, a woman asked someone from our campaign to deliver a message to me.

For the last four years, George Bush has turned his back on you and your families with almost every choice he's made.

And you were able to give your children more opportunity than you had.', ""But today, for too many families, the dream is harder to reach because of decisions made by this administration. Jobs are shipped overseas, and the ones that replace them don't pay enough to make ends meet. Two incomes barely cover the basics. Health care up 50 percent. College tuition up 35 percent. Gas up 30 percent. Personal bankruptcies are at an all-time high. And the typical family is making $1,500 less each year, while the cost of basic family needs continue to soar."", ""But these aren't just statistics – these are the stories of families I've met all across America.

Today, we've lost a million -- seven million jobs short of his prediction. And what does he want to do now -- even with four years of lost jobs under his belt?

America may be in the grips of an energy crisis, but with Governor Richardson at the helm, there is no shortage of energy or enthusiasm here in New Mexico.', 'Before we begin, let me say a few words about the loss of a man who was truly America\'s hero – my friend, Christopher Reeve. Teresa and I were deeply saddened to learn of his death, and we send our prayers to his loving wife Dana, his children, and his entire family. Chris was an inspiration to all of us. Without leaving his wheelchair, he was able to make great strides toward a cure for conditions like his. His tireless efforts will always be remembered and honored – and in part because of his work, millions will one day walk again. As Chris once said, ""So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable."" I know that one day we will realize Chris\' inevitable dream.\nFor 60 years, New Mexico has been at the leading edge of change and innovation. In a very real sense, we won World War II right here in this state. In the summer of 1942, with the scars of Pearl Harbor still fresh, Americans were gearing up for battle. Yes, planes and tanks had to be built at a record pace, strategies conceived, battles planned, and young Americans dispatched to frontlines around the globe. But Franklin Roosevelt knew that we needed something more. He knew we had to marshal America\'s most brilliant minds and best technology. The initiative he created was called the Manhattan Project, and it was headquartered at Los Alamos.', 'Today, we have an equally important challenge: to make America energy independent in the 21st century. Only then can we grow our economy as we should, protect our environment as we must, and keep our country as safe as it can be.', ""To do this, we need a president who will lead us there. We need a president who believes in America's great potential – and who believes that the middle class is America's greatest strength. We need a president who can see the problems facing America, and who will make the right choices to solve them."", ""But in the past four years, in nearly every decision he's made, George W. Bush has chosen the powerful and well-connected over middle class Americans."", ""The only people George Bush's policies are working for are the people he's chosen to help. They're working for drug companies. They're working for HMOs. And they're certainly working for the big oil companies."", 'The results are clear: 1.6 million private sector jobs have been lost. The cost of health care is up 64 percent. College tuition is up more than 35 percent. And the typical family is making $1,500 less each year -- while the cost of nearly everything continues to rise.', 'Right now, oil prices are at an all-time high, with no end in sight. In most parts of the country, a gallon of gas costs nearly $2 – up 30 percent since George Bush took office. In the last four years, the cost of heating the average home with heating oil has gone up 91 percent. And high energy costs have pushed up prices across the board – from the food you put on your table to the clothes your children wear.', ""A thirty percent increase in gas prices means a lot more profit for this President's friends in the oil industry. But for most middle class Americans, the Bush gas tax is a tax increase they can't afford. The funny thing is, George Bush is trying to scare you into thinking that I'm going to raise your taxes. But to borrow a saying, when it comes to George Bush's record on gas prices, he can run but he can't hide. Facts are stubborn things, Mr. President."", 'Four years ago, when he was running for president, George Bush said, ""What I think the president ought to do is ... get on the phone with the OPEC cartel and say, we expect you to open your spigots!"" Today, four years later, with gas prices at record levels, we\'re still waiting for George Bush to make that phone call! The spigot is nearly shut – his energy policy has failed – and middle class families pay the price every time they fill up the gas tank.', ""Instead of standing up for you, George Bush has chosen secret meetings with the energy industry behind closed doors in the White House, where they can make their case, but there's no one there to make yours. And then the president when all the way to the Supreme Court to protect the identity of his secret energy advisors."", ""And after four years of empty rhetoric and inaction, the Republican-controlled Congress is ending another session without passing a good energy bill for America. At the end of the day, George Bush just couldn't get it done. Just like with jobs, health care, and education, the President has more excuses than results."", 'Year after year, President Bush has proposed budgets that shortchange investments in clean, renewable, domestic sources of energy -- like wind, solar, and biomass. He ignores energy conservation. When it comes to developing a real energy policy, George Bush has run out of gas.', ""Just like on every other issue, they'll tell you they have an energy plan. But as usual, it's a plan that warms the hearts of their powerful friends and leaves you out in the cold."", 'Their plan includes tax breaks totaling nearly $15 billion for George Bush\'s friends in the oil and gas industries. The president\'s plan, not surprisingly, provides sweetheart deals for Halliburton – including an exemption from the Safe Drinking Water Act so they can do more drilling. It\'s no wonder Senator John McCain has called the Bush bill the ""No lobbyist left behind act.""', 'What\'s worse, the Administration\'s own economists have found that their energy plan won\'t reduce gas prices or reduce America\'s dependence on foreign oil. In fact, the Bush energy policy hurts other businesses and slows economic growth. For example, the airline industry will spend an extra $11.4 billion on fuel this year. Truckers will spend an additional $15.6 billion. And farmers will spend an additional $2.8 billion. Even the Chairman of the President Council of Economic Advisors admitted recently, ""High energy prices are now a drag on the economy.""', ""Higher gas prices have cost the American consumer $34 billion since George Bush took office. But guess who's profiting from all this? That's right -- the people who wrote the energy plan in the first place – the big oil companies. The money you're paying at the pump is going directly from your wallets straight into the hands of oil companies and oil producers. Over the past three years, the big three oil companies have earned a record $38.6 billion in profits."", 'The Bush plan also threatens the environment by exempting all oil and gas drilling sites from parts of the Clean Water Act. It blocks efforts by 28 states to get oil companies to clean up polluted drinking water – and it saddles taxpayers with an $8 billion cleanup bill. And it opens sensitive wildlife habitats like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and Otero Mesa here in your backyard to big oil and gas drillers.', ""Worst of all, George Bush's plan does nothing to reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign oil."", ""Today, we are importing 2.5 million barrels of oil from the Middle East every single day. In the last four years, the amount of foreign oil we consume has risen to sixty-one percent. When they went to war, this Administration's energy experts projected that oil would be as low as $28 a barrel today. Last week, gas prices hit a record $53 a barrel – and one big reason is because of this president's gross mismanagement of the war in Iraq."", ""As president, I have a real energy plan to harness the full force of America's technology and make this nation independent of Middle East oil in ten years. My plan will increase fuel efficiency, lower energy prices, produce alternative and renewable sources of energy, and create new jobs here at home. I want an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation, not the Saudi Royal family."", 'My five-point plan will make America safer, stronger and more secure.', ""First, as President, I will speed up investment in technologies that save energy and create alternative fuels. Through a new Energy Security and Conservation Trust Fund, Americans will have a guaranteed commitment to reducing our dependence on oil. We only have three percent of the world's oil reserves. There is no way for us to drill our way out of this crisis. We have to invent our way out of it. American creativity has to drive the process – and new American jobs, good jobs here at home, will be our reward."", 'Today, the funding for our energy security is sporadic, uncertain, and insufficient. We may not have the greatest oil reserves on Earth, but we do have great resources of intellect and invention to find new fuels and to conserve and optimize traditional ones. So the trust fund I propose will take existing royalties that corporations now pay for the right to drill on public lands and dedicate that money to Research and Development so that we can have cleaner and more abundant energy sources.', ""We know that the road to more energy independence depends on making our cars and trucks more energy efficient. One out of every seven barrels of oil in the world is consumed on America's highways. That's why my plan contains economic incentives to build the energy-efficient cars, trucks, SUVs, and buses of the future. And I am determined that by the year 2020, 20 percent of America's energy will come from domestically produced alternative fuels like ethanol."", 'Second, my plan reduces energy bills for American consumers. Under the Bush Administration, many Americans will be spending $500 more this winter to heat their homes. My plan will rein in out-of-control gas prices for families, farmers and businesses by restoring American leadership abroad, simplifying gasoline rules, deploying our Strategic Petroleum Reserve when appropriate, ensuring fair competition in the energy marketplace and helping industry, schools and homes increase energy efficiency and cut their energy bills. To begin with, my administration will enact efficiency standards to cut the federal energy bill by 20% -- saving $2 billion a year. We will help states, municipalities, businesses, and consumers do the same.', 'Third, we will diversify sources of energy. For four years, this administration has sat by while our dependence on foreign oil has increased. My plan will focus on finding new sources of energy. We will make clean coal a real part of our energy future. We will ensure that by the year 2020, twenty percent of our electricity comes from renewable sources like wind and solar. We will seek new sources of oil in non-OPEC countries. We will increase the supply of natural gas by developing domestic natural gas sources that are already open for leasing and drilling. And we will enhance our ability to move natural gas from Alaska and Canada.', ""Fourth, our energy grid is vulnerable; it can and must be strengthened. The August 14, 2003 blackout resulted in the loss of electricity for more than 50 million people and cost our economy $6 billion. The footprint of the blackout on both sides of the US-Canadian border included great urban areas that are heavily industrialized and important financial centers. More than a year after the August 14th blackout, George Bush hasn't taken any action to ensure that the lights don't go out again. We will."", ""Fifth, we will create 500,000 new clean energy jobs in America by providing incentives to invest in clean energy technologies and encourage job creation. Here in New Mexico, in places like the new wind farm in Quay County, you've seen how investments in renewable energy protect the environment while they also produce new jobs."", ""America once led the world in the production of clean energy products and the payrolls that go with them. We have to do it again – whether it's in wind or biomass, solar or clean coal."", ""My friends, sixty years after the Manhattan Project, Los Alamos, Sandia and all our national laboratories continue to push the boundaries of knowledge. You can continue to strengthen our national security if we invest in your capacity to safeguard our environment and make America independent of Mideast oil.

And you are leading with a uniquely American question: What if?"", 'So much promise stretches before us. America needs to climb the next mountain, look to the next horizon, and ask: What if?', 'For the sake of our children...for the sake of our security ... for the sake of our economy ... for the sake of our environment ... we must meet that challenge and make America energy independent of Mideast oil.', ""What if we do that?

No matter which way you slice it, the Congressional Budget Office reports that George Bush's scheme would cut benefits from 23 percent up to 45 percent and cost taxpayers $2 trillion.

As president, I will push the boundaries of science, and never let ideology get in the way of life-saving research or cutting-edge technology, like stem cell research. When I'm president, I will lift the ban on federal funding on stem cell research – a ban that's tied the hands of our scientists and shut down some of our most promising work on spinal cord injuries, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and other life threatening diseases."", ""We will offer tax credits to help us seize the possibilities of the Broadband Revolution and make Internet access available to all of America's families.

Our plan will provide middle-class tax cuts that bring down the biggest costs facing parents -- so they can get ahead and spend more time with their children. We'll help parents cover the rising costs of child care by offering a tax credit of $1,000. We'll give more young Americans the chance to go to college by offering a tax break on up to $4,000 in tuition for four years of college. And to pay for this, and to make sure that 98 percent of all Americans will still get a tax cut, we will close corporate loopholes, cut government waste, and roll back only the Bush tax cuts for individuals who make more than $200,000 a year.

And it means doing what this President has refused to do for four years – allowing our own Medicare program to negotiate with the drug companies to get lower prices for seniors.\nWe'll also give everyone the chance to buy affordable health insurance by allow families and small businesses to buy into the same health care plan that members of Congress give themselves. We'll cover every child in America by letting their parents sign them up for health insurance right at their own school. And we'll finally pass a Patients Bill of Rights to make sure that doctors and patients – not insurance company bureaucrats – will make medical decisions."", 'Fourth, we will leave behind an energy policy of big oil, by big oil, and for big oil by offering a fresh start on energy independence in America.

We'll give automakers tax credits up to $5000 for the fuel-efficient cars of the future so they can afford to produce these vehicles, and we'll give consumers tax credits so they can afford to buy them.

Our plan will strengthen Social Security, not undermine it. The first step to saving Social Security is getting our fiscal house in order. As president, I will make the tough choices, take on the special interests, and put our country back on the path to fiscal discipline. But I pledge this: I will not privatize Social Security. I will not cut benefits. I will not raise the retirement age. Because when you've worked for a lifetime, America owes you what you've earned."", ""After four years of a President who always gave the powerful and well-connected a handout instead of giving middle-class families a hand-up, I believe America is ready for a fresh start.

There are sound scientific reasons to invest in programs like this, because of what we now know about how the brain develops in the preschool years. But these programs are costly, and we wanted to know whether the benefits justify the cost.', 'Here is what we learned. The number of children in our program needing special education, which costs significantly more than preschool programs, dropped from 1 in 5 to 1 in 100. The number of kindergartners and first-graders not being promoted dropped from 1 in 4 to 1 in 50.', 'It is difficult to imagine a better return on investment than that, especially when you think about how those numbers translate into children succeeding in school and not ending up in trouble. Good, thoughtful philanthropy often produces returns like that. In my personal foundation we are designing programs that are helping keep prescription drug costs affordable for seniors and helping educate women about how cleaning up the environment also protects our health and the well-being of our children.', 'Those are real results that benefit us all. When we truly understand that we are all part of an interconnected web, we realize that in helping others, we are also helping ourselves.', ""The second great lesson life has taught me about giving of ourselves is that this journey requires courage. As a young woman, I attended the University of Witswatersrand in South Africa at a time when the government was preparing to extend apartheid's ugly reach into higher education. My fellow students and I risked arrest to march through the streets in protest."", ""What I learned from that experience was not that we shouldn't have bothered. Rather, I learned that sometimes it is important to speak out even when we think no one is listening, and perhaps especially then. We cannot always know how our words or deeds will resonate across time and along the strands of human connection. All we can know is that absent affirmative acts of individual conscience, evil triumphs."", 'To me, those protests were their own small act of philanthropy. So often considered a genteel act, true philanthropy frequently takes us in directions that require strength and sacrifice and risk.', 'Never was that so evident to me as when, years later, I as a young Senate wife in 1977 helped launch and then co-chaired Congressional Wives for Soviet Jewry. The women and men I met when we traveled to stand with them in the Soviet Union-giants like Ida Nudel, Judith Rattner and Vladimir Slepak-were giving something of themselves to others. The world knew them as refuseniks. They viewed themselves as standing up for freedom of religion, for the dignity of their families and their people, for the hope of a place where they could live in freedom.', 'It did not take great courage for us as Congressional wives to challenge the human rights abuses of the Soviet Union. But it did take a willingness to honor and support the bravery of those men and women who were risking their lives to speak out. It did require us to care enough about their plight to want to do something about it, to stand for those who could not stand entirely on their own, to speak for the voiceless and to shine light on the courage of the defiant.', 'That concept lies at the very core of good philanthropy. Even in ways that, compared to the sacrifices of the refuseniks, might seem utterly mundane, philanthropy is all about embracing risk. From poverty to oppression, from religious intolerance to ethnic hatred, from injustice to environmental destruction-there are no easy or obvious solutions to the great challenges of our time.', ""There is only the hope of human ingenuity. It is the task of philanthropy to cultivate that ingenuity, to support new ideas, new solutions, and new ways of applying old wisdom. In the new there is always risk, because that which has been untried might fail. But we cannot shy from that. At our foundations, we expect a certain amount of failure. We don't like it, but we believe our job is to support the experimenters, the innovators and the trail-blazers, because in them lies all hope for progress. To share the failures and the successes, because in the lessons we learn, we find the way forward."", ""The early childhood program I mentioned earlier never did reach the number of children we had hoped it would and had to be scaled back. You could view that as a failure. We chose instead to capture the learning from that effort and share it widely, and last year that information helped convince Pennsylvania finally to join the overwhelming majority of states funding early childhood programs. In philanthropy as in life, those who dare not fail can never succeed. The third great lesson I have learned about giving of ourselves is that, although it requires strength, it provides strength in even greater measure. There is a great misconception about philanthropy that it depends on the size of one's pocketbook. But what it really depends on is the size of one's heart, the openness of one's mind, a sense of conviction and an ability to leverage."", 'From my father embracing his patients and hearing their stories, to my fellow students marching in support of justice, to women and men like the Soviet refuseniks fighting for freedom, I have learned that the greatest gift we can give each other is the gift of our time and our ideas and our work. It is the gift of whatever we have to give, the gift of whatever we have inside of us.', ""I have seen that type of philanthropy practiced so many times since coming to America four decades ago. Here I discovered a land remarkably different from any I had known before. People here spoke their mind, and didn't object if you did the same-well, at times, some do if your husband is running for President."", 'And people here believe anything is possible, that anyone can set his or her sights on a dream and, with enough hard work, make it happen. So much has been made of that promise of individual opportunity that we often forget it has a flipside. For me, however, that flipside is the most remarkable aspect of America.', 'It is an ethic of individual obligation, a profound sense that with freedom comes responsibility. I see that ethic reflected in my husband, and both he and I believe it is the glue that holds this nation together and makes it great.', 'One of my earliest friends in this country was Fred Rogers, who created Mr. Roger\'s Neighborhood. After 9/11, Fred was asked what parents should tell their children to alleviate their anxiety over all the horrifying images appearing on television. He recounted something his own mother had told him when he saw grisly photographs in the newspaper. ""Look for the helpers,"" she would say. ""You will always find people who are helping.""', 'America is a nation of helpers. I have never met a people more willing as individuals to help out in ways small and great, to assist a neighbor in need, to extend the hand of friendship to a young woman newly arrived from Africa, or-as we saw on 9/11-to rush into a burning building to save the lives of complete strangers. That generous, philanthropic spirit, more than anything else, gives America its strength and sets it apart among the community of nations.', 'There is a wonderful saying from the Talmud that I think perfectly captures the tension of our own times: ""If I am not for myself, who will be for me? And if I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?""', 'What philanthropy teaches is that a spirit of generosity and connection and mutual respect does not require us to sacrifice ourselves. Rather, it reminds us that, in being for others, we are also for ourselves. In strengthening and respecting others, we strengthen and respect ourselves.', 'I think women, in particular, understand that. I am happy to say I am married to a man who also gets it, but I do think for women it comes naturally. In our roles as mothers and wives, women have for millennia managed the chaos of family and community. We have an intuitive sense for the importance of those connections.', ""That ancient wisdom is reflected in the symbol you have chosen for your work, the Lion of Judah. Like the trees I encountered in the Amazon, the lion is a symbol of strength and power. But even the lion's strength is measured by the health of the pride, and the prosperity of the land."", ""And that is why John and I both applaud the work of the National Women's Philanthropy and United Jewish Communities. In you, we see more than a great organization. We see hope-hope for our country, for the promised land of Israel, for the worldwide Jewish community, for women, and indeed for people all around this troubled globe of ours. You illustrate what can happen when strong women embrace their power and their wisdom, and come together to make their voices heard."", 'At a time when the world is more interconnected than ever in its history, and challenged by global collisions of economies, beliefs and cultures, it needs the wisdom that women like you offer. Margaret Mead once said, ""Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed people can change the world: indeed it\'s the only thing that ever has."" To that I would add, and never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed women can lead the way. And if not us, who? If not now, when?', 'Lions of Judah, I salute you and thank you for all you do.']",0

And this president has never once vetoed one bill; the first president in a hundred years not to do that."", 'Give me that line item veto pen, and I will cut the fat out of the budget.', ""Fourth, John Edwards and I will fight for automatic spending cuts if Congress can't keep spending in check."", ""This President not only ignored the spending caps we had in place since the 1990's --he got rid of them."", 'He got rid of these rules, I will restore them.', 'Finally, I will implement the McCain-Kerry proposal to end corporate welfare as we know it.', ""It's time to stop asking taxpayers to subsidize loopholes and giveaways to make rich corporations richer. Today, there are more than 100 corporate welfare programs in the budget that cost you more than $65 billion a year."", 'The McCain-Kerry proposal crosses party lines.', ""So far, John can't get anyone in the Bush White House to listen to it. Well I'll tell you what -- when I'm President, John McCain will get the first pen when I sign this bill into law."", ""My friends, this isn't about being a Democrat or a Republican. It's about what's right for America."", 'The hope for a better future is one that has sustained our nation through its best moments and its darkest days.', 'When Franklin Roosevelt came to Pennsylvania 72 years ago today, that hope seemed almost lost.', 'But the American people rose up and they forged a new future.', ""FDR believed, as you do, and I do, that America's an optimistic country – that the American dream belongs to each and every one of us...that there's nothing we can't do if we just believe in ourselves."", ""We simply can't risk destroying our fundamental compact between generations -- when you work hard and play by the rules, America should work hard to take care of you when you retire. That was Franklin Roosevelt's essential promise when he created Social Security and it's been the sacred obligation one generation has passed on to the next. I believe we're all in this together. George Bush believes you're out there on your own."", ""We can't afford to undermine our sacred compact between generations. We can't afford four more years of George Bush. We need a fresh start."", 'FDR\'s words from seven decades ago still have a powerful meaning today. He said here in Pennsylvania: ""I am as certain as mortal man can be certain...that from the moment that we set our hands openly and frankly and courageously to this problem, we shall have reached the end of our long, hard ... road ....""', 'On November 2nd, we will reach the end of this ""long, hard"" road ... and together we will take America in a new direction.', 'So I ask you to stand up on November 2nd.

We all know about those five brothers who were lost in the same ship in the Second World War, and what that kind of sacrifice means to American families and to our nation. Like the countless others who've given their lives in service, they are the greatness of America. We pause to salute them today and here in Waterloo every day you honor what they gave to our country."", ""I'm also honored to be surrounded this morning by four of our finest military leaders -- generals and admirals who know combat, who know what's going on in Iraq, and who know what it takes to keep America safe. Admiral Stansfield Turner, former Director of the CIA, General Claudia Kennedy, the highest ranking woman to ever serve in our armed forces, General Edward Baca, former head of our National Guard, and General Melvyn Montano, of the National Guard – who both know how important our reservist and guard are to America's defense, and who believe with me that they should never be subject to a backdoor draft."", ""And while they are not able to be here today, I am proud to have the support in this race, two former chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff under both President Reagan and President Clinton – Admiral William Crowe and General John Shalikashvili. I'm proud that these leaders are standing with me not just in this campaign, but for the cause of a stronger America."", ""And I am proud to have the support of so many of the widows of 9-11 led by Kristen Breitweiser, who's also with us today."", ""The other day, in a speech full of distortions, the president made it clear that he can't talk about most of the issues in this election. He wants to make it solely a contest about national security. I welcome that debate. I believe a President must be able to defend this country and fight for the middle class. I believe a president has to do both at the same time. And I believe this president has failed to make our country as safe and secure as it should be."", 'America is fighting... and must win... two wars. The war in Iraq. And the war on terror.', 'President Bush likes to confuse the two. He claims that Iraq is the centerpiece of the war on terror. In fact, Iraq was a profound diversion from that war and the battle against our greatest enemy: Osama bin Laden and the al Qaeda network.', ""But now that we're fighting two wars, we must... and we will... prevail in both. In Iraq, because the President's miscalculations have created a terrorist haven that wasn't there before. And in the worldwide struggle against the terrorists, because they attacked us ... and because they represent the greatest threat to security in our time."", ""In Iraq, every week brings fresh evidence that President Bush doesn't see what's happening – isn't leveling with the American people about why we went to war in Iraq...how the war is going – and has no idea how to put our policy back on track."", ""Here's what Americans have learned over the past two weeks:"", ""-- The President's top weapons inspector in Iraq released a final, exhaustive study, with this damning conclusion: Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction and no programs to produce them."", 'Iraq was in fact a diminishing threat. The main reason President Bush gave for rushing to war was wrong.', ""A CIA report found no clear link between Saddam's regime and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the terrorist behind the beheadings of Americans in Iraq and now an al Qaeda ally."", ""Before the war, the administration claimed that Zarqawi's presence in Iraq was proof of an Al Qaeda-Saddam collaboration. That was wrong."", ""In fact, Zarqawi was operating out of a no-man's land in North Eastern Iraq... next to territory controlled by America's Kurdish allies... not by Saddam. He and his terrorist allies were reportedly producing Ricin, a horrific biological weapon. We could have... but did not... take them out. That was a terrible mistake that this administration has never explained."", ""Paul Bremer, the President's man in Baghdad, and several senior generals have said the administration did not send enough troops to Iraq to manage the aftermath of the war."", ""That failure made it impossible to stop widespread looting and crime, to secure Iraq's borders against terrorists, and to guard one million tons of ammunition and weapons that wound up in the hands of insurgents who are using them against our troops."", ""And the failure left a power vacuum filled by Saddam loyalists... Shi'a extremists... and international terrorists, who were not in Iraq before the war, but have found a haven there now."", 'And finally, the American people learned that, nine months ago, the top U.S. commander in Iraq pleaded with the Pentagon for critical supplies to counter the growing insurgency – all of which our troops should have before they want to war -- including 36,000 sets of body armor, and spare parts for tanks, helicopters and fighting vehicles.', 'The very next day, President Bush went out and declared that our troops were properly equipped.', ""That's what Americans learned."", ""But what did the President learn? Apparently, nothing. He is in denial. He ignored these findings... just as, before the war, he ignored the uniformed military, leaders of both parties in Congress, and outside experts who predicted virtually every problem we now face in Iraq... just as today, against all the evidence, he insists that we're making good progress."", 'But the facts are grim: the coalition has lost control of areas where 1 million Iraqis live. U.S. forces are attacked an average of 87 times a day – up 100% since the spring. Over 130 foreigners kidnapped in Iraq since March.', 'Make no mistake: our troops are the best-trained and best-led forces in the world, and they have been doing their job honorably and bravely.

I believe America is stronger when we lead strong alliances."", ""Getting more countries with us in Iraq won't be easy now. In fact, this President makes it harder every day."", ""But, with new leadership, a fresh start, and new credibility, I believe it can be done... because chaos in Iraq is as bad for our allies and Iraq's neighbors as it is for us.

Now, President Bush claims my plan is what he's already doing. He couldn't be more wrong – or more out of touch with reality."", 'Last month, I said we had to get serious about training Iraqi security forces.', 'President Bush then boasted that we have ""trained about 100,000 Iraqi soldiers, police officers and other security forces personnel."" In fact, the Pentagon told Congress that we have trained only 22,700 minimally effective forces, including just 5,000 soldiers.', 'Instead of building a serious training program, the administration wasted 18 months putting untrained Iraqis into uniform to justify the inflated numbers it was giving out to the American public.', 'The result is that, for all their bravery, too few Iraqi security forces are ready for duty.', ""Here's what my administration will do differently."", 'We will treat the training of Iraqi security forces as the war time emergency it is. We will urgently expand the training program inside and outside Iraq. We will strengthen the vetting of recruits... double classroom training time... and get serious about field training. We will recruit thousands of trainers from our allies and work with them to open training centers in Europe.', ""President Bush isn't doing that. I will."", 'Last month, I said we must carry out a reconstruction plan that brings real benefits to the Iraqi people.', 'In his recent speech, the President claimed: ""we\'ve already allocated $7 billion for reconstruction efforts so more Iraqis can see the benefits of freedom.""', ""Here's what he didn't tell us. Allocated does not mean spent. It's Washington-speak calculated to mislead Americans into thinking the government has done something it hasn't."", 'In fact, only 8 percent of what this President promised has actually been spent.', 'And even worse, of the amount actually spent, just 27 cents on the dollar trickles down to projects that help Iraqis. Where do the other 73 cents go? To soaring security costs ... corruption and mismanagement ... and huge profits for contractors like Halliburton.', 'Is it any wonder that respected Republicans like Senator Richard Lugar talk about the ""incompetence of the Administration"" in Iraq?', ""Here's what my administration will do differently."", 'We will target high visibility, quick impact projects... put the personnel we need in place... and cut through the red tape. We will use more Iraqi contractors and workers, instead of big corporations like Halliburton. We will stop paying companies under investigation for fraud and corruption. And we will fire the civilians in the Pentagon responsible for mismanaging the reconstruction program.', ""The President isn't doing that. I will."", 'Last month, I said that we must take urgent, essential steps to guarantee promised elections can be held next year, including supporting the U.N. elections mission in Iraq', 'In his speech, the President said ""those elections are already scheduled for January... and the U.N. is already there.""', ""But once again, that's Washington speak and it's misleading. Scheduled does not mean they have the ability to do it."", 'In fact, the U.N. says the elections are in grave doubt because of the deteriorating security situation. There are only five U.N. election experts on the ground in Iraq. We need hundreds more, but there is no security force in place to protect them.', ""Here's what my administration will do differently."", 'We will recruit troops from other nations for a U.N. protection force. Unbelievably, we just learned that the President rejected an offer by Arab and Muslim nations to provide those troops. This was a costly failure of judgment, rooted in an ideological commitment to go it alone.', 'We will intensify the training of Iraqis to work at the polls and guard as many as 30,000 polling places. We will make sure an independent Iraqi electoral commission has the equipment and ballots it needs.', ""The President isn't doing all this. I will."", ""If President Bush really thinks his administration is implementing my plan for Iraq, he's even more out of touch with reality than I thought."", 'The second thing we must do to bring the world with us in Iraq is to give other countries a real say and a real stake – and treat them with respect.', 'At every turn... before the war... in its immediate aftermath... and today...this Administration has treated potential allies with disdain. As a result, nearly 90 percent of the coalition troops – and nearly 90 percent of the coalition casualties – are American.', 'Before the war, the U.N. Security Council voted 15-0 to demand that Saddam let the weapons inspectors back in... and threatened serious consequences if Iraq tried to stop them.', 'But our allies urged us to let the inspectors finish their work... and to make sure we had a plan to win the peace.', 'That was sound advice. It was reinforced here at home by General Brent Scowcroft, who was National Security Adviser to the first President Bush.', ""But this President wouldn't listen. He rushed to war."", ""We'll never know how many other countries would have been with us if this President had exercised sound judgment. But we do know that his disregard for other countries isolated America, not Iraq, from the rest of the world."", 'Then, immediately after we took Baghdad, the President missed another opportunity to bring other nations abroad.', 'Russia and India said they were open to sending peacekeepers... as many as 17,000.', 'Instead of accepting their offer, President Bush let Vice President Cheney talk him out of giving the U.N. the role in Iraq these countries said they needed to get involved. The president acted like the divider, not the uniter, of a global coalition.', ""Then, nine months after Saddam's statue fell, with the insurgency taking root, this President made a third critical misstep. Instead of reaching out to allies to get their help in training Iraqi security forces – which should have been our most urgent priority – this administration issued a new order prohibiting countries that were not part of the original coalition from participating in any reconstruction contracts in Iraq."", 'Is it any wonder that the United States is still paying the overwhelming majority of the reconstruction costs in Iraq?', 'By treating other countries with contempt, President Bush gave them an excuse to stay on the sidelines instead of shouldering their responsibilities.', ""As President, I will treat our allies with respect. I will encourage them to help develop Iraq's resources and to bid on contracts. I will establish an international advisory group for Iraq that includes our key allies, the world's other major powers and Iraq's neighbors... to give them a voice... and to give Iraq the support and breathing room it needs to succeed."", 'Last month, the president squandered a critical opportunity in New York, where he and other world leaders had gathered at the United Nations. I urged him to call a special summit on Iraq... right then and there... to get everyone in the room... and get commitments from them to send troops, trainers, a U.N. protection force, more financial aid and debt relief.', ""It was a decisive moment, but the President didn't even try. I will lead and I believe others will follow."", ""This President says he's a leader. Well Mr. President, look behind you. There's hardly anyone there. It's not leadership if we haven't built the strongest alliance possible and if America is almost alone."", ""The President's failures in Iraq have made us weaker, not stronger, in the war on terrorism. That is the hard truth. The President refuses to acknowledge it. But terrorism experts around the world do."", 'The Israelis know more about terrorism than anyone else because they have suffered more from it than anyone else – which is one reason we must always stand by their side.', ""And here's what one of Israel's leading institutions – the Jaffe Center for Strategic Studies – just concluded in its annual report:"", '""...Iraq [is] a major distraction from the global war on terrorism. Iraq has now become a convenient arena for jihad, which has helped Al Qaeda to recover... The U.S. presence in Iraq now demands more and more assets that might have otherwise been deployed... against the global terrorist threat.""', ""The President diverted our forces and focus from Afghanistan to Iraq. When Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda were cornered in the mountains of Tora Bora, the President should have sent U.S. forces -- not Afghan warlords – to surround the caves, and he should have used America's best mountain troops and technology to hunt down, kill and capture the terrorists."", 'But Osama got away. And what did the President say? ""I truly am not that concerned about him.""', 'And what is the result? Far from being destroyed, al Qaeda has spread, with thousands of militants plotting and planning in 60 countries... forging new relationships with at least 20 extremist groups in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.', 'Global terrorism is increasing, not receding. Since 9/11, the number of significant terrorist attacks has jumped to the highest level in 20 years.', 'The President took his eye off the terrorists.', 'I will stop at nothing to kill the terrorists before they kill us... and prevent others from taking their place.', 'That requires America to be strong. It also requires America to be smart.', ""My plan for winning the war on terrorism calls on the totality of America's strength – our military, intelligence, economic and political power."", 'First, we will destroy terrorist networks by transforming our military and reforming our intelligence services.', 'I will expand our active duty forces by 40,000 soldiers... not for Iraq... but so that we have enough troops to fight the terrorists wherever they are. This administration has resisted that plan, while instituting a back-door draft for Iraq. They have it exactly backwards.', ""I will double the Army's Special Forces capability to go after the terrorists. We will combine and grow the extraordinary fighting talent of all of our elite forces into the most versatile, deadly anti-terrorist force the world has ever known."", ""This administration opposed the creation of the 9/11 Commission, before bowing to public pressure. Now, it's dragging its feet on the Commission's bi-partisan recommendations to make America more secure."", ""Mr. President, it's time for leadership. It's time to implement the real 9/11 Commission intelligence recommendations that were passed by the Senate. Mr. President, if you don't do it now, I will do it in January."", ""The President's budget provides just 20 percent of the CIA's needs for its Counter Terrorism Center... and shortchanges our counter-terrorism efforts across the intelligence community."", 'As President, I will change that. I will be a determined leader, not a reluctant follower, when it comes to intelligence reform and funding the intelligence community.', 'Second, we will deny the terrorists the deadly weapons they seek.', 'Those weapons were not in Iraq.', 'But tons and kilotons of poorly secured chemical and nuclear weapons are spread throughout the former Soviet Union.', 'A decade ago, we began a bipartisan program to help Russia secure and destroy those weapons. This President actually tried to cut that program... and even after 9/11, he flat-lined it. At the rate President Bush is going, it will take 13 years to secure all the loose weapons in the former Soviet Union. I will get the job done in 4 years.', 'I will also lead an international effort to end the dangerous nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran.', ""Under this President's watch, North Korea's nuclear arsenal has gone from one to two nuclear bombs to six to eight bombs today. That means that North Korea... a country that will sell anything to anyone... can sell nuclear weapons to terrorists and still hold an arsenal in reserve. On George Bush's watch, America is more threatened than ever before."", ""I will work with our allies to get the 6-party talks back on track. And I will talk directly to the North Koreans... as our South Korean, Japanese, Chinese and Russian partners have requested... and seek a verifiable, irreversible end to North Korea's nuclear weapons program."", ""North Korea is not the only gathering danger. While a divided administration has been bickering with itself about Iran, that country -- the world's most active sponsor of state terrorism -- has advanced its nuclear program."", 'I will reassert American leadership. Iran must verifiably and permanently end the production of nuclear materials for weapons. If Iran refuses, I will lead the world to take tough measures, including sanctions.', 'Third, we will cut off terrorist financing.', 'According to the 9/11 Commission, this administration delayed pressuring the Saudis to shut down so-called charities that were in fact major sources of terrorist funding. They even waited until last week to turn off the financial pipeline to the terrorist the President so fervently denounces, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.', 'As President, I will impose sanctions against any bank... and any nation... that fails to cooperate in the fight against money laundering. I will insist that the Saudis crack down on charities that funnel funds to terrorists... and on anti-American and anti-Israel hate speech. And I will pursue a plan to make America independent of Mideast oil... so that no country holds our security over a barrel of oil.', 'Fourth, we will protect the homeland.', ""Even as we stay on the offensive against the terrorists, we've got to strengthen our defense."", 'For example, 95 percent of the containers coming into our ports are not screened today. I will change that.', 'Today, your luggage is x-rayed when it goes on the plane, but the cargo in the hold underneath is almost never checked. I will change that.', 'More than 2 million rail cars and 500 train stations are used by commuters everyday. Yet, the Department of Homeland Security still has no strategy to defend them...even after the terrorist attacks in Madrid. I will change that.', ""Half our fire-fighters don't have the radios they need to communicate in a crisis. I will change that."", 'More than 100 chemical plants in the United States are located in communities of one million or more people. The President caved to pressure from his big donors and dropped new plant security regulations. I will change that.', ""President Bush said during the debates that we don't have enough money to do what we must to keep Americans safe because he's determined to hold on to his tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of Americans."", 'I will change that, too.', ""I will never put a price tag on America's security."", 'My plan will screen more shipping containers and more air cargo for explosives ... invest in rail and subway security... defend our chemical and nuclear plants... increase border security...and give our first responders the equipment and personnel they need to protect America.', 'Fifth, we will deny the terrorists safe havens and new recruits...and promote freedom and democracy.', 'Today, terrorists find sanctuary, support and successors among hundreds of millions of people around the world who live in failing or repressive states... and who have no hope for the future.', 'I will refocus our attention and reform our institutions to prevent weak and failing states from becoming terrorist havens. We will lead the world to focus on economic development... debt relief... combating corruption... investing in global education...fighting infectious disease like HIV-AIDS. Each of these tools is a weapon in the war on terrorism.', 'I will launch a new era of public diplomacy to explain our policies to the world... and to combat lies and distortions about America.', 'And I will support the forces of progress in non-democratic countries... not with reckless campaigns to impose democracy by force from the outside... but by working with modernizers from the inside to build the institutions of democracy.', 'I believe we can succeed in Iraq and I know we can win the war on terror. We can defeat, capture and kill the terrorists.', 'What we need is not personal attacks for political advantage, but a capacity to see reality and a real plan for success.', 'As president, I will be resolute in confronting the evil that exists in the world. I will never hesitate to use force to confront and defeat any threat. I will never give any nation or organization a veto over our national security. I will build and lead strong alliances. And I will never forget that, in the end, one of our greatest strengths, one of our greatest safeguards, is that America can be the ideal that inspires others everywhere. If we again become that beacon of hope, we will discover in ourselves the most powerful and useful weapons in the war against the terrorists. Because if we are true to ourselves, we will show the world that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear.', ""On the morning of September 11th, Kristen Breitweiser, a wife and mother, didn't think she had a care in the world. But just after 9am, tragedy struck and in an instant, Kristen lost her husband and the father of her children."", 'Kristen has had the courage to take her unbelievable loss and transform it into an unbending determination to make America safe. She is here today, because she is doing everything we can to advance that cause.', ""I want a world where no American mother should have to lie awake at night worrying what tomorrow will bring -- whether her husband will be safe at work or her children will be safe at school the next day. No one should have to fear that students on a graduation trip to our nation's capitol or one of our greatest cities might be attacked."", 'Our hope – our determination – is nothing less than this: to live our lives confident that we are safe at home and secure in our world.

And today, I want to talk about one of the great issues that matter to middle class families: an America that leads the world in science and technology.', 'There is no issue more fundamental to creating the good jobs of the future, curing disease, making America independent of Mideast oil, and educating the next generation of scientists than our investments in science and innovation. As President, I will make science and technology a priority once again.', ""For 225 years, America has been defined by our sense of limitless possibility. We've always approached the future with imagination and dreams. What other nation could dream of flight – and have two bicycle mechanics from Ohio make it happen? What other nation could produce a man like John Glenn – who would help lead us to put the first footprints on the moon and find a path to the stars? What other nation could set out to learn more about disease and illness – and then lead an international coalition to map every single gene in the human body? This state has played an important role in that revolution – everything from the traffic light to the compact disc is a product of Ohio ingenuity."", ""But we haven't just created inventions that changed the world. In the process, we have created millions of well-paying jobs for middle class families here in Ohio and across America. The money we have spent at the federal level on research and development since World War II – working hand in hand with private investment – has been the best jobs program America has ever had. In fact, technology alone has helped account for half of all economic growth here in Ohio since 1945."", ""This hasn't just been a story of scientific imagination, but political imagination – from leaders at every step along the way who recognized that America's leadership in science and technology has given America a competitive edge in the world."", 'John Kennedy was one of those leaders.

Later in Dayton, to those who thought America could afford to wait, he said, ""this country cannot settle for being first, if; first, but; first, when; or first, maybe. We need to be first on the far side of the moon and here in this country, and that is the issue.""', 'In 1962, John Glenn became the first American to orbit the earth. Almost a decade later, another Ohioan, Neil Armstrong, completed that journey to the moon. When John Kennedy came here 44 years ago, America was falling behind in science and technology. Because of his vision, America was number one for decades. Now we are challenged not just by the successes of other countries, but by the failures of our own political leadership.', 'Once again, today America needs a President who believes in science as John Kennedy did. The American people deserve a President who understands that when America invests in science and technology, we can build a stronger economy and create jobs for the 21st Century. But George Bush has turned his back on the spirit of exploration and discovery.', 'We now have a President who is so beholden to special interests that he refuses to make the kinds of investments that benefit our common interests.', 'On one hand, he fights for corporate interests at the expense of the middle class. On the other hand, he has an extreme political agenda that slows instead of advances science.', ""It is wrong to take hope away from people. Hope is what gave us the polio vaccine and other breakthroughs in medicine. It is wrong to tell scientists that they can't cross the frontiers of new knowledge. It is wrong morally and it is wrong economically.

This summer, 48 Nobel Laureates sent an open letter to the American people in which they said of the Administration, ""By reducing funding for scientific research, they are undermining the foundation of America\'s future."" These same Nobel Laureates have gone on record as saying the Bush Administration has systematically distorted facts to sustain their extreme positions.', ""In other words, the Administration's approach on scientific research is the same pattern we see in Iraq and on the economy today: if their policy isn't supported by the facts, then they just change the facts."", 'Under this President, America has been losing its lead in science. Our share of industrial patents is down, our share of Nobel prizes is down, our published research is down, and the number of new doctorates in the sciences is down.', ""The rest of the world isn't waiting for us to catch back up. In fact, this year, China and India will graduate 10 times as many engineers as we will have here in the U.S."", 'My friends, there is absolutely no reason why America should fall behind China on anything when it comes to innovation. If Asia can produce more research scientists, so can Ohio. If Tsinghua University can develop the jobs of the future, so can Ohio State. If Bangalore can be completely wired for broadband, then so can Dayton and Columbus.', ""This moment in history is too important -- the opportunities before us are too great – for America to trust a President who doesn't trust science. We need a fresh start on science and innovation. As President, I will see to it that America is once again at the forefront of scientific discovery."", ""First, we are going to create the well-paying jobs of the future by investing more in areas of research that are likely to create the industries that produce those jobs. Over the past four years, this Administration has lost more than 800,000 technology jobs, many to China and India. To keep and create good jobs here at home, we are going to close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas – and we'll reward companies that create and keep good jobs here at home."", 'We will invest in areas like advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, and nanotechnology that have the potential to improve lives and save them. And because we do not know where the next great breakthroughs will come from, I will support curiosity-driven, high-risk research that has given us such ""accidental"" discoveries as the MRI.', ""Second, we are going to help cure disease by investing in science and new technologies. We will not stand in the way of the future. We will find it. We will lift President Bush's ban on federal funding for stem cell research."", 'By blocking stem cell research, President Bush has sacrificed science to ideology. I agree with leaders from both political parties that stem cell research represents some of the best hopes of humanity. We are going to make funding for this research a priority. And we will uphold the highest ethical standards in the process.', ""Third, we are going to make America independent of Mideast oil by investing in the energy technology of the future – in innovations that will create good jobs across America. America once led the world in the production of clean energy products and the payrolls that go with them. We have to do it again – whether it's in wind, solar, ethanol, or clean coal."", ""We'll give automakers tax credits to retool their plants so they can build the fuel-efficient cars of the future, and we'll make sure that alternative energy sources will account for 20 percent of our fuel and 20 percent of our electricity by 2020. We will invest in energy-saving technologies so our homes, businesses, and factories are more efficient. I believe it's high time we had an America that relied on its own energy ingenuity – and not the Saudi Royal Family."", ""Fourth, we are going to create the workforce of the future by making college more affordable and preparing our workers for tomorrow's economy. If you're a freshman at Ohio State this fall, you are paying 74 percent more -- $3,000 more – than a student who arrived here in 2000. To make college more affordable, we will offer a tax credit on $4,000 of tuition so young Americans can turn their aspirations into achievement."", ""To close the growing skills gap on math and engineering between America and the rest of the world, we will support all-girls math and science schools and special after- school and summer programs that aim to get more girls and minorities engaged in math and science at an early age. We will give colleges new financial incentives to increase the number of science, technology and math majors they graduate, and double the National Science Foundation's graduate scholarships in these fields."", 'I am going to be a President who believes in science.', ""In the end, this isn't just about policy, it's about hope. It's about honoring the families here in Ohio who have seen jobs go overseas, and hope somebody is looking out for them. It's about honoring the mothers who want their children to grow up in world where the ground is safe to play on and the air is safe to breath. It's about honoring the hopes of my friend, Chris Reeve."", ""Chris had an unquenchable belief in the innovation and genius of America. He drew strength from the talent and dedication of scientists he met. And in turn, he inspired them, too – stunning doctors by regaining some sensation over 70 percent of his body and moving most of his joints. He never lost faith that America and American science was the greatest hope for humanity. That's a faith I believe all of us should share, for Chris Reeve, and the millions of people like him who believe in the possibilities of this remarkable time and our remarkable country. Some ask, how can we do it? My question is, how can we commit ourselves to anything less? With your help, that's the kind of President I'll be. I ask for your vote.

They deserve a fresh start with a President who's going to take responsibility, face reality, and make sure that they don't just get by – they get ahead. If you give me that chance – I will be that President."", ""First, as President, I'm going to make sure that working women get the wages they've earned – and not a penny less.

That will help more than 9 million women and, for those working full time, it will mean an increase in their incomes of over $3,800 a year. We're also going to create good paying jobs that let families get ahead. We're going to provide real tax cuts for middle class families to put money back in the pockets of hard-working women. We're going to roll back George Bush's overtime pay restrictions. And we'll close the pay gap once and for all – because, in America, equal work should mean equal pay, no, ands, ifs, or buts about it. We're going to shatter the glass ceiling, because in our America, all people are created equal."", ""Second, we'll provide immediate relief to women and families who've been hard hit by soaring health care costs.

And we will guarantee that medical decisions are made by patients and doctors, not by the government, and not by some HMO bureaucrats sitting behind a computer screen thousands of miles away."", ""Third, we're going to do everything it takes to provide a quality education for every American child and open the doors of college for every American family. George Bush talks a lot about No Child Left Behind, but what he doesn't tell you is that he's left the funding behind. He doesn't tell you that he's tried to cut afterschool programs for half a million children. He doesn't tell you that he broke his promise and actually cut college aid for millions of students."", ""That's the wrong choice for women and their families, and we're going to change it."", ""We're going to fight to ensure that every child in America goes to a safe, quality school with smaller class sizes, good teachers and high-standards. We'll fully fund No Child Left Behind, and offer three and a half million children the afterschool programs they need to keep them off the streets and out of trouble. In the richest country on earth, it makes no sense to spend $50,000 a year to send a kid to prison for life, when we can spend $10,000 a year on early childhood education, Head Start, Smart Start, the best possible start in life."", ""Educational opportunity begins in the early years, but it doesn't end until every child achieves their full potential. We'll offer a tax credit on up to $4,000 of college tuition so that young Americans can turn their aspirations into achievement."", ""Finally, we're going to make sure that women get the decent retirement they deserve. More than anyone else, women depend on Social Security. Too often, they have less in savings and less to fall back on – yet they live longer. For them, Social Security is not just a promise, it's a lifeline."", 'George Bush\'s promise was to protect Social Security. But for four years, he\'s raided the Social Security trust fund to pay for tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. And recently, he said that if he was re-elected, he\'d ""come out strong"" to privatize Social Security. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, that means benefit cuts of 25 to 45 percent. But what does it mean for a woman whose only income is a $1100 a month Social Security check? It means cutting more pills in half ... it means not being able to buy a birthday gift for a grandchild ... it means sitting awake at night, often all alone, worrying about what tomorrow will bring. That\'s the wrong choice for women and seniors – and we\'re not going to let it happen. The Scripture says honor thy father and mother. So let me state it plainly: I will not privatize Social Security. I will not cut benefits. And I will not raise the retirement age. Instead, I will restore fiscal responsibility so we can reduce the deficit and save Social Security.', ""In eleven days, we face a fundamental choice. Do we want four more years of a President who's out of touch with women's lives and measures his success by how much he's done for those with the most? Or do we want a fresh start with a President who measures progress by what he's done to help women who work hard at a job – and who work at the most important job of all, raising our children."", 'The choice is in your hands. The women of America can write the future of America if they go to the polls and make their voices heard.', ""Imagine if the roughly 38 million women who didn't vote in 2000 came together and said: we need a president who's on our side. Imagine 38 million votes for good jobs...38 million votes for quality health care ... 38 million votes for real retirement security ... 38 million votes for a better life for our children."", ""That can be our future – if we choose it. You don't have to settle for more of the same.

We had a good conversation and we talked about the danger of division in our country and the need – the desperate need – for unity, for finding the common ground, coming together. Today, I hope that we can begin the healing. In America it is vital that every vote count, and that every vote be counted.

Our fight goes on to make affordable health care an accessible right for all Americans, not a privilege. Our fight goes on to protect the environment, to achieve equality, to push the frontiers of science and discovery, and to restore America's reputation in the world. I believe that all of this will happen -- and sooner than we may think -- because we're America. And America always moves forward."", ""I've been honored to represent the citizens of this commonwealth in the United States Senate now for 20 years.

When we began, no one thought it was possible to even make this a close race.

And we defined that choice to America."", ""I'll never forget the wonderful people who came to our rallies, who stood in our rope lines, who put their hopes in our hands, who invested in each and every one of us. I saw in them the truth that America is not only great, but it is good."", ""So here -- so with a grateful heart -- I leave this campaign with a prayer that has even greater meaning to me now that I've come to know our vast country so much better. Thanks to all of you and what a privilege it has been. And that prayer is very simple: God bless America. Thank you.""]",0
