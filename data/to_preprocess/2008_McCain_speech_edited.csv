We need change and I know how to deliver it. The status quo is not on the ballot. Change is coming. The question is: in what direction will we go?', 'As president, I will help to create jobs for Americans in the most effective way a president can: cutting taxes, giving small business owners the tools to create new jobs and protecting your life savings. I will lead reforms to help families keep their homes, help every citizen afford health care and lead America to reclaim its energy independence.', ""My plan to cut capital gains taxes on investments will make sure that those families forced to sell assets during this downturn aren't penalized. We will also suspend the rules to prevent our seniors from being forced to sell off their IRAs during a weak market. These initiatives will have a real effect on working men and women of Missouri who look to pension and retirement plans in the future."", ""In tough economic times, higher taxes are the last thing we need as a nation. Sen. Obama's plan will raise taxes on business that generate more than half of the income of all small businesses in America. They are the backbone of our economy, and will lead us to recovery. While Sen. Obama wants to control wealth and spread it around, I want to create wealth and spread opportunity."", 'Having visited Missouri often, both Gov. Sarah Palin and I know how important mainstream values and enjoyment of the outdoors are to you. When she visited Springfield and saw the Ozarks, Gov. Palin felt at home with the area and the people who share our values.', 'Gov. Palin and I know that there is no greater nobility than to sacrifice for a great cause and no cause greater than protection of human dignity.', ""Decency, human compassion, self-sacrifice and the defense of innocent life will be the guiding principles of a McCain-Palin administration. It's about changing the culture of America. I am pro-life. We need to tell young American women who are faced with this terrible decision that we will help them have the courage to bring a baby into this world and we'll have the compassion and help them in every way that they can address it."", 'Gov. Palin and I both know what sportsmen mean to conservation efforts. Everyone who spends time in a stand or a blind or in waders knows how much the environment means to us. We enjoy the natural blessings God has given our country, and we know how important it is to share it with our children.', 'Sen. Obama tells us that the ""tradition"" of gun ownership is one which must ""be respected."" It is obvious to Gov. Palin and I that he just doesn\'t get it. A tradition is one thing; a constitutional right is another. Sen. Obama has a record of not supporting the Second Amendment, including support of the D.C. gun ban, which was ruled unconstitutional.', ""A president doesn't get to pick and choose which parts of the Constitution he gets to enforce, and I view the right to own a gun as sacred as our right to free speech."", 'I have been upholding my oath to support and defend the Constitution, putting my country first, since I was 17 years old about to enter the United States Naval Academy. I have had the great fortune of defending her liberty in uniform and defending the rights of her citizens in the Congress.', 'I believe my experience will inspire a generation of Americans to serve a cause greater than their own self-interests.', 'We cannot afford to spend the next four years as we have spent much of the last eight: waiting for our luck to change. We have to act immediately. We have to stand together and fight. I ask that you stand together with me on Nov. 4, so that we can truly change to a new direction -- one that puts our country first.']",0
1,            John McCain          ,"November 03, 2008","['[delivered at midnight]', '""Thank you! My friends, it\'s official: There\'s just one day left until we take America in a new direction!', ""We need to win Florida on November 4th, and with your help - we're going to win here, and bring real change to Washington. I need your help. Volunteer. Knock on doors. Get your neighbors to the polls. With your help, we can win. We need a new direction, and we have to fight for it."", ""I've been fighting for this country since I was seventeen years old, and I have the scars to prove it. If I'm elected President, I will fight to shake up Washington and take America in a new direction from my first day in office until my last. I'm not afraid of the fight, I'm ready for it."", ""We're going to cut taxes for working families. And we will cut business taxes to help create jobs, and keep American businesses in America. Senator Obama's massive new tax increase would kill jobs and make a bad economy worse. I'm not going to let that happen. We need pro-growth and pro-jobs economic policies, not pro-government spending programs paid for with higher taxes."", ""If I'm elected President, I won't spend nearly a trillion dollars more of your money. Senator Obama will. I'm going to make government live on a budget just like you do. And I will veto every single pork barrel bill Congresses passes."", ""I'm not going to spend $750 billion dollars of your money just bailing out the Wall Street bankers and brokers who got us into this mess. Senator Obama will. I'm going to make sure we take care of the working people who were devastated by the excesses of Wall Street and Washington."", ""I have a plan to fix our housing market, to get home values up and keep people in their homes. That's the American dream and I'm going to protect it."", ""Democrats are talking about taxing your 401k contributions. I'm going to protect people's retirement, not tax it. I'm going to protect Social Security. I'm going to protect Medicare. And I'm not going to let this Congress tax away your retirement savings."", ""If I'm elected President, we're going to stop spending $700 billion to buy oil from countries that don't like us very much. We are going to create millions of new jobs with alternative energies. We will lower the cost of energy with every energy alternative - wind, solar, tidal, hybrid cars, clean coal, safe nuclear power, and environmentally safe offshore drilling. Senator Obama opposes drilling. When I am president, we will drill offshore, and we will drill now."", 'Senator Obama told Joe the Plumber - or as they say in little Havana: Pepe el Plomero - that he wants to quote ""spread the wealth around."" He\'s running to be Redistributionist in Chief. I\'m running to be Commander in Chief. Senator Obama is running to spread the wealth. I\'m running to create more wealth. Senator Obama is running to punish the successful. I\'m running to make everyone successful.', ""This is the fundamental difference between Senator Obama and me. We both disagree with President Bush on economic policy. The difference is that he thinks taxes have been too low, and I think that spending has been too high. My friends, I'm not George Bush. If Senator Obama wanted to run against George Bush, he should have run four years ago."", ""If we are going to change Washington, we need a President who has actually fought for change and made it happen. The next President won't have time to get used to the office. We face many challenges here at home, and many enemies abroad in this dangerous world."", 'Senator Biden has warned that Senator Obama would be tested with an international crisis, and at the same time, Democrats in Congress are talking about deep defense cuts. We have troops fighting in two wars, and their answer is to lower our defenses and put someone in office who our enemies will test.', ""I've been tested, and I've passed that test. Senator Obama hasn't. He's been wrong during this whole campaign. He said he would sit down unconditionally with dictators like the Castro brothers. When Russia invaded Georgia, Sen. Obama said the invaded country should show restraint. He opposed the surge strategy that has worked in Iraq and will work in Afghanistan. When I am president, we are going to win in Iraq and win in Afghanistan, and our troops will come home with victory and honor."", ""Let me give you some straight talk about the election. America faces a big choice, and there's just 1 day left. The pundits have written us off, just like they've done before, and my opponent is measuring the drapes in the White House. They may not know it, but the Mac is Back! And we're going to win this election!"", ""I'm an American. And I choose to fight. Don't give up hope. Be strong. Have courage. And fight. Fight for a new direction for our country. Fight for what's right for America."", 'Fight to clean up the mess of corruption, infighting and selfishness in Washington.', 'Fight to get our economy out of the ditch and back in the lead.', 'Fight for the ideals and character of a free people.', ""Fight for our children's future."", 'Fight for justice and opportunity for all.', 'Stand up to defend our country from its enemies.', 'Stand up, stand up, stand up and fight. America is worth fighting for. Nothing is inevitable here. We never give up. We never quit. We never hide from history. We make history. Now, let\'s go win this election and get this country moving again.""']",0

He goes to Iraq, helps the Iraqi people with the rule of law and I'm proud of Senator Lindsay Graham of South Carolina. You know, political courage is not a, a bit of a scarce commodity and I'm very proud and grateful that a person who came across the aisle in an incredible act of political courage and supported my candidacy when it mattered the most, a truly great American, Senator Joe Lieberman and his wife. You know, it's funny. We got Joe the Plumber, Joe Lieberman. That's great. And then we got Joe the Biden. Well, you can't be perfect, my friends. and could I mention my 96-year-old mother who has more energy that anybody in this room, Roberta McCain. A couple of Christmases ago, she wanted to drive around France, so she flew to Paris. She wanted to rent a car, they said she was too old, so she bought one. When anybody ever asks anything about my age, I always introduce them to my mother. I'm so grateful you're here. My son, Doug, and his wife are here. I want to thank all of you."", ""I feel the momentum. I feel it and you feel it and we're going to win this election. We're going to win it and we're going to -- we're going to win it right here in the state of Colorado. And I bring greetings, I bring greetings from the great governor of the state of Alaska, Sarah Palin, whose ignited this campaign, who has done an incredible job. She's got a husband whose name is Todd. She calls him first dude. Her husband Todd is a four-time world champion in a snow mobile race across Alaska in the middle of the winter. One time, he was running this race, broke his arm with 250 miles to go and still won."", ""I think he's ready for Washington, DC. And so is she. Don't you think? Now, I'd like to thank all the veterans who are here. Would you raise your hands so we can say thank you for your service? Thank you very much. Thank you. Air Force Brat for McCain. Thank you. And here is two special people marine girlfriend for McCain and army girlfriend for McCain. Thank you. Military moms for McCain. Thank you. I want to say thank you again, I want to say it's great to get a turnout today."", ""We've got to turnout our vote and we're going to be up late tonight. And you know, some of the the pundits have written us off, they may not know it, but the Mac is back. With your help, we're going to take America in a new direction. Get out there and vote. I need your help. Volunteer. Knock on doors, get your neighbors to the polls, drag them there if you need to. We're going to bring real change to Washington and we have to fight for it!"", ""So, my friends, you know, you know that I've been fighting for this country since I was 17 years old and it's been the honor of my life and I've never lived a day, in good times or bad, that I didn't thank god for the privilege of serving the United States of America. I owe this country more than it will ever owe me. And i promise you if I'm elected president, I will never let you down. I'll fight to shake up Washington and take America in a new direction from my first day in office until my last. I'm not afraid of the fight, I'm ready for the fight!"", ""And we're going to cut taxes for working families and we'll cut business taxes to help create jobs and keep American businesses in America. We're going to get the spending in Washington under control. I'm going to make government live on a budget just like you do! And I'll veto every single pork barrel bill that comes across my desk! You will know their names, I'll make them famous. And we're going to make sure we take care of the working people who were devastated by the excesses and greed and corruption of wall street and Washington. My friends, we have to fix our housing market."", ""We've got to get home values up. Keep people in their homes. That's the American dream. I'm going to protect it. We'll keep people in their homes! My friends, we're going to protect people's retirement. Don't be afraid of the scare tactics that get trotted out every four years. They try to scare seniors. I was there when we fixed social security and I'm going to be there when we fix it again. I'm going to protect social security. I'm going to protect Medicare and I'm not going to let Washington tax away your retirement savings. And my friends, if I'm elected president, when I'm elected president -- we're going to stop spending $700 billion to buy oil from countries that don't like us very much. We will invest in every energy alternative, wind, solar, tide, hybrid cars, clean coal technology! Safe nuclear power and offshore drilling, when I'm president, we will drill offshore and we will drill now! I think we ought to, we ought to hear it one more time. Drill, baby, drill. And we will. And we will, my friends."", ""If we're going to change Washington, we need a president who can make it happen. I've been fighting for change in Washington my whole career and I wasn't elected miss congeniality because of it. The next president won't have time to learn how to change Washington or get used to the office. America faces many challenges at home and there are many enemies abroad in this world. Today, we elect a commander in chief to lead this nation. I know how to deal with our enemies and I know how to deal with our friends. You know, there's be a lot of talk recently about the tests the next president will face. My friends, I've been tested and I've passed the test."", ""When many of both parties wanted to retreat in Iraq, I said no, I'd rather lose an election than lose a war.

Let me give you a little straight talk about the election today. I know you're worried. America's a great country. We're in a moment of national crisis that will determine our future. Let me ask you: will we continue to lead the world's economies or be over taken? Will the world become safer or more dangerous? Will our military remain the strongest in the world and will our children and grandchildren's future be brighter than ours? My answer to you is yes! Yes, we will lead. Yes, we will prosper. Yes, we will be safer. Yes, we will pass on to our children, a stronger, better country. But we must be prepared to act swiftly, boldly, with courage and wisdom! I'm an American and I choose to fight! Don't give up hope! Be strong! Have courage and fight! Fight for a new direction for our country!"", ""Fight for what's right for America.

But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving.', 'This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight.', ""I've always believed that America offers opportunities to all who have the industry and will to seize it. Senator Obama believes that, too."", ""But we both recognize that, though we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nation's reputation and denied some Americans the full blessings of American citizenship, the memory of them still had the power to wound."", ""A century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt's invitation of Booker T. Washington to dine at the White House was taken as an outrage in many quarters."", 'MCCAIN: America today is a world away from the cruel and frightful bigotry of that time. There is no better evidence of this than the election of an African-American to the presidency of the United States.', 'Let there be no reason now...', '(APPLAUSE)', 'Let there be no reason now for any American to fail to cherish their citizenship in this, the greatest nation on Earth.', '(APPLAUSE)', 'Senator Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it, and offer him my sincere sympathy that his beloved grandmother did not live to see this day. Though our faith assures us she is at rest in the presence of her creator and so very proud of the good man she helped raise.', 'Senator Obama and I have had and argued our differences, and he has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain.', 'These are difficult times for our country. And I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face.', 'I urge all Americans...', '(APPLAUSE)', 'I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited.', 'Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans.
