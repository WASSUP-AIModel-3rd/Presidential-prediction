It is great to be here in the city of Henderson, in the beautiful state of Nevada – a state where I have so many great friends and employees.', 'In 34 days, we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House.', 'How many of you watched the Vice Presidential Debate last night?', 'Mike did such an incredible job. I would argue that Mike had the single most decisive victory in the history of Vice Presidential debates.', 'Last night America also got a firsthand look at my judgement and the judgement of my opponent. Our first Presidential decision was the selection of our running mates, and all of America saw that I made the right choice.', 'While Mike laid out big and bold solutions for America, his opponent talked only of small and petty distractions.', ""Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and hasn't fixed anything. In fact, she's just made things worse – she failed upstate New York, promising to create 200,000 jobs, but manufacturing is down almost 40 percent. She failed overseas, producing only death and destruction – she unleashed ISIS, destabilized Iraq, Syria and Libya, and put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons."", 'At home, Hillary Clinton failed Latinos and African-Americans, producing only more poverty in the inner cities.', 'She is merely the vessel for the global special interests bleeding this country dry.', 'I am running to represent Americans – and we are going to make America Rich again.', 'I am going to end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, keep jobs from pouring out of our country, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses.', 'My economic agenda is very simple: jobs, jobs, jobs.', 'The problems we face as a country are immense, and it is going to take bold action to turn things around.', 'Right now, we owe $20 trillion in debt. It doubled under President Obama.', 'Our infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.', 'The homicide rate last year experienced the biggest single-year increase in 45 years.', 'Our police are under-funded, under-staffed, and under-supported – and Hillary Clinton basically accuses our police of all being racist.', 'Our border is wide open, and drugs and criminal cartels are pouring into the country.', 'Thousands of refugees are being admitted, with no way to screen them, and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare – even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need.', 'Our annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year.', 'The federal budget is a disaster. Our State Department, mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton, misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds.', 'We have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.', 'We are a nation divided, with race riots in the streets.', ""Our college students graduate, loaded with debt, only to discover they can't find jobs – or certainly not the jobs they want."", ""Our allies aren't paying their fair share, foreign countries like Russia and China do not respect us, and our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities can't provide the most basic services."", 'America needs a turnaround.', 'America needs a comeback.', 'America needs a change.', 'That is why I am running.', 'On November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is back – bigger, and better, and stronger than ever before.', 'First, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.', 'President Obama said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.', 'That was a lie.', 'He promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars. Instead, they surged $5,000.', 'Another lie.', 'Now, of all people, President Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare.', 'Two days ago, Bill Clinton torched President Obama\'s signature legislation. Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare ""one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.""', 'Bill has a different view. Here is what bill said:', 'He just said it\'s a ""crazy system,"" and that ""it\'s the craziest thing in the world.""', 'Bill said:', '""people out there [are] busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, [and] wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half…the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies."" Clinton added that it ""doesn\'t make any sense,"" and that ""the insurance model doesn\'t work.""', 'On my first day in office, I am going to ask a Republican Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.', 'There is only one way to stop Obamacare: to vote for Trump. The deadline to register to vote by mail is October 8th. The deadline to register to vote online or in-person is October 18th. And early voting begins on the 22nd.', 'Fixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival', 'China, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money – the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens.', ""We're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on."", 'Our jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore. Too much is being made in other countries.', 'When I am President, we will start making things in America again.', ""Our nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA – a deal supported by Hillary Clinton. Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs."", 'Since China entered the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal – 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.', ""That's 15 factories closing a day, on average."", 'We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.', 'As the factories leave, our money leaves with them. Stores close, schools suffer, the tax base erodes, wages fall and the quality of life declines.', 'Real cash wages for many workers today are lower than they were in 1973.', ""We've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own. Skyscrapers go up in Beijing, while plants and factories crumble in the United States."", 'Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries.', ""And now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also."", ""We are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers."", 'We are also going to stand up to foreign currency manipulation, and apply tariffs to countries that cheat.', 'We will also stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the deal Hillary called the ""Gold Standard."" The backers of the deal have donated heavily to Hillary Clinton, and their wish is her command.', 'She is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.', 'I am an outsider fighting for YOU.', 'We will stop the foreign cheating, the product dumping, and the one-sided trade deals. We will lower taxes on American business, from 35% to 15%, and many small businesses will file as individuals any pay only 12 percent. On top of that, we will have the largest regulatory reform in American history.', 'Our tax, trade, energy and regulatory reforms will help us reach 4% growth and create at least 25 million new jobs in a decade.', 'America will become the great jobs magnet of the world.', 'Factories will come rushing in, our schools and communities will be revitalized, and our poorest citizens will get new jobs and higher pay –and new hope.', 'But to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation.', 'Security begins at the border.', 'Any government that does not protect its own people is a government unworthy and unfit to lead.', 'Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this President Obama and Hillary Clinton.', 'This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into a U.S. community under the immigration policies of Obama-Clinton. He was released again after the crime, and is now at large.', 'Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top of her class, the day before.', 'Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody.', 'Another victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times.', ""Then there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administration's priorities for removal."", 'In California, a 64-years old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but was never deported.', 'Also in California, my good friend, Jamiel Shaw, lost his amazing son at the age of 17 – he was viciously shot and killed by an illegal immigrant. The killer had 3 gun charges, as well as battery of a police officer, prior to the shooting but he had not been deported from our country.', 'There are more than 2 million criminal aliens with criminal convictions in the country right now, and more who have escaped the law entirely – when I am President, we are getting them out, and we are getting them out quickly.', ""All Americans living lawfully in this country, including millions of patriotic hardworking immigrants, are entitled to have their jobs, their wages, and their security protected. The borders around our nation are for the benefit of all people living here today – and when those borders are erased, it's often the lawful immigrants already here who are the first to suffer lost jobs and decreased security."", 'At the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists. Just two days ago, an immigrant from Bangladesh was charged in another ISIS plot. Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11.', ""The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country – as was the mall shooter in Washington State. Now, the media doesn't want to talk about this – they don't want to ask how our vetting procedures failed, or how immigration from high-risk parts of the world increased the chances of terrorism and violence."", 'The Boston Bombers were here on asylum. The San Bernardino Shooter was here on a fiancé visa from Saudi Arabia. The Orlando shooter was the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.', 'I am going to keep the terrorists out of our country.', 'Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees.', 'Hillary is for open borders.', 'I am not running to be President of the world. I am running to be President of the United States. I am for America First.', 'For the first time in American history, we have the endorsement of our ICE officers and our Border Patrol officers.', 'We are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep our people safe. I have a simple message for the cartels, the gang members, and the drug dealers preying on our citizens – your days are numbered, and your reign of crime will soon come crashing to an end.', 'We are also going to end the government corruption', 'Hillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails – after a congressional subpoena. She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals.', ""Now we have learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops."", 'Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise and the only way to deliver justice is to mail in your ballots.', 'We are also going to fix our inner cities, and help Latino Americans', '45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty.', ""58% of African-American youth don't have jobs."", 'More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.', 'Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.', ""The Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, sixty years, seventy years or more. They've produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime."", 'To those African-Americans suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose? Vote For Donald Trump. I will fix it.', 'I am also going to fight to help millions of Latinos trapped in poverty, and to help their children grow up in safety and peace.', 'Poor communities will see a massive infusion of new small businesses, and new high-paying jobs. I am also going to fight to provide school choice to every low-income African-American and Latino child in this nation.', 'I want to put every American child on the ladder of success: a great education, and a high-paying job.', 'Here are some more amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:', 'We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; end common core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.', 'This Election Day, you have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this country.', 'On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.', 'The failed and corrupt political establishment will be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.', 'I am going to fight for every last citizen in this land, and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.', 'Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.', ""You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.

That deal is grounded in three promises: safe communities, great education, and high-paying jobs.', 'My vision rests on a principle that has defined this campaign: America First.', 'Every African-American citizen in this country is entitled to a government that puts their jobs, wages and security first.', ""I'm asking today for the honor of your vote, and the privilege to represent you as your President. Here is the promise I make to you: whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion.

And every day, the same people, getting rich off our broken system, tell us that we can't change and that we can't try anything new."", ""I have a message for all the doubters in Washington: America's future belongs to the dreamers, not the cynics."", ""And it's time to extend that dream to every African-American citizen in this country."", 'African-American citizens have sacrificed so much for this nation. They have fought and died in every war since the Revolution, and from the pews and the picket lines they have lifted up the conscience of our country in the long march for Civil Rights.', 'Yet, too many African-Americans have been left behind.', '45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty.', '58% of African-American youth are not currently employed.', 'African-Americans compromise roughly 13 percent of the population, yet make-up 60% of murder victims under the age of 22.', ""In 2015, violent crime in Charlotte increased by 18 percent – and it's expected to rise 24% in 2016."", 'In the city of Chicago, nearly 3,500 people have been shot since January of this year.', 'The conditions in our inner cities today are unacceptable.', ""The Democrats have run our inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years or more.

Their policies have failed, and they've failed miserably."", ""They've trapped children in failing government schools, and opposed school choice at every turn."", ""The Clintons gave us NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization, two deals that de-industrialized America, uprooted our industry, and stripped bare towns like Detroit and Baltimore and the inner cities of North Carolina. This state has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary's NAFTA, decimating the African-American middle class."", 'Democratic policies have also given rise to crippling crime and violence.', 'Then there is the issue of taxation and regulation. Massive taxes, massive regulation of small business, and radical restrictions on American energy, have driven jobs and opportunities out of our inner cities. Hillary wants to raise taxes on successful small businesses as high as 45 percent – which will only drive more jobs out of your community, and into other countries.', 'One of the greatest betrayals has been the issue of immigration. Illegal immigration violates the civil rights of African-Americans. No group has been more economically-harmed by decades of illegal immigration than low-income African-American workers. Hillary\'s pledge to enact ""open borders,"" – made in secret to a foreign bank – would destroy the African-American middle class.', ""At the center of my revitalization plan is the issue of trade.

Dodd-Frank has been a disaster, making it harder for small businesses to get the credit they need. The policies of the Clintons brought us the financial recession – through lifting Glass-Steagall, pushing subprime lending, and blocking reforms to Fannie and Freddie. It's time for a 21st century Glass Steagall and, as part of that, a priority on helping African-American businesses get the credit they need."", 'We will also encourage small-business creation by allowing social welfare workers to convert poverty assistance into repayable but forgive-able micro-loans.', 'Then there is the issue of public safety. Making our communities safe again will be a priority for the Trump Administration.', 'I have heard and have listened to the concerns raised by African-American citizens about our justice system, and I promise that under a Trump Administration the law will be applied fairly, equally and without prejudice. There will be only one set of rules – not a two-tiered system of justice. The best evidence of unequal justice is that Hillary Clinton could violate so many laws, bleach and delete 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena, lie to Congress and the FBI – put our national security at grave risk – and not even face so much as a fine.', 'Equal justice also means the same rules for Wall Street. The Obama Administration never held Wall Street accountable.', 'We will also police our streets. I want every poor African-American child to be able to walk down the street in peace. Safety is a civil right. The problem is not the presence of police but the absence of police. I will invest in training and funding both local and federal law enforcement operations to remove the gang members, drug dealers, and criminal cartels from our neighborhoods. The reduction of crime is not merely a goal – but a necessity. We will get it done. The war on police urged on by my rival is reckless, and dangerous, and puts African-American lives at risk. We must work with our police, not against them.', 'On immigration, my policy is simple. I will restore the civil rights of African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans, by ending illegal immigration. I will reform visa rules to give American workers preference for jobs, and I will suspend reckless refugee admissions from terror-prone regions that cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. A portion of the money saved by enforcing our laws, and suspending refugees, will be re-invested in our inner cities. It is time to help the American citizens who have become refugees in their own country.', 'Infrastructure will be another major goal. My contract calls for $1 trillion dollars in infrastructure investment, of which the inner cities will be a major beneficiary.', ""I will also cancel all wasteful climate change spending from Obama-Clinton, including all global warming payments to the United Nations. These steps will save $100 billion over 8 years, and this money will be used to help rebuild the vital infrastructure, including water systems, in America's inner cities."", ""School choice is at the center of my plan. My proposal redirects education spending to allow every disadvantaged child in America to attend the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. School choice is the great civil rights issue of our time, and I will be the nation's biggest cheerleader for school choice in all 50 states. I will also appoint a commission to investigate the school to prison pipeline and to shut it down and create a new pathway that leads from a great education to a great job. My plan will also ensure funding for Historical Black Colleges and Universities, more affordable 2 and 4-year college, and support for trade and vocational education."", 'Finally, today, my agenda includes the protection of religious liberty, the promotion of family, and support for the African-American church.', 'This is just the beginning. Because I will never, ever take the African-American community for granted. It will be my mission to prove to this country that yesterday does not have to be tomorrow. The cycle of poverty can be broken, and great new things can happen for our people.', ""But to achieve this future, we must reject the failed elites in Washington who've been wrong about virtually everything for decades."", 'The people opposing us promised that passing NAFTA, and opening our markets to China, would bring a new era of prosperity and job creation. Instead, they brought only poverty and heartache.', ""The people opposing us are the same people who've wasted $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that have produced only more terrorism, more death, and more suffering – imagine if that money had been spent at home."", 'My opponent unleashed ISIS on the world. She tried to build Democracy in Libya, and failed. She tried to build Democracy in Iraq, and failed. She tried regime change in Egypt, and failed. She pressed regime change in Syria, and failed. She tried a Russian Reset that failed. She tried an Asia Pivot that failed. Now, Hillary Clinton wants to confront nuclear-armed Russia with a shooting war in Syria that could lead us into World War III.', ""Finally, our opponents passed a healthcare law, embraced by Hillary Clinton, over the furious objections of the American voter. Obamacare is now destroying our healthcare system – premiums are skyrocketing double-digits and are surging by more than 100% in the great state of Arizona. Doctors are quitting, insurers are leaving, and companies are fleeing. Every prediction they made about this law was a lie. If we don't repeal and replace this disastrous law, we will lose our healthcare system forever."", 'Now is the time to embrace a New Direction.', ""I've been very lucky and have led a great life. Now I want to give back to the country which has been so good to me. I just left a hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C., delivered under budget, and ahead of schedule, creating thousands of jobs, including construction. It will be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world, and a great symbol for our country. I took two hours to fly into Washington, to cut the ribbon with my children, and then jump on the plane to be here with you. I wanted to be there for my children, who worked so hard on this hotel -- parents must stick with, encourage, and support their children. They did a great job on the hotel, and I told them so. Likewise, the workers did a magnificent job -- without them, it could never have been built so quickly and so beautifully. The rebuilding we did of the Old Post Office is the rebuilding I want to do for our country."", ""I want to go into the inner cities, the poor rural communities, and the failing schools, and I want to work on a national plan for revitalization. I'm tired of the excuses from our politicians. I'm tired of being told what can't be done. I'm tired of people asking Americans to defer their dreams to another day, but really another decade."", ""Enough waiting. The time is now. There is nothing we can't accomplish. There is no task or project too great. There is no dream outside our reach."", 'Everywhere I go in this country, all I see is untapped potential waiting to be set free. But we will never realize that potential if we continue putting our faith in a broken political system that has let us down time and again. We have to choose the more optimistic path – we have to choose to believe not in our politicians, but to believe in ourselves and in our country. If we do that, anything is possible.', ""I'm asking America to join me in dreaming big and bold things for our future. Let's close the history books on the failures in Washington, and let's open a new chapter of success and prosperity for everyone."", 'I am humbled beyond words to be the nominee for the Party of Abraham Lincoln. And it is my highest and greatest hope that the Republican Party can be the home of the African-American vote once again.', 'Together, we will have a government of, by and for the people.', 'And we will Make America Great Again For All Americans.']",1
