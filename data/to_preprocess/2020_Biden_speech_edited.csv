He refused to warn the American people. And again, last night, in a televised town hall, the President revealed in no uncertain terms the lack of seriousness with which he continues to take this pandemic.\n', 'Nearly eight months after this crisis on the doorstep of 200,000 American deaths, President Trump refused once again to take responsibility or to take action.\n', 'By his own admission he continued to lie about COVID-19. He doubled down on his catastrophic mistakes.\n', ""And, perhaps worst of all — he made clear that he still doesn't have a plan to bring us out of this crisis.\n"", 'He even said that quote — ""a lot of people think that masks are not good"" — undercutting the easiest and most effective means we have for reducing the spread of this disease.\n', 'This virus is still taking nearly a thousand lives each day.\n', 'And forecasts show that the numbers are likely to climb this winter.\n', ""But, incredibly, President Trump insists that he wouldn't have done anything differently.\n"", 'Not one thing.\n', 'Last Friday, we learned that another one thousand Americans died due to this virus.\n', 'On the very same day, Canada reported that not one person died of COVID-19.\n', ""And Trump wouldn't have done anything differently?\n"", ""If you're a parent in America, preparing for another day that you can't send your child to school, if you're grieving the loss of a loved one, if your small business can't open or you can't go back to work because the virus is still spreading in your community, how does it make you feel to hear the President say he wouldn't have done anything differently?\n"", 'And if he gets four more years, why should we expect anything to change?\n', ""All President Trump had to offer last night was the same weak and feckless inaction — the same lies and empty promises — that we've seen from the very beginning.\n"", ""He still won't accept responsibility. He still won't offer a plan.\n"", 'Last night, he repeated what he has said so many times before: That even if he continues to offer only failing indifference some day, the virus will go away like a miracle.\n', ""It won't go away like a miracle. The fact is, even if we get a vaccine, it will not be available to most of the population until well into next year.\n"", 'And we are heading into a dangerous autumn.\n', 'In fact, the University of Washington model — which the White House has previously touted — projects that cases and deaths are going to spike in November – and an additional 215,000 Americans will die by the end of the year.\n', ""That's more than have already died.\n"", 'We need leadership right now to prevent that from happening. That same University of Washington model shows that if there is universal masking, we could cut those deaths by more than half. We could save more than 100,000 lives.\n', 'Even Donald Trump\'s own director of the CDC told us that wearing a mask is the single most important step we can take to curb this virus. He said ""I might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine.""\n', 'I spoke with the experts today about additional steps we can take to prevent needless deaths and suffering.\n', 'Uniform national guidance – and standards on social distancing – that can be applied to the particular circumstances of states and communities.\n', 'More effective approaches on testing and tracing.\n', 'If we do these things between now and January – we could save even more lives.\n', 'Last night, Donald Trump indicated he has no interest in doing these things.\n', ""A president's first responsibility is to protect the American people.\n"", ""And he won't.\n"", 'That is utterly disqualifying.\n', 'I also spoke with the experts about the paramount importance of preparing now for the swift, organized, and free distribution of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine.\n', 'I am profoundly grateful to the scientists and researchers working tirelessly to ensure that\n', 'a safe and effective vaccine becomes a reality as soon as possible.\n', 'They carry the hopes of our entire nation and the entire world.\n', 'And when their work comes to fruition – and it will — they will no doubt save countless lives.\n', ""But scientific breakthroughs don't care about calendars any more than the virus does.\n"", ""They certainly don't adhere to election cycles.\n"", 'And their timing, their approval, and their distribution should never, ever be distorted by political considerations. They should be determined by science and safety alone.\n', 'A vaccine would offer a way back to normalcy and a path forward to better days for all of us.\n', ""It won't happen overnight. It will take months to distribute it to the entire population.\n"", ""But I'm more hopeful than ever in the power of science to get us there.\n"", 'One thing is certain, we cannot allow politics to interfere with a vaccine in any way.\n', ""Americans have had to endure President Trump's incompetence and dishonesty when it came to testing and personal protective equipment.\n"", 'We cannot afford a repeat of those fiascos when it comes to a vaccine. The stakes are too high American families have already suffered and sacrificed far too much.\n', ""So let me be clear, I trust vaccines. I trust the scientists. But I don't trust Donald Trump — and the American people can't either.\n"", 'Last week, Senator Harris and I laid out three questions this Administration must answer — to assure the American people that politics will play no role whatsoever in the vaccine process.\n', 'If Donald Trump can give honest answers to these questions — the American people should have the confidence and transparency they need to trust a vaccine and adopt it in numbers that make a difference.\n', 'First, what criteria will be used to ensure that a vaccine meets the scientific standard of safety and effectiveness?\n', 'Second, if the Administration greenlights a vaccine — who will validate that the decision was driven by science rather than politics?\n', 'Third, how can we be sure that the distribution of the vaccine will take place — safely, cost-free, and without a hint of favoritism?\n', 'The fact of the matter is developing a vaccine is only part of the battle.\n', 'Distributing a vaccine to the entire population is as complex and challenging as the most sensitive military operation.\n', ""I've been calling for an effective distribution plan for months.\n"", 'If I am elected president, I will begin implementing an effective distribution plan from the minute I take office. That is what I discussed with the experts in the briefing today.\n', 'It will include: a detailed timeline for when people will get the vaccine, a clear delineation of priority populations, the specific means and mechanisms of shipping and storage at appropriate temperatures, the division of responsibility at every level of government.\n', 'And I will provide the leadership necessary to carry this plan out. I will level with the American people. I will take responsibility. I will support rather than tear down the experts responsible for day-to-day execution. I will follow the science.\n', 'With satisfactory answers to the three questions I laid out — every American— including me and my family — can have confidence in a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine.\n', ""This isn't about politics. It's about saving lives.\n"", ""It's about getting back to our loved ones and our friends.\n"", ""It's about getting our economy back on its feet.\n"", 'Getting back to the movie theater, to the restaurant, to the ballpark.\n', ""It's about getting back to our lives — and getting America up off the mat.\n"", 'We can, and we must, be united in that pursuit.\n', 'No matter when that breakthrough emerges — no matter when that hope bears fruit.\n', ""That's America at our best.\n"", 'Thank you.\n', 'God bless our scientists and researchers — and frontline workers.\n', 'And God protect our troops.\n', ""I'll stop and take your questions.""]",1

It means a lot of people not able to see their parents so much.\n"", 'So my heart goes out to you and your sister as well -- her children. It is just incredible.\n', ""Look, there's three things we should be doing. Number one, we should make sure that we have national standards laid out so how people can in fact go to work safely and have a national standard. You can't mandate it. But as President of the United States, I'd lay out the broad strokes of what has to be done to make people safe in their workplace and safe in school.\n"", ""And that requires us to have rapid testing, the protective gear available from the very beginning -- like this President hasn't done -- making sure we provide for the ability for workplaces to have the wherewithal to provide for the safety that requires some Federal funding, particularly kids going back to school, making sure that we're in a position that there's testing and tracing and get testing quickly.\n"", ""There's a whole range of things we should have done. I laid it out all the way back in March how we should do that. The President is totally disregarded it.\n"", ""He continues to think that masks don't matter very much. He always says it and then he has these large gatherings with everybody around with no masks on, and it's extremely dangerous.\n"", ""And so there's a lot of people, a lot of people hurt.

The idea that you're going -- to not tell people what you've been told that this virus is incredibly contagious, seven times more contagious than the flu. You breathe the air, you get sucked into your lungs.\n"", ""What has he done? Imagine and -- by the way, Columbia University Medical School pointed out, if he had just acted one month, one week earlier, he would have saved 37,000 lives, all the way back -- and I was on one of your shows -- all the way back in March, I was calling for the need for us to have masks, have the President stand and tell us what's going on.\n"", 'But he knew it.

It\'s been extremely inconsistent. It\'s caused so many people in this country to ignore the virus and not take the necessary precautions.\n', 'How will you get the proper messaging out to all Americans to keep them informed as to how to properly protect themselves and others from this pandemic?\n', ""BIDEN: What Presidents say matter, people listen. I will make it clear what is needed to be done. I cannot mandate people wearing masks, but we just been told if we should expect another 215,000 dead by January.

You can save lives.\n"", ""And we should be providing for the PPE, the protective gear that is needed. Look, you know what recently happened? The President of the United States said that no longer would we in fact provide masks for schools -- for schools -- for them to have the mask in school, because it was not a national emergency. What is he talking about? It's totally irrational.\n"", ""And look, this is all about one thing, the stock market. He didn't want to see anything happen.

He said, if in fact, you just wore this mask, nothing else, but this mask, you would save between now and January, another hundred thousand lives.\n"", ""And so we have to be honest with the American people. They're tough. They know as Franklin Roosevelt said, things get worse and worse before they get better and better.

This President should step down.\n"", ""COOPER: Mr. Vice President, you've called the President's rallies irresponsible. Yet you praised peaceful protesting this summer? What is the difference when it comes to COVID safety?\n"", ""BIDEN: I think COVID safety is a problem no matter where people are wearing masks, if they're not -- if they don't have masks on. The context of praising people who protest peacefully, is -- there was a question of right to speak, not to loot, not to burn, not to do anything that causes damage.\n"", 'The right to speak out makes sense, but we should be careful across the board -- across the board, in terms of -- but there is a big difference between people walking, moving along, and people sitting down cheek to jowl, shoulder to shoulder, a thousand of them breathing on one another indoors and out that causes real serious problem.\n', ""COOPER: You've said about a month ago that for the next three months, all Americans should -- you'd like to see all Americans wearing masks.\n"", 'BIDEN: Yes.\n', ""COOPER: And that you would push governors to institute mandates for mask wearing. Back in the pandemic in 1918, in some states, in some towns, they had actually outdoor courts to find people who weren't wearing masks. Is that something you would like to see happen in states?\n"", 'BIDEN: I would like to see the governors enforce mask wearing. Period. I can do that on Federal property.\n', ""As President, I will do that. On Federal land, I'd have the authority. If you're on Federal land, you must wear a mask.

There's no question that it saves people lives.\n"", 'COOPER: To those who say it is individual liberty not to wear a mask.\n', ""BIDEN: Well, let me tell you something, you know I -- what Bill Barr recently said is outrageous.

Joe, look, first of all, I don't trust the President on vaccines. I trust Dr. Fauci. If Fauci says the vaccine is safe, I take the vaccine. Now, we should listen to the scientists, not to the President, number one.\n"", ""Number two, I think we should be requiring that you have -- it's estimated by superintendents around the country in order to make schools safe for returning, we need to spend about $200 billion to do that, to sanitize, to provide for more teachers on smaller classes and smaller mods, making sure the ventilation systems are functioning, dealing across the board to make it safer so that schools when they open, they are safer.\n"", ""But with regard to you, you should be in a position where if in fact the vaccine -- there's no vaccine that's going to be guaranteed 100 percent, so you're going to have a tough decision you have to make and whether or not where you should be able to be in a position where you are behind plastic, you are in a sanitized circumstance and you are teaching.\n"", ""I would not take the chance, even if everyone had been vaccinated because of your compromised immune system.

She's been teaching her whole life and she plans on teaching at least one course, if we win as the First Lady in the Community College she's taught at.\n"", 'And so one of the things we have to do is make sure you are protected. The teachers are protected. But also students have access to the protection.\n', 'COOPER: Let me ask you, vaccine policy in schools is really done by states and localities.

It depends on the state of the vaccine. I've been briefed by seven of the leading folks in the nation as of two days ago.\n"", ""And there's variations, some of them are arguing it can take care -- an increase by 40 to 50 to 60 percent that you won't get through COVID virus, but no guarantee beyond that.

So I would mandate that children have to take your vaccine until they do that and they're telling me that won't happen and be able to happen with -- by the numbers until sometime in the middle of 2021.\n"", 'COOPER: You said you trust Fauci, do you trust the head of the F.D.A., the current head of the F.D.A., the current head of the C.D.C., and would you keep them in their positions?\n', ""BIDEN: Well, it's premature for me to say that. All I know is that the rank and file people, the scientists in each of those agencies are solid, and they're serious. But you've seen how the President has tried to push things through and put a lot of pressure on them.\n"", ""I'm impressed by the head of the C.D.C. now standing up and saying to the Mr. President, wearing this mask -- wearing this mask is going to save more lives than the vaccine between now and the end of the year.\n"", ""COOPER: Mr. Vice President, this is Sheila Schaufler, a registered nurse from Scranton.

There are many frontline workers who are making much less than people on unemployment, who have benefited from the extra $600.00 in stimulus payments. I have personally spoken to people who refuse to even look or apply for jobs because of the extra money. What is your plan to get Americans back to work and off the government payroll?\n', ""BIDEN: First of all, I have a plan to deal with the need for additional healthcare workers and pay them a wage that is a living wage that's real.

15,            Joseph R. Biden          ,"October 15, 2020","['STEPHANOPOULOS: Good evening. From the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, our town hall with Joe Biden starts right now.', 'And welcome to our town hall with Joe Biden.', 'Mr. Vice President, welcome to you.', 'BIDEN: Good to be with you.', ""STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, we're here with a group of Pennsylvania voters. You can see, they are all appropriately socially distanced tonight. [laughter]"", 'BIDEN: Yeah.', ""STEPHANOPOULOS: And they're a group of -- some are voting for you, some have said they're voting for President Trump, some are still undecided, and we're going to try to take questions from as many as we can tonight."", 'BIDEN: OK.', ""STEPHANOPOULOS: And we're going to start with Nicholas Feden. He's from Jenkintown, Pennsylvania. It's close to you here in Philadelphia."", 'And --', 'BIDEN: Hello.', ""STEPHANOPOULOS: -- you're a Democrat?"", 'NICK FEDEN: I am a Democrat. Thank you, George.', 'Mr. Vice President, every day, my wife and I are in disbelief at the lack of coordinated federal action on COVID-19. We know that your administration would follow the science.', 'My question for you is two parts. First, looking backwards to when this country first became aware of COVID-19, what would following the science have meant in terms of actual policy?', ""And then, looking forward, what would your administration do in terms of following the science with real concrete policies that haven't been done by the current administration?"", 'BIDEN: Well, first of all, going back, the fact is that we -- the president was informed how dangerous this virus was. And all the way back in the beginning of February, I argued that we should be keeping people in China.', ""And we had set up in our administration a pandemic office within the White House, there were 44 people on the ground. I suggested we should be seeking, and I didn't hold public office, I was a former vice president, I suggested we, in fact, ask -- to have access to the source of the problem."", 'And to the best of our knowledge, Trump never pushed that. All those 44 people came home, never got replaced.', 'In addition to that, I pointed out that I thought in February, I did a piece for ""USA Today"" saying this is a serious problem. Trump denied it. He said it wasn\'t.', ""We later learned that he knew full well how serious it was when he did an interview with George Woodward -- I mean, excuse me, Bob Woodward. And at the time, he said he didn't tell anybody because he was afraid Americans would panic."", ""Americans don't panic. He panicked. He didn't say a word to anybody."", ""Then I wrote a piece in March about what I thought we should be doing to take hold of this, using the -- there's an act that was passed a long time ago that allows the president to go into a business and say, stop making this and start making that, and took a long time for him to even institute that to get ventilators and so on."", ""And so, the point was, he missed enormous opportunities and kept saying things that weren't true. It's going to go away by Easter, don't worry about it. It's all going to -- when the heat -- when summer comes, it's all going to go away like a miracle. He's still saying those things."", ""STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. Vice President, before you go to the future, can I follow back on looking back for just a little bit? You did have an op-ed in January where you warned of the seriousness of the pandemic. But there's no record of you calling for social distancing, limited social gatherings, mandatory mask -- [crosstalk]"", 'BIDEN: Not back then.', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: In January or February? Right.', ""BIDEN: No, in January and February, no, that's correct. There wasn't."", 'That came at the end of March, and then I laid out a detailed plan relative to school openings in June and July and talked about -- but you got -- by that time, the science was becoming clearer and clearer of how this was spreading so rapidly.', 'But the president kept denying that. If you notice, from March on, I stopped doing big meetings, I started wearing masks, you know? So, it was at a time when the science was saying and his key people, Dr. Fauci, were saying, you should be taking these precautions.', ""So, what we should be doing now, there should be a national standard. Instead of leaving this up to -- remember, the president said to the governors, well, they're on their own. It's not my responsibility. The governors can do what they need to do. Not my responsibility."", ""It is the presidential responsibility to lead. And he didn't do that. He didn't talk about what needed to be done because he kept worrying, in my view, about the stock market. He worried if he talked about how bad this could be unless we took these precautionary actions then in fact the market would be done."", ""And his barometer of success of the economy is the market. Thirdly, what we didn't do is the president had an opportunity to open and allow schools and businesses to stay open if he -- they got the kind of help they needed."", ""So the Congress passed a couple trillion dollars worth of help and what happened was most of that money -- significant portion of that money went to the very wealthiest corporations in the country, didn't get to the mom and pop stores."", ""So you had one in five, one in six minority businesses closing, many of them permanently, people being laid off. And then what happened was when the first tranche of -- the first round of money for unemployment -- enhanced unemployment passed -- went -- went by, he didn't do anything. He didn't do anything."", ""And to the best of my knowledge, and I mean this sincerely, I can't think of -- I've been around for a lot of presidents and you know a lot of presidents in a crisis -- I don't ever remember one never calling the House and Senate Republicans and Democrats together."", ""STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's look forward a little bit. You said that you would lock down the economy only if the scientist said it was necessary."", ""BIDEN: But that wasn't the context. They said would I lock down the -- the economy is science said so. I said I'd follow science. What I -- but I don't think there's a need to lock down."", 'STEPHANOPOULOS: But -- yes, but I want to press you on that point there.', 'BIDEN: Sure.', ""STEPHANOPOULOS: You -- you've been in the Oval Office for eight years with President Obama. He would always say that only the -- only the hard to solve problems ...[crosstalk]... said what is most likely to happen is the scientist will disagree. The scientist will disagree with the economist. So the question is how are you going to decide this? Who are you going to listen to and how can you contain the pandemic without crushing the economy?"", 'BIDEN: Well, you can contain the pandemic by being rational and not trust the economy. For example, I laid out a plan how you can open businesses. You can open businesses and schools if in fact you provide them the guidance that they need as well as the money to be able to do it.', ""What's happening now is we know, for example, if you can open a business and you could have a sign on the door saying safe to come in, that's why people aren't going anyway when they're open."", ""And say because you have social distancing and you have plastic barriers when you go to the cashier you have separators between the booths, you don't have large crowds, you reduce the size of the number of people you can have in the restaurant."", ""You make sure there's testing. That's a really critical piece that he didn't do, testing and tracing. And you make sure that people are equipped going to schools. You know we initially said -- the government initially said they're going to provide masks for every student and every teacher."", ""And then they said no, no, no, no; FEMA said that -- the president or whomever said no, no that's not a national emergency. Not a national emergency. We need fewer -- we need more teachers in our schools to be able to open, smaller pods."", ""We need ventilation systems change. There's a lot of things we know now and I've let -- I laid them out in some detail. Now again, when I say I laid them out, I'm not an office holder. I'm running for office, it's not like I'm still vice president or I was a United States senator pushing this."", ""So I don't want to say I, I, I. But we did lay out exactly what needed to be done. And take a look, we make up 4 percent of the world's population, we have 20 percent of the world's deaths."", ""We're in a situation where we have 210 plus thousand people dead. And what's he doing? Nothing. He's still not wearing a mask and so on."", ""STEPHANOPOULOS: We're getting some other questions on COVID."", 'BIDEN: Sure.', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: The next one comes from Kelly Leigh.', 'BIDEN: Thank you.', ""STEPHANOPOULOS: She's from Philadelphia, Republican. Voted for Donald Trump in 2016. Undecided now."", 'KELLY LEIGH: I did.', 'BIDEN: Hey, Kelly, how are you?', ""LEIGH: Hi, Mr. Biden. My question is about the coronavirus vaccine or potential. Senator Harris stated that she absolutely would not take a vaccine from President Trump. And of course we all know it's not President Trump that would create this vaccine, it would be doctors and scientist that presumably we all trust."", 'So my question for you is if a vaccine were approved by -- between now and the end of the year, would you take it and if you were to become president, would you mandate that everyone has to take it.', ""BIDEN: Two things. Number one, President Trump talks about things that just aren't accurate about everything from vaccines; we're going to have one right away, it's going to happen and so on. The point is that if the scientist -- if the body of science is saying that this is what is ready to be done and they're -- it's been tested and they've gone through the three phases; yes, I would take it and I'd encourage people to take it."", ""But President Trump says things like, you know, everything from this crazy stuff he's walking away from now, inject bleach in your arm and that's going to work. No, I'm not being a bit -- I'm not being facetious though. I mean he actually said these things. And now Regeneron is the answer. That's going to cure everything."", ""There's 500,000 doses. We got a couple -- you know, we have a -- more than a few million people."", ""You know, and so -- and most of the -- if you notice, most of the companies who are developing these vaccines are working. They're making real progress."", ""I meet with four leading scientists at least twice a week, in the beginning, four times a week, giving us the detail on what kind of progress is being made. And, right now, they do the right thing. When they run into a serious problem, they halt the test. They don't continue until they figure out what the problem was."", ""They're not there yet. And most scientists say that it's not likely to have a vaccine that would be available until the beginning of next year, into the spring of next year."", 'And, in the meantime, what I worry about is the same thing with Regeneron, which is -- which is a useful antidote -- not antidote -- a useful tool.', ""But what's happening is, there is no plan to figure out how to distribute it, how many -- we have 500,000 vials of it. Well, we don't have all the testing equipment. We don't have all the ability to get it to the people who need it."", ""And what we should be doing now -- and, allegedly, it's happening, but I have not seen it yet, nor the docs that I talk to have seen it -- there should be a plan, when we have the vaccine, how do we distribute it?"", 'STEPHANOPOULOS: And once we get it, if it is safe, if it is effective, will you mandate its use?', ""BIDEN: The answer is, depending on how clear there's -- vaccines, they say, have a very positive impact, and they are going to affect positively 85 percent of the American public."", ""There's others that say, this vaccine is really the key. This is -- this is the golden key."", ""It depends on the state of the nature of the vaccine when it comes out and how it's being distributed. That would depend on."", 'But I would think that we should be talking about -- depending on the continuation of the spread of the virus, we should be thinking about making it mandatory.', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: How could you enforce that?', ""BIDEN: Well, you couldn't. That's the problem, just like can't enforce -- you can't enforce measles. You can't come to school until you have a measles shot. You can't."", ""But you can't say, everyone has to do this. But you would -- just like you can't mandate a mask. But you can say -- you can go to every governor and get them all in a room, all 50 of them, as president, and say, ask people to wear the mask. Everybody knows."", ""STEPHANOPOULOS: And if they don't, fine?"", ""BIDEN: If they don't, no, not fine."", ""Then I go to every governor -- I go to every mayor, I go to every councilman, I go to every local official, say, mandate the mask, man -- say, this is what you have to do when you're out. Make sure you encourage it being done."", 'Look, George, you and I know -- and I think you do, too, as well -- the words of a president matter.', 'LEIGH: Absolutely.', ""BIDEN: No matter whether they're good, bad or indifferent, they matter."", ""And when a president doesn't wear a mask, or makes fun of folks, like me, when I was wearing a mask for a long time, then people say, well, it mustn't be that important."", 'But when a president says, I think this is very important -- for example, I walked in here with this mask, but I have one of the N95 masks underneath it. And I left it in the -- in my dressing room -- the dressing room -- the room I was in before I got here.', 'And so I think it matters what we say.', ""And we're now learning that children are getting the virus, not with as serious consequences, but we haven't -- there's been no studies done yet on vaccines for children."", ""So, there's a long way to go, but we can make progress in the meantime and save lives."", ""And the last point I'll make, if you listen to the head of the CDC, he stood up, and he said, you know, while we're waiting for a vaccine -- and he held up a mask -- you wear this mask, you will save more lives between now and the end of the year than if we had a vaccine, than if we had a vaccine."", 'It is estimated, by every major study done from the University of Washington to Columbia that if, in fact, we wore masks, we could save between now and the end of the year 100,000 lives.', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: And avoid lockdowns?', 'BIDEN: And avoid lockdown, yes.', ""You don't have to lock down if you are wearing the mask."", ""STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's get a question on the economy."", 'Anthony Argirakis...', 'BIDEN: Thank you.', 'I hope I answered your question.', ""STEPHANOPOULOS: ... from Canonsburg, Pennsylvania -- it's a suburb of Pittsburgh -- Republican."", 'BIDEN: I know it.', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: Voted for President Trump.', 'ANTHONY J. ARGIRAKIS: Thank you, George.', 'Thank you, Mr. Vice President.', 'You stated that anyone making less than $400,000 will not see one single penny of their taxes raised...', ""BIDEN: That's right."", 'ARGIRAKIS: ... but also state that you are going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts.', 'The Trump tax cuts reduces taxes for the majority of workers, I would argue not enough.', 'What is your plan for either extending the tax cuts for the middle class or creating a new plan that further reduces those taxes?', 'BIDEN: I carry this card with me.', ""When I said the tax -- the Trump tax cuts, about $1.3 trillion of the $2 trillion in his tax cuts went to the top one-tenth of 1 percent. That's what I'm talking about eliminating, not all the tax cuts that are out there."", 'And, by the way, if you just take a look, we reduced the corporate tax rate from 35 percent and Democrats and Republicans who were in office thought it should come down to 28 percent. He reduced it to 21 percent.', ""You have 91 out of every -- of the Fortune 500 companies not paying a single solitary penny. If you raise the corporate taxes back to 28 percent, which is a fair tax, you'd raise $1 trillion 300 billion by that one act."", 'If you made sure that people making over $400 grand pay what they did in the Bush Administration, 39.6 percent, you would raise another -- this goes up to, let me get to the exact number here. About another $200-- excuse me. $92 billion.', ""So you could raise a lot of money to be able to invest in things that can make your life easier, make you change your standard of living by making sure you have affordable healthcare, by making sure you're in a situation where you're able to send your kind to school, and if you have a student debt, you can deal with it. Making sure that your home, that you can pay your mortgage."", 'We have 29 million people right now . . .', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. Vice President, let me press you on that.', 'BIDEN: Sure.', ""STEPHANOPOULOS: You're going to raise the corporate tax. You're going to raise taxes on the wealthy."", 'Is it wise to do even that when the economy is as weak as it is right now? Another . . .', 'BIDEN: Absolutely.', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: . . . 900,000 people . . .', ""BIDEN: That's a great question."", ""Moody's did an analysis of my -- detailed analysis of my tax plan and my economic plan. They said I will, in four years -- Moody's. Wall Street. Said I will create 18.6 million new jobs, good paying jobs, number one. Number two, and I'll -- the GDP will grow by a trillion dollars more than it would under Trump, and seven million more jobs than under Trump'"", ""And the reason is, when you allow people to get back in the game and have a job, everything moves. Everything moves. Right now, you've got the opposite."", 'You had, last year, during this pandemic, you had the wealthiest billionaires in the world, and the nation, they made another $700 billion. Seven hundred billion dollars.', ""He talks about a V-shaped recovery. It's a K-shaped recovery. If you're on the top, you're going to do very well. And the other things I'm -- and if you're on the bottom or if you're in the middle or the bottom, your income is coming down. You're not getting a raise. I should -- I don't know what you're doing. You may get a raise."", ""Hope you're a billionaire, I -- but, but all kidding aside, it's about growing the economy. And, George, the way out, the reason why I'm so optimistic about economic recovery, more than I've ever been, is we have these four crises happening all at once and one helps the other."", ""For example, we're going to invest a great deal of that money into infrastructure. And into green infrastructure. We're going to put 500,000 charging stations on new highways we're building, and old highways we're building. We're going to own the electric market."", 'You know as well as I do, from your days -- you know, in the old days, where the president has -- spends about $600 billion a year on government contracts, everything from making sure they have aircraft carriers to automobile fleets for the -- in the United States.', ""If you make -- make -- and we can -- and it's not in violation of any international trade agreement, made in America. If you actually insist that, whatever that product is, made in America, including the material that goes into the product, we -- it's estimated we're going to create somewhere between another 4 million and 6 million jobs just by doing that."", ""But what's happening now under his trade policy, a lot of this is going overseas. You get a benefit from going overseas, if you have much of it being made overseas. So, if you send it overseas, you get a 10 percent tax increase on your-- on the product."", ""If you make it in America and you bring it back, you get a 10 percent growth. If you bring back a company and you're going to open up an old facility, you get a 10 percent tax credit for all you invested. That actually works, George."", ""STEPHANOPOULOS: So, there's not going to be any delay on the tax increases."", 'BIDEN: No, well, I\'ve got to get the votes. I got to get the votes. That\'s why -- you know, the one thing that I -- I have this strange notion. We are a democracy. Some of my Republican friends and some of my Democratic friends even occasionally say, ""Well, if you can\'t get the votes by executive order, you\'re going to do something."" Things you can\'t do by executive order unless you\'re a dictator. We\'re a democracy. We need consensus.', ""STEPHANOPOULOS: We've got to take a quick break. We'll be right back."", 'BIDEN: I hope I answered your question.', '[commercial break]', ""STEPHANOPOULOS: And welcome back to our Town Hall with Joe Biden.

You look like you're way up there."", ""CEDRIC HUMPHREY: I'll be OK. Thank you, George. And good evening, Former Vice President Biden."", 'BIDEN: Good evening.', ""HUMPHREY: Many people believe that the true swing demographic in this election will be Black voters under the age of 30. Not because they'll be voting for Trump, but because they won't vote at all. I myself have had this exact same conflict."", ""So, my question for you then is, besides you ain't Black, what do you have to say to young Black voters who see voting for you as further participation in a system that continually fails to not protect them?"", ""BIDEN: Well, I'd said, first of all, as my buddy John Lewis said, it's a sacred opportunity, the right to vote. You can make a difference."", 'If young Black women and men vote, you can determine the outcome of this election. Not a joke. You can do that.', ""And the next question is, am I worthy of your vote, can I earn your vote? And the answer is, there's two things I think that I care, that I've demonstrated I care about my whole career. One is in addition to dealing with a criminal justice system to make it fair and make it more decent, we have to be able to put Black Americans in a position to be able to gain wealth, generate wealth and so you look at what that entails and it entails everything from early education; that's why I'm supporting making sure that when you have Title One Schools as you know schools with the least tax base to be able to support their schools, I increased the funding for them from 15 to $45 billion. That allows every teacher in that school to make up to 60,000 bucks and the problem now is they're leaving the schools, they're not there, we're short about a million-and-a-half teachers, a million-and-a-quarter teachers."", ""Number two, every three and four and five-year-old will go to school; school not daycare, school. And all the great universities including the one you've gone to, go to or went to, in fact talks about in the last eight years what's happened, what happens when you let them go to school they make up rapidly whatever shortcoming they had in terms of their education prior to that. They've not heard as many words spoken, etc., etc."", ""What happens is that the studies show that 58 percent will increase by 58 percent their chance of going all through 12 years of school and going through successfully. We'll also provide for the ability to bring in social workers and school psychologists. We have one school psychologist in America now for every 1507 kids; it should be one to 500, not just in schools that are poor but in all schools because we learn that for example drug abuse doesn't cause mental illness; mental illness cause drug abuse.

The federal government spends billions of dollars a year on universities because they are the best kept secret or where most of the major inventions come out of and so that school now will be able to produce young Black women and men who are going to go into a field of the future that's burgeoning; cybersecurity.

So what President Obama and I did, we had a program, we took $1,500,000,000 and we invested it in all the SBAs around the country, in the state SBAs, Small Business Associations and that generated, $30 billion came off the sideline because if you have a guarantee of $200,000 for your new startup enterprise, you're an entrepreneur, you're going to be able to attract if it's government money, there's a guarantee you'll be to attract another $100,000. It generated $30 billion."", ""Now I'm changing that program and I'll get this done without much trouble I believe in the Congress from $1.5 billion to 30 billion.

The reason is that that has not been mastered yet. I met a lot of people in Silicon Valley; the battery technology's increasing significantly so you're going to be able to have for example solar on your home and a battery the size, this-by this-by this, as I'm showing you here, in your basement so when the sun doesn't shine for five days you still have enough energy."", ""So we're making significant progress.
