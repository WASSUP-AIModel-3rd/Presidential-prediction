It's great to be back in the Sunshine State!\xa0 To Governor Desantis, Senator Rubio, Senator Scott, members of Congress, members of the amazing Trump family, [Cheering.] and my fellow Americans here in Orlando and all across this country, Karen and I are thrilled to be with you tonight. But, we're here for one reason, and one reason only. \xa0America needs four more years of President Donald Trump. [Cheering.] I"", ""It's on, everybody. Time for round two. The 503 day campaign for America's future starts tonight. [Cheering.] It's amazing to think about it, what began four years ago this week, it's grown into a movement, a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. You believed we could be strong again. You believed we could be prosperous again."", ""And in President Donald Trump you found a leader who believed in you. [Cheering.] I don't have to tell any of you gathered here, President Donald Trump is the real deal. [Cheering.] He's a man who says what he means, and means what he says. And he gets up every day and fights to keep the promises we made to the American people. He said we'd make America great again, and that is exactly what we've done in just two and a half short years. [Cheering.]"", 'I mean, think about it. He promised to rebuild our military, and President Trump signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. [Cheering.] He promised to stand up to our enemies and stand with our allies, and under this commander-in-chief, our armed forces captured every last inch of ISIS territory.', ""And, this President kept the promise made by four of his predecessors when he moved our embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the state of Israel. [Cheering.] He promised our veterans, the real-time world-class health care that you earned in the uniform of the United States, and President Donald Trump delivered. We reformed the VA and Veteran's Choice is now the law. And this President has given the men and women of law enforcement the resources and the respect that they deserve every day. [Cheering.] Violent crime is down, and under the President's leadership we're waging an unprecedented fight against opioid abuse and addiction, all across America. And, of course, under President Trump's leadership we made historic investments to secure our southern border. [Cheering.]"", 'CROWD:\xa0 Build that wall!\xa0 Build that wall!\xa0', ""THE VICE PRESIDENT:\xa0 We've supported customs and border protection. We've stood by the courageous men and women of ICE. And thanks to the President's stance, Mexico has done more to secure our border in the last 10 days then the Democrats in Congress have done in the last 10 years. [Cheering.] And with President Trump's national emergency declaration, we've already started to build that wall. [Cheering.]"", ""And President Trump kept his word, when he's appointed more principled conservatives to our federal courts in the last two years than any President in American history. [Cheering.] And they are all men and women who will uphold all of the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution, like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms. [Cheering.] And while leading voices in the Democratic Party advocate late term abortion and eveb defend infanticide. . . \xa0[Booing.]. . .I couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. [Cheering.]"", ""And beyond all that, President Trump promised to revive the American economy by rollin' back red tape, unleashin' American energy, fightin' for fair trade deals and cuttin' taxes. And, President Trump delivered: \xa05.8 million new jobs since Election Day, and the unemployment rate has hit a 50 year low. [Cheering.] More Americans are workin' today than ever before. And the truth is that jobs are back. Confidence is back. And thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump, America is back. And we're just getting' started. [Cheering.] That's what we call promises made, and promises kept. But, to keep America great, we've to reelect the President who has been fighting for you every day. We've done so much, but there's much more to do. That's why we need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. [Cheering.]"", 'CROWD:\xa0 Four more years!\xa0\xa0 Four more years!', ""THE VICE PRESIDENT:\xa0 Four more years means more jobs. More judges. Mmore support for our troops. [Cheering.] And it's gonna take at least four more years to drain that swamp. [Cheering.] You know, the choice in this election couldn't be clearer, and the stakes couldn't be higher. Today we've a President who loves this country, who never quits, who never backs down, who believes in you and fights for you. And President Donald Trump believes in freedom. [Cheering.]"", 'In the other party, their candidates believe in more taxes, more regulation, and less freedom. Today, Democrats openly advocate socialism. [Booing.] An economic system that has impoverished millions of people around the world and stole the liberties of generations. It was freedom, not socialism that gave us the most prosperous economy in the history of the world. It was freedom, not socialism, that ended slavery, won two World Wars and stands today as the beacon of hope for all the world. The moment America becomes a socialist country is the moment America ceases to be America. So, as the President said in his State of the Union address, so we must say with one voice, America will never be a socialist country. [Cheers and applause.] \xa0', ""The choice in this election will not just be between two candidates. It'll be a choice between two futures. A future of more freedom or a future of more government. You know, on election night 2016, then President-elect Donald Trump promised in his words to be a President for all Americans. And I know he meant it from the bottom of his heart. So tonight, we appeal to all Americans. If you are doing better than you were three years ago, if your values are being better defended, if you are proud to have a President who fights for you and always puts America first, join us. Reelect President Donald Trump and we will keep America great. [Cheers and applause] "", ""Now the pollsters and pundits say our task won't be easy, just like they said before. But you all know better. We made history in 2016, and we're going to make history again in 2020 when we reelect the 45th President of the United States for four more years. So as the campaign begins, I encourage you, bring all of your enthusiasm. And have faith. Faith that when our fellow Americans are given a choice between freedom, more freedom, and more government, they choose freedom every time."", ""Have faith in this President, whose drive and vision are making America great again even as we speak. And have faith, have faith that he who blessed this one nation under God will yet bless America. [Cheers and applause.] And I know that with your ongoing support and energy in the next 503 days, we will reelect this President. And with President Donald Trump in the White House for four more years, and with God's help, we will make America safe again, we'll make America prosperous again, and this President will make America greater than ever before. [Cheers and applause.] "", ""But you don't have to take my word for it. Because now it's our high honor and distinct privilege to introduce to you our friends the First Lady and the 45th President of the United States of America, First Lady Melania and President Donald Trump. [Cheers and applause.] \xa0"", '[Lee Greenwood singing ""Born in the USA.""]', 'CROWD:\xa0 USA!\xa0 USA!', 'FIRST LADY MELANIA TRUMP:\xa0 Good evening Orlando.\xa0 It has been my honor to serve as First Lady of this incredible country for the past two years. [Cheers and applause.] ', ""And I'm excited to do it for six more. I am proud of all that my husband, this Administration, and our entire family have done on behalf of the American people in such a short time. [Cheers and applause.] He truly loves this country and will continue to work on your behalf as long as he can. All of us will. Thank you all again for being here tonight. Now, I want to introduce my husband, the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. [Cheers and applause.] "", 'CROWD:\xa0 USA!\xa0 USA!', ""PRESIDENT TRUMP: Ahh, we had such luck in Orlando. We love being in Orlando. Thank you, thank you, Orlando!\xa0 What a turnout. What a turnout.\xa0 You know, I said, this is a very big arena. For a Tuesday night. I said, you know, if we've about three or four empty seats, the fake news will say headlines: he did not fill up the arena. So, I said, maybe we should not take the chance. Maybe we shouldn't go to Orlando, we should go somewhere else. But I said no, I think we will go to Orlando. [Applause.] "", 'And. . . and not only did we fill it up, but we had 120,000 requests. [Applause.] \xa0That means you folks have come out very, very good. Congratulations.', ""I want to thank our great Vice President Mike Pence and his wonderful wife Karen Pence and our magnificent First Lady, Melania. Thank you. [Applause.] I am thrilled to be back in my second home. That's what it's, it's my second home. In many cases I think I can say it's my first home, you want to know the truth. It's the great state of Florida."", ""Very historic because exactly four years ago this week I announced my campaign for President of the United States. And it turned out to be more than just a political campaign. It turned out to be a great political movement. Because of you.\xa0 A great movement.\xa0 It's a movement made up of hard-working patriots who love their country, love their flag, love their children, and who believe that a nation must care for its own citizens first. [Cheers and applause.] "", ""Together we stared down a corrupt and broken political establishment, and we restored government of, by, and for the people. Our country is now thriving, prospering, and booming, and frankly, it's soaring to incredible new heights. [Cheers and applause.] "", ""Our economy is the envy of the world, perhaps the greatest economy we've had in the history of our country. [Cheers and applause.] And, as long as you keep this team in place, we've a tremendous way to go. Our future has never ever looked brighter or sharper. The fact is, the American dream is back, it's bigger and better and stronger than ever before. [Applause.] "", '2016 was not merely another four-year election. This was a defining moment in American history. Ask them right there. [Points to media.] [Laughter.] [Booing.] ', 'CROWD:\xa0 CNN Sucks!\xa0 CNN Sucks!\xa0 CNN Sucks!', ""By the way, that is a lot of fake news back there. [Cheers, applause, booing.]\xa0 That's, that's a lot."", ""You know what I say? The amount of press we've tonight reminds me of the Academy Awards before it went political and their ratings went down the tubes. [Applause.] "", 'This was our chance to reclaim our government from a permanent political class that enriched itself at your expense. As I said on a wonderful beautiful day at my inauguration, we did not merely transfer power from one party to another. But, we transferred power back to you, the proud citizens of the United States of America. [Cheers and applause.] ', 'CROWD:\xa0 USA!\xa0 USA!', ""We stared down the unholy alliance of lobbyists, and donors, and special interests who made a living bleeding our country dry, that's what we've done. We broke down the doors of Washington back rooms where deals were cut to close our companies, give away your jobs, shut down our factories, and surrender your sovereignty and your very way of life. And we've ended it. We took on a political machine that tried to take away your voice and your vote. They tried to take away your dignity and your destiny. But we will never let them do that, will we? Many times I said we would drain the swamp. That is exactly what we're doing right now. We're draining the swamp. [Applause.] "", 'CROWD:\xa0 Drain the swamp!\xa0 Drain the swamp!', ""THE PRESIDENT:\xa0 And that's why the swamp is fighting back so viciously and violently. For the last two and a half years, we have been under siege. And with the Mueller Report, we won, and now they want a do-over. They want a do-over. Let's do it again. Didn't work out too well. Let's do it again. They want a do-over. No President should ever have to go through this again. It is so bad for our great country. A hoax. A great hoax. Our patriotic movement has been under assault from the very first day. We accomplished more than any other President has in the first two and a half years of a presidency and under circumstances that no President has had to deal with before, because we did in the middle of a great and illegal witch-hunt, things that nobody has been able to accomplish. Not even close. Nobody's done what we've done in two and a half years. [Cheers and applause.] "", 'We went through the greatest witch-hunt in political history. The only collusion was committed by the Democrats, the fake news media, and their operatives, and the people who funded the phony dossier--crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC. It was all an illegal attempt to overturn the results of the election, spy on our campaign, which is what they did, and subvert our democracy. Remember, the insurance policy, just in case Hillary Clinton lost. Remember the insurance policy.', 'CROWD:\xa0 Lock her up! Lock her up!', 'THE PRESIDENT:\xa0 They appointed 18 very angry Democrats to try to take down our incredible movement. After two years, 1.4 million pages of documents, 500 search warrants, 500 witnesses, 2800 subpoenas, and 40 FBI Agents working round the clock, what did they come up with? No collusion. And the fact that led our great Attorney General to determine no obstruction. No collusion, no obstruction. And they spent $40 million on this witch-hunt. $40 million. [Booing.]', ""That's right. They spent $40 million, probably a hell of a lot more than that. And think about it. Nobody's been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. Nobody. [Applause.] "", ""We call it the Russian hoax. Remember President Obama's famous lines caught on the open mic secretly telling the Russian president to, quote, inform Vladimir that after my election, I will have more flexibility, ok? Remember that? Remember that?\xa0 A lot of people remember that. I remembered it. I saw it happen. I didn't like it. They don't bring it up. The fake news will never bring it up. [Booing.] "", ""And in September, just before the election, the FBI told President Obama about possible Russian interference and he did nothing because he thought that Hillary Clinton, crooked Hillary, was going to win. That's why he did nothing. [Booing.] "", ""He did nothing. I built up the military, imposed sanctions on Russia, and provided alternative energy sources for all over Europe that competed very, very strongly with Russia. We are, by the way, the number one producer of energy in the world because of what we've done right now. [Applause.] "", 'CROWD:\xa0 USA!\xa0 USA!', ""THE PRESIDENT: The Democrats don't care about Russia. They only care about their own political power. They went after my family, my business, my finances, my employees, almost everyone that I've ever known or worked with, but they are really going after you. That's what it's all about. It's not about us. It's about you. They tried to erase your votes, erase your legacy of the greatest campaign and the greatest election probably in the history of our country. [Cheers and applause.] "", 'And they wanted to deny you the future that you demanded, and the future that America deserves, and that now, America is getting. [Applause.]', ""Our radical Democrat opponents are driven by hatred, prejudice, and rage. They want to destroy you and they want to destroy our country as we know it. Not acceptable. It's not going to happen. [Applause.] Not gonna happen."", ""To understand Democrats' ruthless tactics, look no further than the United States Supreme Court and our court system nationwide. I will soon have appointed my 145th judge. [Cheers and applause.] "", 'President Obama was very nice to us. He didn\'t fill the positions. I get there the first day. How many judges do I have to appoint? They said, ""Sir, 139."" now, it\'s 145. And we just finished number 107, already approved, sitting on the bench. How about that? [Applause.] ', ""And by the time we're finished with the rest, we will have a record percentages. Our percentage will be a record, except for one person. One person has a higher percentage than your favorite President, Donald Trump. Do you know who that President is? He's got a higher percentage than me, and it's devastating. His name is George Washington. [Cheers and applause.] "", ""George is at 100% and there is no way I'm going to get there no matter what. I tell you. 100%. Well, he was first, so he just appointed them all and that is it. That's going to be a hard record to beat. They want to take away your judges. They went to pack the Court with hard left ideologues. And they want to radicalize our judiciary. You know that. We already have a lot of that. [Booing.] "", ""Look at what they did to a great gentleman, Justice Kavanagh. Highly respected. [Booing.] They didn't just try to win. They tried to destroy him with false and malicious accusations. [Booing.]"", ""And thank you, Marco, and thank you Lindsay, wherever you may be. Thank you. \xa0Great job. Thank you. Stand up. [Cheers and applause.] \xa0Yean, Lindsey Graham was doing Ok in South Carolina, not great. Now he's through the roof. Great. Thank you. Great job. Great people. Great people, all of them. They tried to ruin the family of now-Justice Kavanagh. They tried to ruin his career, they tried to ruin his life. They even wanted to impeach him on fraudulent charges. [Booing.] "", 'Those charges were a fraud. He did nothing wrong. All in pursuit of political domination and control. Just imagine what this angry left-wing mob would do if they were in charge of this country. [Booing.] ', ""Imagine if we had a Democrat President and a Democrat Congress in 2020. [Booing.] They would shut down your free speech, use the power of the law to punish their opponents which they are trying to do now anyway. They'll always be trying to shield themselves. They would strip Americans of their constitutional rights while flooding the country with illegal immigrants in the hopes it will expand their political base, and they'll get votes someplace down the future. That's what it's about. [Booing.] "", 'CROWD:\xa0 Build that wall! Build that wall!', ""THE PRESIDENT: And we are building the wall. We're going to have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year. It's moving rapidly. It's moving very rapidly. And you know, we couldn't get the wall approved by the Democrats, even though they voted for it four years ago, and six years ago, and it didn't get built. But they voted for it. All of a sudden, Trump is President, we don't want a wall. Could you imagine, can you imagine those caravans without having the barriers and walls that we've already put up and that are up? This country would be a mess like you wouldn't believe."", ""So the wall is moving along. It's moving along rapidly.\xa0 It's beautiful. I changed the design. It's stronger, bigger, better, and cheaper. Cheaper.\xa0 A lot cheaper. You know, sometimes when they don't give you the money, you have to make it cheaper. Not gonna happen.\xa0 But it's going well."", ""Instead of bringing us together as one America, Democrats want to splinter us into factions and tribes. They want us divided. Not gonna happen to the Republicans anymore. It's not gonna to happen. [Cheers and applause.] "", ""This election is not merely a verdict on the amazing progress we've made. It's a verdict on the un-American conduct of those who tried to undermine our great democracy and undermine you. [Cheers and applause.] "", ""And by the way, on July 4th in Washington, D.C., come on down, we're gonna have a big day. Bring your flags. Bring those flags. Bring those American flags. July 4th. We're going to have hundreds of thousands of people. We're going to celebrate America. Sounds good, right? July 4. Celebrate America."", 'This election is a verdict on whether we want to live in a country where the people who lose an election refused to concede and spend the next two years trying to shred our Constitution and rip your country apart. [Booing.] ', 'You remember, during one of the debates when crooked Hillary said, ""if I win, are you going to support me?"" But I must be honest. I didn\'t give her a great answer.\xa0 That was a very. . . that might have been my hardest question during the debates. Isn\'t it amazing that it worked the other way around? Isn\'t it amazing? [Applause.]', 'If you want to know how the system is rigged, just compare how they came after us for three years with everything they had versus the free pass they gave to Hillary and her aides after they set up an illegal server, destroyed evidence, deleted and acid washed 33,000 emails, exposed classified information, and turned the State Department into a pay-for-play cash machine. [Booing.] ', 'CROWD:\xa0 Lock her up!\xa0 Lock her up!', 'THE PRESIDENT:\xa0 33,000 emails deleted! Think of it. I keep mentioning, you know, there was a lot of corruption on the other side. But, you know, the simplest thing. \xa0They get a subpoena from the United States Congress, and they decide that they are not gonna give it. So, Lindsey Graham, they delete and they acid wash, which is very expensive, nobody does it, they acid wash those emails. Never to be seen again. But we may find them somewhere deep in the State Department. We may. [Applause.] ', ""But can you imagine if I got a subpoena--think of this. If I got a subpoena for emails, if I deleted one email like a love note to Melania, it's the electric chair for Trump. [Laughter.] 33,000 emails. But let's see what happens. We now have a great Attorney General. Let's see what happens. [Cheers and applause.] "", ""So, if you want to shut down this rigged system once and for all, the show up November 3.

Remember, the only thing these corrupt politicians will understand is an earthquake at the ballot box. That's what they will understand. And they're gonna see it."", ""We did it once, and now we will do it again. And this time, we're going to finish the job. This time should be a lot easier because we've done so much with our military, with our vets, with the Second Amendment, with our regulations, with the biggest tax cut in history, with getting rid of so many different problems, so many different things, including, by the way, the individual mandate of Obamacare. One of the worst things anybody's ever had to live through. We got rid of the individual mandate. Right? [Applause.] How many people are happy they no longer have to pay for the privilege of not paying for bad health insurance? How many people are happy? Bad health care! [Applause.] "", ""So, every time you don't have to make out a check in order not to have health care, think of that. Think of that. This is the only country, you pay for the very distinct privilege of not having to pay. But you hadda pay a lot. Now you don't have to pay any more. You don't want it, you don't have to take it. The individual mandate, Mike, we got rid of it. That was a big deal."", 'The people trying to stop our movement are the same Washington insiders who spent their careers rigging the system so your losses will be their gains. You know that. These are the same career politicians who presided over decades of flat wages, the loss of our manufacturing jobs 60, 000--can you believe that? 60,000. Who would believe that number? And you know how I know it\'s true? Because, if it wasn\'t--I have been using it a lot--the fake news would have headlines: ""Trump used a phony number."" They\'d have headlines.\xa0 It\'d be the biggest story. Trump used. . well. . . they never corrected it, so I assume, fellas, those 60,000 shuttered factories, we closed up 60,000 factories.', ""It didn't seem right. It didn't seem like it would be possible. An avalanche of job-killing regulations. A growing wealth gap. And one ruinous trade deal after another.

We've to get the Democrats to approve it. We want it to be bipartisan."", ""As you know, you may have read a couple of things about China. I spoke to President Xi, terrific President, a great leader of China. I spoke to him this morning at length, and we'll see what happens. But we're either goin' ta have a good deal, a fair deal, we're not going to have a deal at all, and that is ok too. [Applause.] Because we are taking in billions and billions of dollars into our Treasury and companies are leaving China because they want to avoid paying these large tariffs. And by the way, when the fake news tells you that you're paying, in the case of China, they've devalued their currency. That helps them. And you know what else they are doing? They are subsidizing those companies. And you're not paying very much if you're paying anything at all, in the case of China. And we're taking billions and billions of dollars in. And remember this, and you know it I as well as I do, we've never taken in $.10 from China. We would lose $500 billion a year with China. We rebuilt China.

She said ""deplorables and irredeemables."" I think that was worse, but it did not get picked up. You never know what\'s goin\' ta get picked up. I think ""irredeemables"" is worse than ""deplorables."" But, I\'ll never forget, I was making a speech the next day.

The unemployment rate is the lowest rate it's been in over 51 years. Think of that. And as I said before, about African-American, I now say also about Hispanic-American, and Asian-American unemployment, have reached the lowest rates in the history of our country. Unemployment. And African-American poverty has also reached by far, the lowest rate in history. These are incredible numbers. And today, right now, as we speak, almost 160 million people are working.

Has secured commitments to provide private sector training opportunities to nearly 10 million Americans. It's been an incredible story. It's been an incredible story. Great job. To get relief to working families, we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history, the largest.

Many, many plants are now under construction in Michigan and Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida. They hadn't built one in decades, and now, they are all over the place. In my first week, I withdrew the United States from the job-killing catastrophe, that we know what that is, TPP and the Paris Environmental Accord. Not too good. Not too good. I thought I was going to take a lotta heat on that, I took none. Would have cost us trillions and trillions of dollars.

But we need you to call your Democrat congressman and your Democrat senator and get them to pass legislation working with these great men over here to close up the loopholes and to solve the asylum problem which can be done in 15 minutes.

No one who supports sanctuary cities should be allowed to run for President of the United States.

The are so many great things we can do right now in a bipartisan way. But they have been afflicted with an ideological sickness that protects foreign borders but refuses to protect our borders. That promotes jobs overseas but allows our factories to close. That promotes democracy abroad, but shreds our Constitution at home. That declares support for free speech and free thought, but relentlessly suppresses them both. And that constantly savages the heroes of American law enforcement. We don't want that.

4,            Donald J. Trump          ,"November 05, 2020","[""Good evening. I'd like to provide the American people with an update on our efforts to protect the integrity of our very important 2020 election. If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us. If you count the votes that came in late—we're looking at them very strongly. But a lot of votes came in late."", ""I've already decisively won many critical States, including massive victories in Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, to name just a few. We won these and many other victories despite historic election interference from big media, big money, and big tech."", ""As everybody saw, we won by historic numbers. And the pollsters got it knowingly wrong. They got it knowingly wrong. We had polls that were so ridiculous, and everybody knew that at the time. There was no blue wave that they predicted. They thought there was going to be a big blue wave; that was false. That was done for suppression reasons. But instead, there was a big red wave. And it's been properly acknowledged, actually, by the media. They were, I think, very impressed, but that was after the fact. That doesn't do us any good."", ""We kept the Senate, despite having twice as many seats to defend as Democrats. And in a really—much more competitive States, we've—we did a fantastic job with the Senate. I think we're very proud of what's happened there. We had many more seats to defend."", ""They spent almost $200 million on Senate races in South Carolina and Kentucky alone—two races—and hundreds of millions of dollars overall against us. At the national level, our opponents' major donors were Wall Street bankers and special interests. Our major donors were police officers, farmers, everyday citizens. Yet, for the first time ever, we lost zero races in the House. I was talking to Kevin McCarthy today. He said he couldn't believe it: zero races. Very unusual thing. Zero. And actually won many new seats with, I think, many more on the way."", ""This was also the year of the Republican woman. More Republican women were elected to Congress than ever before. That's a great achievement. I won the largest share of non-White voters of any Republican in 60 years, including historic numbers of Latino, African American, Asian American, and Native American voters—the largest ever in our history. We grew our party by 4 million voters, the greatest turnout in Republican Party history."", ""Democrats are the party of the big donors, the big media, the big tech, it seems. And Republicans have become the party of the American worker, and that's what's happened. And we're also, I believe, the party of inclusion."", 'As everyone now recognizes, media polling was election interference, in the truest sense of that word, by powerful special interests. These really phony polls—I have to call them phony polls, fake polls—were designed to keep our voters at home, create the illusion of momentum for Mr. Biden, and diminish Republicans\' ability to raise funds. They were what\'s called ""suppression polls."" Everyone knows that now. And it\'s never been used to the extent that it\'s been used on this last election.', 'To highlight just a few examples: The day before election, Quinnipiac—which was wrong on every occasion that I know of—had Joe Biden up by 5 points in Florida, and they were off by 8.4 points. And I won Florida easily. Easily. So they had me losing Florida by a lot, and I ended up winning Florida by a lot. Other than that, they were very accurate. They had him up 4 points in Ohio, and they were off by 12.2 points. And I also won Ohio—the great State of Ohio—very easily.', ""The Washington Post had Biden up 17 points in Wisconsin, and it was basically even. They were off by about 17 points, and they knew that. They're not stupid people. They knew that. Suppression."", ""There are now only a few States yet to be decided in the Presidential race. The voting apparatus of those States are run, in all cases, by Democrats. We were winning in all the key locations by a lot, actually. And then, our numbers started miraculously getting whittled away in secret, and they wouldn't allow legally permissible observers. We went to court, in a couple of instances, and we were able to get the observers put in. And when the observers got there, they wanted them 60, 70 feet away, 80 feet, 100 feet away—or outside the building to observe people inside the building."", ""And we won a case—a big case. And we have others happening. There are a lot of—lots of litigation. Even beyond our litigation, there's tremendous amount of litigation generally because of how unfair this process was, and I predicted that. I've been talking about mail-in voting for a long time. It's really destroyed our system."", ""It's a corrupt system. And it makes people corrupt even if they aren't by nature, but they become corrupt; it's too easy. They want to find out how many votes they need, and then they seem to be able to find them. They wait and wait, and then they find them."", 'And you see that on election night. We were ahead in votes in North Carolina by a lot—tremendous number of votes. And we\'re still ahead by a lot, but not as many, because they\'re finding ballots all of a sudden. ""Oh, we have some mail-in ballots.""', ""It's amazing how those mail-in ballots are so one-sided too. I know that it's supposed to be to the advantage of the Democrats, but in all cases, they're so one-sided."", ""We were up by nearly 700,000 votes in Pennsylvania. I won Pennsylvania by a lot, and that gets whittled down to—I think they said now we're up by 90,000 votes. And they'll keep coming and coming and coming. They find them all over. And they don't want us to have any observers, although we won a court case. The judge said you have to have observers."", ""Likewise, in Georgia—and they're appealing. Actually, they're appealing. We won a case that we want people to watch, and we want observers, and they're actually appealing, which is sort of interesting. I wonder why they'd appeal—that all we want to do is have people watch as they do the vote tabulations."", ""Likewise, in Georgia, I won by a lot—a lot—with a lead of over—getting close to 300,000 votes on election night in Georgia. And by the way, got whittled down, and now it's getting to be to a point where I'll go from winning by a lot to perhaps being even down a little bit."", 'In Georgia, a pipe burst in a faraway location, totally unrelated to the location of what was happening, and they stopped counting for four hours, and a lot of things happened. The election apparatus in Georgia is run by Democrats.', 'We also had margins of 300,000 in Michigan. We were way up in Michigan, won the State. And in Wisconsin, we did likewise fantastically well. And that got whittled down. Every—in every case, they got whittled down.', ""Today we're on track to win Arizona. We only need to carry, I guess, 55 percent of the remaining vote—55 percent margins. And that's a margin that we've significantly exceeded. So we'll see what happens with that, but we're on track to do okay in Arizona. Our goal is to defend the integrity of the election. We'll not allow the corruption to steal such an important election or any election, for that matter. And we can't allow silence—anybody to silence our voters and manufacture results."", ""I've never had—I've been doing a lot of public things for a long time; I've never had anything that's been as inspirational by people—calling, talking, sending things to us. I've never seen such—such love and such affection and such spirit as I've seen for this. People know what's happening, and they see what's happening, and it's before their eyes."", ""And there are many instances which will be reported very shortly. There's tremendous litigation going on. And this is a case where they're trying to steal an election, they're trying to rig an election, and we can't let that happen. Detroit and Philadelphia—known as two of the most corrupt political places anywhere in our country, easily—cannot be responsible for engineering the outcome of a Presidential race—a very important Presidential race."", ""In Pennsylvania, Democrats have gone to the State Supreme Court to try and ban our election observers and very strongly. Now, we won the case, but they're going forward. They don't want anybody in there. They don't want anybody watching them as they count the ballots, and I can't imagine why. There's absolutely no legitimate reason why they would not want to have people watching this process, because if it's straight, they would be—they should be proud of it. Instead, they're trying, obviously, to commit fraud. There's no question about that."", ""In Philadelphia, observers have been kept far away—very far away—so far that people are using binoculars to try and see, and there's been tremendous problems caused. They put paper on all of the windows so you can't see in, and the people that are banned are very unhappy and become somewhat violent."", ""The 11th Circuit ruled that, in Georgia, the votes have been in by election day—that they should be in by election day, and they weren't. Votes are coming in after election day. And they had a ruling already that you have to have the votes in by election day. To the best of my knowledge, votes should be in by election day, and they didn't do that."", ""Democrat officials never believed they could win this election honestly. I really believe that. That's why they did the mail-in ballots, where there's tremendous corruption and fraud going on. That's why they mailed out tens of millions of unsolicited ballots without any verification measures whatsoever. And I've told everybody that these things would happen, because I've seen it happen. I watched a lot of different elections before they decided to go with this big, massive election with tens of millions of ballots going out to everybody, in many cases, totally unsolicited."", ""This was unprecedented in American history. This was by design. Despite years of claiming to care about the election security, they refuse to include any requirement to verify signatures, identities, or even determine whether they're eligible or ineligible to vote. People are walking in that they have no idea; they're just taking numbers. They're writing down things—the workers—and doing a lot of bad things. And we have a lot of information coming and litigation that you'll see that will shake even you people up, and you've seen it all."", ""The officials overseeing the counting in Pennsylvania and other key States are all part of a corrupt Democrat machine that you've written about—and, for a long time, you've been writing about the corrupt Democrat machine. I went to school there, and I know a lot about it. It hasn't changed. It's a long time ago, and it hasn't changed. It's gotten worse."", ""In Pennsylvania, partisan Democrats have allowed ballots in the State to be received 3 days after the election, and we think much more than that. And they are counting those without even postmarks or any identification whatsoever. So you don't have postmarks; you don't have identification. There have been a number of disturbing irregularities across the Nation. Our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit. Detroit is another place."", ""So you don't have postmarks; you don't have identification. There have been a number of disturbing irregularities across the Nation. Our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit. Detroit is another place—and I wouldn't say has the best reputation for election integrity."", ""Poll workers in Michigan were duplicating ballots. But when our observers attempted to challenge the activity, those poll workers jumped in front of the volunteers to block their view so that they couldn't see what they were doing, and it became a little bit dangerous."", ""One major hub for counting ballots in Detroit covered up the windows, again, with large pieces of cardboard. And so they wanted to protect and block the counting area. They didn't want anybody seeing the counting, even though these were observers who are legal observers that were supposed to be there."", ""In Detroit, there were hours of unexplained delay in delivering many of the votes for counting. The final batch did not arrive until 4 in the morning and—even though the polls closed at 8 o'clock. So they brought it in, and the batches came in, and nobody knew where they came from. We've also been denied access to observe in critical places in Georgia."", 'In multiple swing States, counting was halted for hours and hours on election night, with results withheld from major Democrat-run locations, only to appear later. And they certainly appeared, and they all had the name ""Biden"" on them or just about all—I think almost all. They all had the name ""Biden"" on them, which is a little strange.', 'I challenge Joe and every Democrat to clarify that they only want legal votes. Because they talk about votes, and I think they should use the word ""legal""—""legal votes."" ""We want every legal vote counted."" And I want every legal vote counted. We want openness and transparency—no secret count rooms, no mystery ballots, no illegal votes being cast after election day.', ""You have election day, and the laws are very strong on that. You have an election day. And they don't want votes cast after election day, and they want the process to be an honest one. It's so important. We want an honest election, and we want an honest count, and we want honest people working back there because it's a very important job."", ""So that's the way this country is going to win. That's the way the United States will win. And we think we will win the election very easily. We think there's going to be a lot of litigation, because we have so much evidence, so much proof. And it's going to end up, perhaps, at the highest court in the land. We'll see. But we think there'll be a lot of litigation because we can't have an election stolen by—like this."", ""And I tell you, I would—I have been talking about this for many months with all of you. And I've said very strongly that mail-in ballots are going to end up being a disaster. Small elections were a disaster. Small, very easy-to-handle elections were disastrous."", ""This is a large-scale version, and it's getting worse and worse every day. We're hearing stories that are horror stories—absolute horror stories. And we can't let that happen to the United States of America. It's not a question of who wins—Republican, Democrat; Joe, myself. We can't let that happen to our country. We can't be disgraced by having something like this happen."", ""So it will be, hopefully, cleared up, maybe soon; I hope soon. But it will probably go through a process—a legal process. And, as you know, I've claimed certain States, and he's claiming States. So we can both claim the States, but ultimately, I have a feeling judges are going to have to rule. But there's been a lot of shenanigans, and we can't stand for that in our country. Thank you very much.""]",0

Trump          ,"December 02, 2020","['[APP Note: The claims about election fraud contained in this transcript are disputed and not supported by evidence as determined by state and Federal courts in numerous hearings.]', ""Thank you. This may be the most important speech I've ever made. I want to provide an update on our ongoing efforts to expose the tremendous voter fraud and irregularities which took place during the ridiculously long November 3rd elections. We used to have what was called Election Day. Now we have election days, weeks, and months, and lots of bad things happened during this ridiculous period of time, especially when you have to prove almost nothing to exercise our greatest privilege, the right to vote."", 'As President, I have no higher duty than to defend the laws and the Constitution of the United States. That is why I am determined to protect our election system, which is now under coordinated assault and siege. For months leading up to the presidential election, we were warned that we should not declare a premature victory.', ""We were told repeatedly that it would take weeks, if not months, to determine the winner, to count the absentee ballots, and to verify the results. My opponent was told to stay away from the election. Don't campaign. We don't need you, we've got it. This election is done. In fact, they were acting like they already knew what the outcome was going to be."", 'They had it covered. And perhaps they did, very sadly for our country. It was all very, very strange. Within days after the election, we witnessed an orchestrated effort to anoint a winner, even while many key states were still being counted. The Constitutional process must be allowed to continue. We are going to defend the honesty of the vote by ensuring that every legal ballot is counted and that no illegal ballot is counted.', ""This is not just about honoring the votes of 74 million Americans who voted for me. It's about ensuring that Americans can have faith in this election, and in all future elections. Today I will detail some of the shocking irregularities, abuses, and fraud that have been revealed in recent weeks. But before laying out just a small portion of the evidence we have uncovered, and we have so much evidence, I want to explain the corrupt mail-in balloting scheme that Democrats systematically put into place that allowed voting to be altered, especially in swing states, which they had to win."", ""They just didn't know that it was going to be that tough, because we were leading in every swing state by so much, far greater than they ever thought possible. While it has long been understood that the Democrat political machine engages in voter fraud, from Detroit to Philadelphia to Milwaukee, Atlanta, so many other places, what changed this year was the Democrat party's relentlessly push to print and mail out tens of millions of ballots, sent to unknown recipients with virtually no safeguards of any kind."", 'This allowed fraud and abuse to occur on a scale never seen before. Using the pandemic as a pretext, Democrat politicians and judges drastically changed election procedures, just months, and in some cases, weeks, before the election on the 3rd of November. Very rarely were legislatures involved, and Constitutionally, they had to be involved.', ""But very, very rarely, and you'll see that as we continue to file our suits, it's Constitutionally, absolutely incorrect what took place, even from a legal standpoint. Many states, such as Nevada and California, sent millions of live ballots to every person on their voter rolls, whether those individuals had requested ballots or not."", ""Whether they were dead or alive, they got ballots. Other states, such as Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin, instituted universal absentee balloting, right in the middle of an election year, sending absentee ballot request forms to all voters, on all rolls. It didn't matter who they were. This colossal expansion of mail-in voting opened the floodgates to massive fraud."", ""It's a widely known fact that the voting rolls are packed with people who are not lawfully eligible to vote, including those who are deceased, have moved out of their state and even are non-citizens of our country. Beyond this, the records are riddled with errors, wrong addresses, duplicate entries and many other issues."", ""This is not disputed. It has never been disputed. Dozens of counties in the key swing states have more registered voters on the roles than they have voting age citizens, including 67 counties in Michigan. All of this is evidence. In Wisconsin, the state's board of elections could not confirm the residency of more than 100,000 people, but repeatedly refused to remove those names from its voter roles before the election."", ""They knew why, nobody else did. I knew why. They're illegal voters. It is a travesty that in the year 2020 we do not have any means of verifying the eligibility of those who cast ballots in an election, and such an important election it is, for determining who they are, whether they live in the state or whether they are even American citizens."", 'We have no idea. We have, in all swing states, major infractions or outright fraud, which is far more in numbers or votes than we need to overturn the results of a state. In other words, in Wisconsin, as an example, where we were way up on election night, they ultimately had us miraculously losing by 20,000 votes.', ""And I can show you right here that Wisconsin, we're leading by a lot, and then at 3:42 in the morning there was this. It was a massive dump of votes. Mostly Biden. Almost all Biden. And to this day, everyone's trying to figure out where did it come from? But I went from leading by a lot to losing by a little."", ""And that's right here. That's at 3:42 in the morning, that's Wisconsin. A terrible thing. Terrible, terrible thing. But we will have far more, many times more, than the 20,000 votes needed to overturn the state. If we are right about the fraud, Joe Biden can't be President. We're talking about hundreds of thousands of votes, we're talking about numbers like nobody has ever seen before."", ""Just as an example, in certain states, we'll be down by let's say 7,000 votes, but we'll find later on 20,000. 50,000. 100,000. 200,000 discrepancies or fraudulent votes and that includes votes that went through when they were not allowed to be seen by Republican poll watchers because the poll watchers were locked out of the building."", 'Or that people that innocently came to vote on November 3rd, who were all excited about their vote, they were happy, they were proud to be citizens of the United States of America and they went up and they said, ""I\'d like to vote,"" and they were told that they can\'t vote. ""I\'m sorry,"" they were told. ""I\'m sorry. You\'ve already voted by mail-in ballot. Congratulations. We received a ballot, so you can no longer vote."" They didn\'t know what to do. They had no one to complain to. Most just left and said, ""That\'s strange."" But many people complained and complained vehemently. And in a lot of cases, they filled out a provisional ballot, which was almost never used but in virtually every case was a vote for Trump.', 'In other words, they went in to vote and they were told that they voted, and they didn\'t vote. And they left and they felt horror and they lost respect for our system, and this happened tens of thousands of times all over the country. That\'s how desperate the Democrats were. They would fill out ballots of people, not even knowing if these people were going to show up, and when they did show up they said, ""Sorry. You\'ve already voted."" And on top of everything else, we have a company that\'s very suspect. It\'s name is Dominion. With a turn of a dial, with a change of a chip, you can press a button for Trump and the vote goes to Biden. What kind of a system is this? We have to go to paper. Maybe it takes longer. But the only secure system is paper, not these systems that nobody understands including in many cases the people that run them.', ""Although, unfortunately, I think they understand them far too well. In one Michigan county, as an example, that used Dominion systems, they found that nearly 6000 votes had been wrongly switched from Trump to Biden. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. This is what we caught. How many didn't we catch?"", ""Are there hundreds of other examples throughout the country? Are there thousands? We just got lucky and they called it a glitch. But we found numerous glitches that evening. 96% of the company's political donations went to Democrats, not surprisingly. And frankly, when you look at who's running the company, who's in charge, who owns it, which we don't know, where are the votes counted, which we think are counted in foreign countries, not in the United States."", 'Dominion is a disaster. Election authorities in Texas have repeatedly blocked the deployment of Dominion systems due to concerns about security, vulnerabilities and the potential for errors and outright fraud. Every district that uses Dominion systems must be carefully monitored and carefully investigated.', ""But not only for the future, right now we're worried about the present and what went on with an election that we won without question. Under my lead the Republicans won almost every State House in the United States, which they weren't expected to do. We won up to 16 seats in the House. The numbers are still being tabulated because there are nine seats that nobody really knows."", ""They don't know. They're still, two weeks later, still under consideration because it's a mess. Republicans were supposed to lose many seats and instead they won those seats in the House. And a very important election that's coming up will determine whether or not we hold the Senate. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler are two tremendous people."", ""Unfortunately, in Georgia they're using the same horrible Dominion system, and it's already been out that hundreds of thousands -- Think of it. Hundreds of thousands of absentee ballots have been requested. You check it out who's requesting those ballets. The difference is, it's one state and we will have our eyes on it like nobody's ever watched anything before because we have to win those two Senate seats."", ""The tremendous success we had in the House of Representatives and the tremendous success we've had so far in the Senate, unexpected success all over the country and right here in Washington. It is statistically impossible that the person, me, that led the charge lost. The greatest pollsters, the real pollsters, not the ones that had us down 17 points in Wisconsin when we actually won."", ""Or the ones that had us down four or five points in Florida, and we won by many points. Or had us even and down in Texas, and we won by a lot. Not those pollsters, but real pollsters. Pollsters that are fair and honest said we can't understand a thing like this. It's never happened before. You led the country to victory, and you were the only one that was lost."", 'It\'s not possible. The Speaker of the House of a certain state said, ""Sir, I expected to lose my seat, and instead because of you and because of that incredible charge and all of those rallies, we had a tremendous victory."" And everybody knows it. You were much more popular than me, sir. Except I got many more votes than you did.', ""And it's impossible that that happened. There is something wrong. I'll tell you what's wrong. Voter fraud. Here's an example. This is Michigan. At 6:31 in the morning, a vote dump of 149,772 votes came in. Unexpectedly. We were winning by a lot. That batch was received -- in horror. Nobody knows anything about it."", ""By the way, there's your line. This is one of many. Here's what is normal, and all of a sudden, look at that. This is normal? Normal? Look, even here. Normal? And then, boom. All of a sudden, I go from winning by a lot to losing a tight race. It's corrupt. Detroit is corrupt. I have a lot of friends in Detroit."", ""They know it. But Detroit is totally corrupt. Look at this; look at this. That's at 6:31 in the morning. Unexpectedly came in. In the recent recount in Georgia, which means nothing, because they don't want to check signatures. And if you're not going to check signatures in Georgia, it doesn't work. But we have a secretary of state and a governor who made it very difficult to check signatures."", ""Why? You'll have to ask them. But without a signature match or a check, it doesn't matter. They found thousands and thousands of votes that were out of whack. All against me. This was during a recount that I didn't even think mattered. They found many thousands of votes. And that recount didn't matter. The one that matters is the one that's going on now."", ""That because of the fact it's so close, they had to, by law, give another recount. But the recount has to be a recount where they check the signatures. Otherwise, they're just checking the same dishonest thing. It won't matter. In this case, the signatures on envelopes are the only thing that is relevant."", 'We will compare the signature on the envelope to the signatures from past elections. And we will find that many thousands of people signed these ballots illegally. The Democrats had this election rigged from the beginning. They used the pandemic, sometimes referred to as the China virus; where it originated; as an excuse to mail out tens of millions of ballots, which ultimately led to a big part of the fraud.', 'A fraud that the whole world is watching. And there is no one happier right now than China. Many people received two, three, and four ballots. They were sent to dead people by the thousands. In fact, dead people -- and we have many examples -- filled out ballots, made applications, and then voted. Which is even worse.', ""In other words, dead people went through a process. Some have been dead for 25 years. Millions of votes were cast illegally in the swing states alone. And if that's the case, the results of the individual swing states must be overturned, and overturned immediately. Some people say that's too far out. That's too harsh."", ""Well, does that mean we take a president; and we've just elected a president; where the votes were fraudulent? No. It means you have to turn over the election. And everybody knows, without going much further; and they've seen the evidence, but they don't want to talk about it. What a disaster this election was."", 'A total catastrophe. But we\'re going to show it, and hopefully the courts; in particular, the Supreme Court of the United States; will see it. And respectfully, hopefully, they will do what\'s right for our country. Because our country cannot live with this kind of an election. We could say, ""Let\'s go on to the next one."" But no, we have to look also at our past.', ""We can't let this happen. Maybe you'll have a re-vote, but I don't think that's appropriate. When those votes are corrupt, when they're irregular, when they get caught, they're terminated. And I very easily win, in all states, I very easily win these swing states, ust like I won them at 10 o'clock in the evening, the evening of the election -- So we're not looking to show you 25 faulty or fraudulent votes which don't mean anything because it doesn't overturn the state."", ""Or 50 or 100. We're showing you hundreds of thousands, far more than we need, far more than the margin, far more than the law requires. We can show many times what is necessary to win the state. The media knows this, but they don't wanna report it. In fact, they outright refuse to even cover it because they know the result if they do."", ""Even what I'm saying now will be demeaned and disparaged, but that's okay. I just keep on going forward because I'm representing 74 million people, and in fact I'm also representing all of the people that didn't vote for me. The mail in voting scam is the latest part of their four year effort to overturn the results of the 2016 election, and it's been like living in hell."", ""Our opponents have proven many times, again and again, that they will say and do anything to get back into power. The corrupt forces who are registering dead voters and stuffing ballot boxes are the same people who have perpetrated one phony and fraudulent hoax after another. You've been watching it now for four years."", ""These entrenched interests oppose our movement because we put America first. They don't put America first. And we're returning power to you, the American people. They don't want America first. They only want power for themselves. They want to make money. That's why they don't want me as your President. I've been investigated from soon after I announced I was running for President."", 'When I immediately went to number one in the Republican primary polls, the investigations never stopped. They went on for four years, and I won them all, I beat them all. Russia, Russia, Russia. The impeachment hoax, and so much more. Robert Mueller spent $48 million of taxpayer money investigating me for two and a half years, issued over 2,800 subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants, issued 230 orders for communications records, and conducted 500 witness interviews all looking to take me down.', 'There was no collusion in the end. None whatsoever. Senator Marco Rubio, the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, stated, ""The Committee found no evidence that then-candidate Donald Trump, or his campaign, colluded with the Russian government."" And I thank Senator Rubio for that statement. Now I hear that these same people that failed to get me in Washington have sent every piece of information to New York so that they can try to get me there.', 'It\'s all been gone over, over and over again. For $48 million, you go through tax returns, you go through everything. The New York Attorney General, who recently ran for office, campaigned without knowing me, stating, ""We will join with law enforcement and other Attorneys General across this nation in removing this President from office."" I never met her. ""It\'s important that everybody understands,"" she said, ""That the days of Donald Trump are coming to an end."" And all it\'s been is a big investigation in Washington and New York and any place else they can investigate, because that\'s what they want to do.', 'They want to take not me but us down, and we can never let them do that. Everything\'s been looked at. Friend of mine who is very smart said, ""You\'ve probably seen more than anybody else. You\'ve probably been investigated more than anybody else, and for you to come out with a clean bill of health makes you probably the cleanest person in this country."" Some people in this administration, but fortunately not all, have been beaten down and disparaged.', ""They just disappeared. Nobody knows what happened to them. Why are they active? Why aren't they involved? There's so much to be involved in. The corruption is so rampant. They just couldn't take it anymore. They were threatened by Democrats with impeachment and horrible things were said about them, and they're good people."", ""Even recently, the head of the GSA was hounded and harassed as she reported, like she has never been before. What can I say? We caught Komi cold, we caught McCabe cold, we caught them all. We're still waiting for a report from a man named Durham, who I have never spoken to and I have never met. They can go after me before the election as much as they want, but unfortunately, Mr."", ""Durham didn't want to go after these people or have anything to do with going after them before the election. So who knows if he is ever going to even do a report, but if you look at the lies and the leaks and the illegal acts of behavior done by so many people and their desire to hurt the president of the United States, something should happen."", ""The hardest thing I have to do is explain why nothing is happening with all of these people that got caught spying on my campaign. It's never happened before, and it should never happen again to a president of the United States. All you have to do is watch the hearings and see for yourself. The evidence is overwhelming."", 'The fraud that we\'ve collected in recent weeks is overwhelming, having to do with our election. Everyone is saying, ""Wow, the evidence is overwhelming,"" when they get to see it. But really, it\'s too late to change the course of an election. It\'s too late to change the outcome. In fact, there is still plenty of time to certify the correct winner of the election and that\'s what we\'re fighting to do.', 'But no matter when it happens, when they see fraud, when they see false votes, and when those votes number far more than is necessary, you can\'t let another person steal that election from you. All over the country, people are together in holding up signs, ""Stop the steal."" To understand how we will challenge this fraud, it is important to know the problems with mail-in balloting.', 'Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, Georgia, Arizona, and most other states allowed anyone to get an absentee ballot and cast their vote without showing any ID. The voting took place entirely on the honor system, no identification of any kind was required. Most Americans would also be shocked to learn that no state in the country verifies United States citizenship as a condition for voting in federal elections.', 'This is a national disgrace. No other advanced country conducts elections this way. Many European countries have instituted major restrictions on mail-in voting specifically because they recognize the nearly unlimited potential for fraud. Out of 42 European nations, all but two prohibit absentee ballots entirely for people who reside inside the country, or else they require those who need absentee ballots to show a very, very powerful ID.', 'Throughout the Democrat effort to dramatically expand mail-in voting, the Democrat Party leaders were also feverishly working to block measures designed to protect against fraud, such as signature verification, residency verification, or voter ID. And citizenship confirmation was almost unthought of, that we should ask for it.', 'Can you believe this? These are not the actions of people who want fair elections. These are the actions of people who want to steal elections, who are willing to create fraud. The only conceivable reason why you would block common sense measures to verify legal eligibility for voting is you are trying to encourage, enable, solicit, or carry out fraud.', 'It is important for Americans to understand that these destructive changes to our election laws were not a necessary response to the pandemic. The pandemic simply gave the Democrats an excuse to do what they have been trying to do for many, many years. In fact, the very first bill that House Democrats introduced when Nancy Pelosi became speaker was an attempt to mandate universal mail-in voting and eliminate measures such as voter ID, which is so necessary.', ""Dramatically eroding the integrity of our elections was the Democrat's number one priority for a simple reason. They wanted to steal the 2020 presidential election. All of the Democrat efforts to expand mail-in balloting laid the groundwork for the systematic and pervasive fraud that occurred in this election."", ""In Pennsylvania, large amounts of mail-in and absentee ballots were processed illegally and in secret in Philadelphia and Allegheny counties without our observers present. They were not allowed to be present. In fact, they weren't even allowed in the same room. They were thrown out of the building and they looked from outside in, but they had no way of even seeing because there were no windows, and the windows that were there were boarded up."", ""Democrats even went to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to block observers from receiving access. There is only one possible reason that the corrupt Democrat political machine would oppose transparency during the vote counting. It's because they know they are hiding illegal activity, it's very simple. This is an egregious, inexcusable and irreversible harm that stains the entire election, yet this unprecedented practice of excluding our observers, our vote watchers, as some people call them, occurred in Democrat run cities in key states all across the nation."", ""Here are just some of the additional facts that we've uncovered. Many voters all across Pennsylvania received two ballots in the mail and many others received mail-in ballots for which they never applied. So many got ballots, they didn't even know what they were for. And again, so many received more than one ballot, in some cases more than two ballots, and they happened to be, for the most part, Democrats."", ""In Fayette County, Pennsylvania, multiple voters received ballots that were already filled out. They didn't know what happened. In Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, a poll watcher overheard unregistered voters being told to return later to try to vote under a different name. Tens of thousands of voters across Pennsylvania were treated differently based on whether they were Republicans or Democrats."", ""Voters who submitted flawed ballots in some Democrat precincts were notified and asked to fix their ballot while Republican precincts and in particular, Republican voters, were not so notified, which plainly violates the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution. If you are a Democrat, we're going to fix up your ballot, make sure it's perfect."", ""If you are a Republican, don't even talk about it. In Michigan, a career employee of the City of Detroit witnessed city workers coaching voters to vote straight Democrat while accompanying them to watch who they were voting for, violating the law and the sanctity of the secret ballot. You can't do that. The same worker say she was instructed not to ask for any ID and not to attempt to validate any signatures."", 'She was also told to illegally back date ballots, many, many ballots received after the deadline. This is something that is so unconstitutional, and she estimates that thousands and thousands of ballots were improperly back dated by her and many others. Other witnesses in Detroit also saw election officials counting batches of the same ballots many times as well as illegally duplicating ballots.', 'One observer testified to seeing boxes and boxes of ballots all bearing the same signature. Another observer in Detroit gave sworn testimony that he saw countless invalid ballots that did not belong to properly registered voters and then witnessed election workers in Wayne County entering fake birth dates into the system in order to illegally count them.', 'Witnesses have signed worn affidavits, in other words, you go to jail if you lie, testifying that after election officials announced the last absentee votes had been received a batch of tens of thousands of ballots arrived, many without envelopes or all voting for Democrats. In Wisconsin, a record number of voters were categorized as indefinitely confined, a status reserved for severely disabled individuals, also for the elderly that allow them to vote without showing ID.', ""Last year, approximately 70,000 people claimed this status statewide. This year, the number miraculously was nearly 250,000 voters after election officials in Milwaukee and Dane Counties, a couple of the most corrupt political places in our country, urged citizens to improperly register under this status, and register they did in levels that don't exist."", 'In Wisconsin, there are approximately 70,000 absentee ballots that do not have matching ballot applications as required by law. In Georgia, nine observers have testified to seeing countless irregular ballots without the creases or typical markings, indicating that the ballots did not arrive in envelopes as required.', 'A poll watcher in Fulton County estimated that approximately 98% of the large number of unusually pristine ballots that she witnessed were for Biden, a highly unusual number. In addition, thousands of uncounted ballots were discovered in Floyd, Fayette and Walton Counties weeks after the election, and these ballots were mostly from Trump voters.', ""They weren't counted, they were from Trump voters. In Detroit, everybody saw the tremendous conflict and the horrible way that the two Republican canvassers were treated, so horribly, because they wouldn't vote when they saw that 71% of the precincts didn't balance. And also, there were more votes than there were voters."", ""Think of that. You had more votes than you had voters. That's an easy one to figure, and it's by the thousands. In Arizona, in-person voters whose ballots produced error messages from tabulation machines were told to press a button that resulted in their votes not being counted. Also, in Arizona, the attorney general announced that mail-in ballots had been stolen from mailboxes and hidden under a rock."", ""In Clark County, Nevada, where most of the state's voters reside, the standards for matching a signature using the signature verification machine were intentionally lowered to allow large numbers of ballots to be counted that otherwise would never have passed muster. This machine was set at the lowest level."", 'According to one report, in order to test the process, nine voters in Clark County cast ballots with intentionally incorrect signatures, and eight of the nine ballots were accepted and counted. They said you could sign your name as Santa Claus, and it would be accepted. Last week, the Clark County commission threw out the results of a local election after the registrar reported finding, quote, ""discrepancies that we can\'t explain."" Also in Nevada, some voters were entered into a raffle for more than a dozen gift cards worth as much as $250 if they could prove they had voted.', 'This took place on Indian reservations. One of the most significant indications of widespread fraud is the extraordinarily low rejection rates for mail-in ballots in many key states. These are the states that I had to win. In swing state after swing state, the number of ballots rejected has been dramatically lower than what would have been expected based on prior experience.', ""That means years and years of voting. In Georgia, just 0.2%. That's substantially less than 1% of mail-in ballots have been rejected, in other words, almost none have been rejected. They took everything. Nothing was rejected, practically, compared to 6.4% in 2016, and there are those that think that 6.4% was a low number."", ""So think of it. Almost none were rejected and the previous election, 6.4% were rejected. We have seen similar declines in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Michigan. Ballots weren't rejected, especially if they happened to be in Democrat areas. These irregularities are inexplicable unless there is a deliberate effort to accept ineligible ballots or fraudulent ballots."", ""In Pennsylvania the Secretary of State and the state Supreme Court in essence abolished signature verification requirements just weeks prior to the election, in violation of state law. You're not allowed to do that. It has to be approved by the legislature. A judge can't do it, a state can't do it, an official can't do it."", 'The only one that can do it is the legislature. The reason for this is clear. They were not verifying signatures because they know the ballots have not been filled out by the voters in whose names they were cast. In other words, people filled them out that had nothing to do with the names on the ballot. A simple recount of the ballots under these circumstances only compounds the fraud.', 'The only way to determine whether there was an honest vote is to conduct a full review of the envelopes in the relevant states. You will find that many of them, tens of thousands, have fraudulent signatures. A full forensic audit is required to ensure that only legal ballots from lawfully registered voters that were properly cast are included in the final count.', ""This election is about great voter fraud, fraud that has never been seen like this before. It's about poll watchers who are not allowed to watch. So illegal. It's about ballots that poured in and nobody but a few knew where they came from, but they were counted, and they weren't for me. It's about big leads on election night, tremendous leads, leads where I was being congratulated for a decisive, easy victory, and all of a sudden by morning or a couple of days later, those leads rapidly evaporated."", ""It's about numbers of ballots that were sent that nobody know where they came from. It's about machinery that was defective, machinery that was stopped during certain parts of the evening, miraculously to open with more votes. It was about many other things, but above all it was about fraud. This election was rigged."", ""Everybody knows it. I don't mind if I lose an election, but I want to lose an election fair and square. What I don't want to do is have it stolen from the American people. That's what we're fighting for, and we have no choice to be doing that. We already have the proof, we already have the evidence, and it's very clear."", ""Many people in the media and even judges so far have refused to accept it. They know it's true, they know it's there, they know who won the election. But they refuse to say you're right. Our country needs somebody to say you're right. Ultimately, I am prepared to accept any accurate election result, and I hope that Joe Biden is as well."", ""But we already have the proof. We have already have tens of thousands of ballots more than we need to overturn all of these states that we're talking about. This is an election for the highest office in the greatest country in the history of the world. Every reasonable American should be able to agree based on what we have already documented that we need a systematic analysis of the mail-in ballots to review the envelopes."", ""It's about the signature, and if they're on the envelopes - we can only review the envelopes - and that will tell us everything. This is the absolute minimum we should expect. This is not just about my campaign, although it has a lot to do with who's going to be your next President. This is about restoring faith and confidence in American elections."", 'This is about our democracy and the sacred rights that generations of Americans have fought, bled, and died to secure. Nothing is more urgent or more important. The only ballots that should count in this election are those cast by eligible voters who are citizens of our country, residents of the states in which they voted, and who cast their ballots in a lawful manner before the legal deadline.', ""Moreover, we must never again have an election in which there is not a reliable and transparent system to verify the eligibility, identity, and residency of every single person who casts a ballot. A very, very cherished ballot. Many very smart people have congratulated me on all we've done. The biggest tax cuts in history, regulation cuts, the biggest in history."", 'We rebuilt our military, we took care of our vets like never before, Space Force and so much more. But then they went onto say, ""As big and as important as these events were, the single greatest achievement in your presidency will be exactly what you\'re doing right now."" Voter integrity for our nation. It\'s more important than any of the things that we discussed.', ""If we don't root out the fraud, the tremendous and horrible fraud that's taken place in our 2020 election, we don't have a country anymore. So, with the resolve and support of the American people, we will restore honesty and integrity to our elections and we will restore trust in our system of government. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.""]",0
